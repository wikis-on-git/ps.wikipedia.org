'''Ascariasis''' is a [[human]] [[disease]] caused by the [[parasite|parasitic]] [[roundworm]] '''''Ascaris lumbricoides'''''.  Perhaps as many as one quarter of the world's people are infected[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/8/5533], and ascariasis is particularly prevalent in [[tropics|tropical regions]] and in areas of poor [[hygiene]].  Other [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Ascaris]]'' are parasitic and can cause disease in [[list of domesticated animals|domestic animals]].

[[Infection]] occurs through ingestion of food contaminated with [[feces|fecal matter]] containing Ascaris [[egg (biology)|eggs]].  The [[larvae]] hatch, burrow through the [[intestine]], reach the [[lungs]], and finally migrate up the [[respiratory tract]].  From there they are then reswallowed and mature in the intestine, growing up to 30 [[Metre#SI multiples|cm]] (12 [[inch|in.]]) in length and anchoring themselves to the intestinal wall.

Infections are usually asymptomatic, especially if the number of worms is small. They may however be accompanied by [[inflammation]], [[fever]], and [[diarrhea]], and serious problems may develop if the worms migrate to other parts of the body.

==خپرېدا==
Roughly 1.5 billion individuals are infected with this worm{{ref|1}}.  Ascariasis is endemic in the [[United States]] including [[Gulf Coast]] and [[Ozark Mountains]]; in [[Nigeria]] and in [[Southeast Asia]]. One study indicated that the prevalence of ascariasis in the United States at about 4 million (2%). In a survey of a rural [[Nova Scotia]] community, 28.1% of 431 individuals tested were positive for Ascaris, all of them being under age 20, while all 276 tested in metropolitan [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] were negative{{ref|2}}.

Deposition of [[ovum|ova]] (eggs) in [[sewage]] hints at the degree of ascariasis incidence.  A [[1978]] study showed about 75% of all sewage [[sludge]] samples sampled in United States urban catchments contained Ascaris ova, with rates as high as 5 to 100 eggs per litre.  In [[Frankfort]], [[Indiana]], 87.5% of the sludge samples were positive with Ascaris, [[Toxocara]], [[trichinosis|Trichuris]], and [[hookworm]]. In [[Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], one of the 13 soil samples tested positive for Ascaris. Municipal wastewater in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] detected over 100 eggs per litre of wastewater {{ref|3}} and in [[Czechoslovakia]] was as high as 240-1050 eggs per litre {{ref|4}}.

Ascariasis sources can often be measured by examining food for ova.  In one field study in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], where raw sewage is used to fertilize crop fields, Ascaris eggs were detected at the rate of 0.18 eggs/kg in potatoes, 0.27 eggs/kg in turnip, 4.63 eggs/kg in mint, 0.7 eggs/kg in carrots, and 1.64 eggs/kg in radish{{ref|5}}.  A similar study in the same area showed that 73% of children working on these farms were infected with [[helminth]]s, particularly Ascaris, probably as a result of exposure to the raw sewage.

[[Image:Ascariasis LifeCycle - CDC Division of Parasitic Diseases.gif|frame|left|Adult worms (1) live in the lumen of the small intestine. A female may produce approximately 200,000 eggs per day, which are passed with the feces (2). Unfertilized eggs may be ingested but are not infective. Fertile eggs embryonate and become infective after 18 days to several weeks (3), depending on the environmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil). After infective eggs are swallowed (4), the larvae hatch (5), invade the intestinal mucosa, and are carried via the portal, then systemic circulation to the lungs . The larvae mature further in the lungs (6) (10 to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed (7). Upon reaching the small intestine, they develop into adult worms (8). Between 2 and 3 months are required from ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female. Adult worms can live 1 to 2 years.]]First appearance of eggs in stools is 60-70 days. In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4-16 days after infection.  The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever; observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. However there are generally few or no symptoms. A bolus of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause pneumonitis and [[eosinophilia]].

==Reservoir/source==
The source is direct transmission from humans by direct (skin) contact, and through soil and vegetation on which fecal matter containing eggs has been deposited. Ingestion of infective eggs from soil contaminated with human feces or transmission and contaminated vegetables and water is the primary route of infection. Intimate contact with pets which have been in contact with contaminated soil may result in infection, while pets which are infested themselves by a different type of roundworm can cause infection with that type of worm (Toxocara canis, etc) as occasionally occurs with groomers.

Transmission also comes through municipal recycling of wastewater into crop fields.  This is quite common in emerging industrial economies, and poses serious risks for not only local crop sales but also exports of contaminated vegetables.  A 1986 outbreak of ascariasis in [[Italy]] was traced to irresponsible wastewater recycling used to grow [[Balkan]] vegetable exports.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is usually incidental when the host passes a worm in the stool or vomit. Stool samples for ova and parasites will demonstrate Ascaris eggs.  Larvae may be found in gastric or respiratory secretions in pulmonary disease. Blood counts may demonstrate peripheral [[eosinophilia]].  On [[X-ray]], 15-35 cm long filling defects, sometimes with whirled appearance (bolus of worms).

==نښې نښانې==
Patients can remain asymptomatic for very long periods of time. As larval stages travel through the body, they may cause visceral damage, [[peritonitis]] and [[inflammation]], enlargement of the [[liver]] or [[spleen]], toxicity, and [[pneumonia]].  A heavy worm infestation may cause nutritional deficiency; other complications, sometimes fatal, include obstruction of the bowel by a bolus of worms (observed particularly in children) and obstruction of the [[bile]] or [[pancreas|pancreatic]] duct.  More than 796 Ascaris lumbricoides worms weighing 550&nbsp;[[gram|g]] [19 ounces] were recovered at autopsy from a 2-year-old South African girl. The worms had caused torsion and gangrene of the [[ileum]], which was interpreted as the cause of death{{ref|6}}.

Ascaris takes most of its nutrients from the partially digested host food in the [[intestine]].  There is limited evidence that it can also pierce the intestinal mucous membrane and feed on blood, but this is not its usual source of nutrition.[http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~schisto/Nematodes/Ascaris.html]  As a result, Ascaris infection does not produce the [[anemia]] associated with some other [[roundworm]] infections.

==Treatment==
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have traditionally used [[epazote]] (''Chenopodium ambrisioides'') for treatment, which was not as powerful as pharmaceutical compounds, but spontaneous passage of Ascarids provided some proof of efficacy.

Some recent studies exist in the medical literature suggesting that sun-dried [[papaya]] and watermelon seeds may reduce infections by a large factor.  The adult dosage is one tablespoon of the seed powder in a glass of [[sugar]] water once a week for two weeks.  The sugar makes the bitter taste palatable and acts as a [[laxative]].

Pharmaceutical treatments include:
* [[Mebendazole]] (Vermox) (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>13</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).  Causes slow immobilization and death of the worms by selectively and irreversibly blocking uptake of glucose and other nutrients in susceptible adult intestine where helminths dwell.  Oral dosage is 100 [[milligram|mg]] 12 hourly for 3 days.
* [[Piperazine]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>.C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).  A flaccid paralyzing agent that causes a blocking response of ascaris muscle to acetylcholine.  The narcotizing effect immobilizes the worm, which prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole.  If used by itself it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces.  Dosage is 75 mg/kg (max 3.5 g) as a single oral dose.
* [[Pyrantel pamoate]] (Antiminth, Pin-Rid, Pin-X) (C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S.C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)  Depolarizes ganglionic block of nicotinic neuromuscular transmission, resulting in spastic paralysis of the worm. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular pyrantel pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load.  Dosage is 11 mg/kg  not to exceed 1 g as a single dose.
* [[Albendazole]] (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S)  A broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent that decreases [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production in the worm, causing energy depletion, immobilization, and finally death.  Dosage is 400 mg given as single oral dose (contraindicated during pregnancy and children under 2 years).
* [[Thiabendazole]].  This may cause migration of the worm into the [[esophagus]], so it is usually combined with piperazine.

Also, [[corticosteroids]] can treat some of the symptoms, such as inflammation.

==Prevention==
Prevention includes; use of [[toilet]] facilities; safe excreta disposal; protection of food from dirt and soil; thorough washing of produce; hand washing; and common-sense sanitary measures. 

Food dropped on the floor should never be eaten without washing or cooking, particularly in endemic areas.  Vegetables originating from third-world countries should always be washed thoroughly before consumption.

==Animal models for Ascaris infestation==

There are two animal models for studying Ascaris infection:
* Mouse-''[[Ascaris suum]]'' test model. (Howes HL Jr. J Parasitol. 1971 Jun; 57(3): 487-93.)
* ''Ascaris suum'' in experimentally infected pigs. (Lichtensteiger CA et al; 1999)

==Trivia==
*Ascariasis may result in [[allergy|allergies]] to [[shrimp]] and [[dustmite]]s due to the  shared [[antigen]], [[tropomyosin]].
*Worm infestation, including ascaris lumbricoides, may provide some protection against developing [[asthma]].
*Ascaris have an aversion to some general anesthetics and may exit the body, sometimes through the mouth. [http://arpa.allenpress.com/arpaonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1043%2F0003-9985(2000)124%3C0174:AL%3E2.0.CO%3B2]
