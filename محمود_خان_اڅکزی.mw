Pakhtoon nationalist leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who is also chairman of the Pakhtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was born in 1948. His father, Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, was himself a famous Pakhtoon nationalist leader who remained behind the bars for almost three decades before being eventually killed in a mysterious bomb blast in the 1970s. The young Achakzai did his BSc in Engineering in 1971 from University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar. A staunch nationalist and democrat, he is widely respected among progressive circles for his principled stance on human rights and rule of law.

Mahmood Khan Achakzai has been elected as a member of the National Assembly (MNA) several times from his home constituency of Qilla Abdullah-Quetta since 1974. In fact, he was the only Pakhtoon nationalist to be elected as an MNA in the 2002 general elections, which were swept by the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA). Achakzai is not viewed favourably by many people in Pakistan, because he demands rights of Pakhtoons and wants provincial control over resources, such as water, oil, gas, electricity, etc. He has three sons and two daughters, and his major hobby is reading books. The News on Sunday interviewed him recently. Excerpts follow:

The News on Sunday: What kind of Pakistan the Pakhtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party wants to see?

Mahmood Khan Achakzai: The Pakhtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party believes that Pakistan is a multi-nation state consisting of the historic motherlands of Punjabis, Sindhis, Pakhtoons, Balochs and Seraikis, who should live in harmony with each other. The parliament must be sovereign, and that military and secret agencies must have no role in state affairs. Here, no one must be a ruler or ruled. However, unfortunately since 1947, we have never seen true democracy in Pakistan. From Quaid-e-Azam to Asif Ali Zardari, no one has got the absolute power that we expect in a democratic country. Since the birth of Pakistan, Punjabi civil and military bureaucracies started their programme to run this country according to their own wishes. The country remained without a constitution for nine years. Then came the first constitution, followed by the second and the third, but we could not see real democracy in Pakistan. So, if we look at the political and constitutional history of Pakistan, we shall come to the conclusion that military and civil bureaucracies, with the help of judiciary, only want to create Punjab's hegemony in the country. After the 1956 Constitution, they compelled Bengalis to surrender to the Punjabi supremacy. When they realised that democratic forces would obstruct them, they imposed the first martial law that ultimately resulted in the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.

TNS: What should be the role of the army and secret agencies?

MKA: As I said earlier, it was just the behaviour of military and civil bureaucracies that resulted in the country's dismemberment. But even after this, they did not learn from their mistakes and imposed two more martial laws. After the imposition of the last martial law in 1999, they reached the peak of their strategic aim with the creation of the National Security Council. They held the general elections in 2002 under the army's shadow. As a result, a non-representative parliament came into being. And now Pakistan is totally hollow. It has nothing to present to its citizens or to the world. As Pakhtoons, we are not against the army or secret agencies. We want to see the Pakistan Army as one of the strongest armies in the world. However, whether it wants or not, the army must realise that it will have to stop involvement in politics. Especially people in the army from Punjab must realise the importance of this issue for the survival of the country. We are part of Pakistan and the Pakistan Army, but we want to strengthen the latter only as an army and not rulers.

TNS: Who in Pakistan should decide about war or peace?

MKA: A truly elected parliament must be given complete sovereignty, and the army and secret agencies must be made subservient to it. The decisions about peace or war should be made by the parliament and not by the army. Unfortunately, we have never seen genuine democracy in Pakistan. Genuine powers have never been transferred to the truly elected leaders of the people. If any power has ever been transferred, that too has been at the behest of secret agencies. Unfortunately, our secret agencies only term those leaders genuine who are with them and act upon their directives, while those leaders who are against their role in politics are declared as traitors and unpatriotic. And the result is that Pakistan is passing through the worst-ever crisis of its history.

TNS: What kind of democracy does your party envisions for Pakistan?

MKA: Our party wants a truly democratic Pakistan and a fully sovereign parliament. We want one vote for one person; equality among different ethnic nations living in the country; creation of federating units on the basis of language and geography; and a true federation in which at the most three or four departments are with the federation and the remaining with the provinces. But our elders were imprisoned for up to 14 years for demanding the same.

TNS: Should all Pakhtoon areas of Pakistan be made one province?

MKA: Yes, of course. Why not? If we look at the map of the world, we shall see that the contiguous Pakhtoon belt is divided into four administrative parts. My question is why? We want all Pakhtoon areas of Pakistan -- whether they are in the NWFP, Balochistan or Punjab (Attock and Mianwali districts) -- to be made one province. We believe that the Northern Areas, such as Chitral, Gilgit and Baltistan, are also part of Pakhtoonkhwa. If this is not possible, at least the Pakhtoon areas of Balochistan should be made a separate province. As far as the inclusion of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is concerned, the people there should be asked whether they want to join Pakhtoonkhwa or not. If they want to join it, they are most welcome; if not, we are happy with their separate status. We are not against any identity nor do we want to occupy any land. We are not oppressors. We just want to have one province for Pakhtoons. We pray to God that Balochs may also get their own province.

TNS: How can you justify that Pakhtoons were different from Balochs?

MKA: If we speak from history, from River Oxus to River Indus was actual Afghanistan, while Kashmir and Punjab up to Dhaka were colonies of Pakhtoons. This means that, from Kabul to Dhaka, everything was in the control of Pakhtoons and Ahmed Shah Abdali was their leader. In 1803, when the British Raj tried to develop diplomatic contacts with Afghans, the then British envoy came through Multan and presented his documents to Abdali at Peshawar's Balahisar Fort. Peshawar was the British Empire's winter capital at that time, while Kabul was the summer capital. After Abdali's death, Ranjeet Singh, who was the governor of Punjab during Abdali's rule, with the help of some other forces, captured the today's NWFP and this area came under Lahore's control. Afghans kept on fighting against British forces until 1883, when the Raj drew the Durand Line and divided Pakhtoons into four parts -- Afghanistan, the NWFP, FATA and the Pakhtoon belt of Balochistan. In 1879, the Gandamuk Treaty was signed between British forces and Yaqoob Khan, the jailed prince of Kabul. According to this treaty, the Pakhtoon areas of Afghanistan were to be ruled by Yaqoob; FATA was to be under no one's control; the NWFP was declared part of Punjab; and for Pakhtoons of southern areas and four Baloch tribes -- Chaghi, Jamali, Murree and Bugti -- a new province named British Balochistan was established on November 1, 1887. The new province was to be ruled directly by the British monarch through agent to the governor general and with the help of a Shahi Jirga of 62 members. Of these, only eight were elected members from Quetta, while seven were Baloch members and the remaining Pakhtoon elders. Before this, Baloch tribes were under a Pakhtoon monarch and had their own identity. The Khan of Qalat was not a sovereign ruler, because he was under the command of a Pakhtoon monarch. His duty was only to provide safe passage to traders up to Qandahar and, in return, the Pakhtoon monarch assured protection from foreign invaders to him. Baloch areas, such as Qalat, Lesbella, Makran, Kharan and Jal Magsi, were independent states and had nothing to do with British Balochistan.

TNS: There are also talks of greater Pakhtoonistan in some sections of the society. Is there any truth in them?

MKA: Actually this debate started from the billboards installed in different parts of Pakistan, in which the Afghan government has asked its citizens to come back to their homeland. The words "Lar aw bar Pakhtoon yo day" (upper and lower Pakhtoons are one) were criticised. We also say that all Pakhtoons are one, but we have never said anything about greater Pakhtoonistan. We say that all Afghans and Pakhtoons are one, but they are like two brothers living in different homes. So these are only rumours and there is no truth in them.

TNS: What are your views about provincial autonomy in Pakistan?

MKA: To be fair, provincial autonomy is not the solution to the problems of Pakistan. Actually Pakistan needs re-structuring. Their must be five provinces on the basis of language and geography in Pakistan. Two things are of utmost important for Pakistan -- the issue of nationalism and economy -- and they need urgent attention. We have seen that Russia was the second most powerful state on the globe, but it vanished just because it did not pay heed to these two things. In the 1970 elections, people voted for two things: nationalism and economy. Pakhtoons, Balochs and Bengalis voted in favour of nationalism, while Punjab and Sindh voted for economy (roti, kapra aur makan). As a result, Pakistan had the worst-ever experience of its history when Bangladesh came into being. And the reason was just that these two issues were not addressed. It was the duty of the leaders and thinkers of that time to give importance to these issues, but unfortunately they did not. Moreover, the Pakistan Army will have to stop its involvement in politics. Basic education must be imparted to all citizens in their mother tongue and there must be equality among all the federating units. In a nutshell, I would say that four ministries -- finance, foreign affairs, communication and defence -- must be with the federation and all remaining ones with federating units. Finally, the appointment of chief justice, chiefs of armed forces, chief election commissioner, auditor general, federal ombudsman, ambassadors, and chairpersons of corporations, banks and other institutions must be approved by the Senate.

TNS: Who should collect revenues: the federation or the provinces?

MKA: Finance is of utmost importance and it must be with federating units and not the federation. I have already said that the provinces should have control over their resources and no one else should snatch them. Whether it is water, forests, gas or any other natural resource, the provinces should have the right to use them according to the will of their people.

TNS: The Pakhtoons in Karachi are facing many problems these days. Can you explain why?

MKA: I would say that Karachi is part of Sindh and its owners are Sindhis. However, Pakhtoons are not claiming its ownership; they are only claiming their right to livelihood there as citizens of Pakistan. They are playing their part in the development of Karachi. They want to live in peace, but some people are trying to sabotage the peace of Karachi for their vested interests. For example, on May 12, 2007, Shahrah-e-Faisal was blocked and 45 innocent people were killed in broad daylight. My question is why? Is the blood of Pakhtoons cheaper than that of others? I don't want to say blame either the MQM or the ANP, but who then are the terrorists? At that time, a dictator was in power, but it is strange that the case has not yet been investigated despite the fact that now there is a democratic government in the country. It is the duty of the army, the judiciary, the Sindh government and the federal government to look into the matter and find out who were responsible for it; otherwise, the results will be dangerous not only for Karachi but for the whole country.

TNS: During the previous regime, there were talks of breaking up Punjab into three smaller provinces. What do you have to say in this regard?

MKA: It was Dr Sher Afghan Niazi who initiated this discussion, but I am not in favour of breaking up any province. However, I must say that there must a separate province for Seraikis.

TNS: The people of Hazara division are not in favour of renaming the NWFP as Pakhtoonkhwa. What are your comments?

MKA: I think it is not a big issue. They are our brothers and we can talk to them. We want to have one province extending from Chitral, Gilgit and Baltistan up to Chaman. Everyone knows that the people of this belt speak many languages, but this does not means that they are not part of our land. You can see that people speak Hindko in Kohat and Peshawar, and Seraiki in Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan, but are they not our part? They are our brothers and it is the duty of every Pashto speaker to assure them that they are safe and have every right.

TNS: There is an ongoing war in the Pakhtoon belt (FATA and Swat) and dozens of people are dying daily. What are your views on this?

MKA: The basic question is that why this war started? We will have to respect other's sovereignty and stop interfering in their affairs if we want peace in our country. Every person is the owner of his or her home and no one else has the right to interfere in his or her affairs. Four years ago, Pakistan faced four accusations: 1) The country's nuclear arsenal is in unsafe hands and it has been sold to other countries; 2) It is a safe place for international terrorists; 3) There is no democracy in the country, and the army and intelligence agencies run it; and 4) It is interfering in the affairs of other countries. The nuclear arsenal of no other country except Pakistan is discussed. Why these double standards?

TNS: Should the army be withdrawn from FATA and Swat?

MKA: I think this question must be asked from the people of FATA. There must be elected jirgas of every tribal area, just like district councils of settled areas of Pakistan, which should decide this question. The political agent must also be subservient to this jirga. If we look into history, every invader from Alexander the Great until now has tried to capture this land, but we have always successfully defended our homeland. We are not terrorists, but we know how to defend our own homeland. And if defending motherland is terrorism, then we are proud of this terrorism.

TNS: You boycotted the last general elections to show solidarity with lawyers. Do you think that the move was right?

MKA: I am all for an independent judiciary in Pakistan and the lawyers' movement is one the greatest movements in the history of the country. However, I must make it clear that we did not boycott the elections only because of the lawyers' movement. We boycotted the elections because of the APDM's London Declaration, which said that none of the parties in the coalition would take part in the elections under a dictator.
