'''محمود خان اڅکزی''' (زېږېدنه: ۱۹۴۸ ز. - ) (په انګرېزي:''Mahmood Khan Achakzai'') د پښتونخوا ملي عوامي ګوند مشر او د عبدالصمد خان اڅکزي ځوی دی. نوموړی يو ملتپاله او ډېموکراټ سياسي مبارز دی. محمود خان اڅکزی څو څو واره د پاکستان د ولسي جرګې يا نېشنل اسېمبلۍ غړی پاتې شوی. په ۲۰۰۲ ز. کال کې هغه يوازينی ملتپاله سياستپوه وه چې د ټولټاکنو له لارې يې د پاکستان د ولسي جرګې د غړيتوب لپاره وټاکل شو. په پاکستان کې اڅکزی يو ناندريز شخصيت دی چې د نوموړي د سياسي ګروهو له کبله يې ډېر سيال سياستوال او ګوندونه نه خوښوي. د دې سبب دا دی چې محمود خان اڅکزی په سيمه ايزه کچه د پښتنو د حقونو غږ پورته کړی او د پښتنو په سيمو کې د هغوی په طبيعي منابعو باندې د پښتنو د واک خبره يې رابرسېره کړې. نوموړی په کوټه کې په خپل پلرني ټاټوبي کې اوسېږي.

{{ژباړل}}His father, Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, was himself a famous Pakhtoon nationalist leader who remained behind the bars for almost three decades before being eventually killed in a mysterious bomb blast in the 1970s.

. The young Achakzai did his BSc in Engineering in 1971 from University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar. A staunch nationalist and democrat, he is widely respected among progressive circles for his principled stance on human rights and rule of law.

== سياست ==
Mahmood Khan Achakzai has been elected as a member of the National Assembly (MNA) several times from his home constituency of Qilla Abdullah-Quetta since 1974. In fact, he was the only Pakhtoon nationalist to be elected as an MNA in the 2002 general elections, which were swept by the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA). Achakzai is not viewed favourably by many people in Pakistan, because he demands rights of Pakhtoons and wants provincial control over resources, such as water, oil, gas, electricity, etc. He has three sons and two daughters, and his major hobby is reading books. 

Mahmood Khan Achakzai: The Pakhtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party believes that Pakistan is a multi-nation state consisting of the historic motherlands of Punjabis, Sindhis, Pakhtoons, Balochs and Seraikis, who should live in harmony with each other. The parliament must be sovereign, and that military and secret agencies must have no role in state affairs. Here, no one must be a ruler or ruled. However, unfortunately since 1947, we have never seen true democracy in Pakistan. From Quaid-e-Azam to Asif Ali Zardari, no one has got the absolute power that we expect in a democratic country. Since the birth of Pakistan, Punjabi civil and military bureaucracies started their programme to run this country according to their own wishes. The country remained without a constitution for nine years. Then came the first constitution, followed by the second and the third, but we could not see real democracy in Pakistan. So, if we look at the political and constitutional history of Pakistan, we shall come to the conclusion that military and civil bureaucracies, with the help of judiciary, only want to create Punjab's hegemony in the country. After the 1956 Constitution, they compelled Bengalis to surrender to the Punjabi supremacy. When they realised that democratic forces would obstruct them, they imposed the first martial law that ultimately resulted in the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.

MKA: Our party wants a truly democratic Pakistan and a fully sovereign parliament. We want one vote for one person; equality among different ethnic nations living in the country; creation of federating units on the basis of language and geography; and a true federation in which at the most three or four departments are with the federation and the remaining with the provinces. But our elders were imprisoned for up to 14 years for demanding the same.

TNS: Should all Pakhtoon areas of Pakistan be made one province?

MKA: Yes, of course. Why not? If we look at the map of the world, we shall see that the contiguous Pakhtoon belt is divided into four administrative parts. My question is why? We want all Pakhtoon areas of Pakistan -- whether they are in the NWFP, Balochistan or Punjab (Attock and Mianwali districts) -- to be made one province. We believe that the Northern Areas, such as Chitral, Gilgit and Baltistan, are also part of Pakhtoonkhwa. If this is not possible, at least the Pakhtoon areas of Balochistan should be made a separate province. As far as the inclusion of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is concerned, the people there should be asked whether they want to join Pakhtoonkhwa or not. If they want to join it, they are most welcome; if not, we are happy with their separate status. We are not against any identity nor do we want to occupy any land. We are not oppressors. We just want to have one province for Pakhtoons. We pray to God that Balochs may also get their own province.

TNS: There are also talks of greater Pakhtoonistan in some sections of the society. Is there any truth in them?

MKA: Actually this debate started from the billboards installed in different parts of Pakistan, in which the Afghan government has asked its citizens to come back to their homeland. The words "Lar aw bar Pakhtoon yo day" (upper and lower Pakhtoons are one) were criticised. We also say that all Pakhtoons are one, but we have never said anything about greater Pakhtoonistan. We say that all Afghans and Pakhtoons are one, but they are like two brothers living in different homes. So these are only rumours and there is no truth in them.
