'''سربيا''', officially the '''د سربيا جمهوريت''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: ''Република Србија'', [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]: ''Republika Srbija'', {{Audio|Republika Srbija.ogg|listen}}), is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Balkans|Southeastern]] [[Europe]], covering the central part of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] and the southern part of the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The capital is [[Belgrade]]. Serbia borders [[هنګري]] to the north; [[رومانيا]] او [[بلغاريه/بلغارستان]] to the east; the [[مقدونيه]] to the south; او [[مانټېنېګرو]], [[کروآسيا]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to the west.

Placed under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation in the 15th century, the [[First Serbian Uprising|uprisings]] against Turkish yoke between [[1804]]-[[1815]] reestablished Serbia as a state which obtained formal independence in [[1878]]. Victorious in [[Balkan wars]] and [[World War I]], for nearly a century Serbia was part of various [[Yugoslavia|South Slavic states]], including the Kingdom of the [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]] from [[1918]] to [[1941]] (re-named the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in [[1929]]), the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from [[1945]] to [[1992]], the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from [[1992]] to [[2003]], and the State Union [[Serbia and Montenegro]] from [[2003]] to [[2006]]. After Montenegro voted to leave the State Union, Serbia officially proclaimed its independence on [[June 5]], [[2006]], as the [[successor state]] to the State Union Serbia and Montenegro. 

== جغرافيه ==
{{main|د سربيا جغرافيه}}
Serbia is located in the [[Balkans]] (a historically and geographically distinct region of southeastern [[Europe]]) and in the [[Pannonian Plain]] (a region of central Europe). It shares borders with [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Romania]]. Serbia is [[landlocked]], although the [[Danube River]] provides shipping access to inland Europe and the [[Black Sea]].

Serbia's terrain ranges from the rich, fertile plains of the northern [[Vojvodina]] region, limestone ranges and basins in the east, and, in the southeast, ancient mountains and hills. The north is dominated by the Danube River. A tributary, the Morava River, flows through the more mountainous southern regions.

=== Climate ===
The Serbian [[climate]] varies between a continental climate in the north, with cold winters, and hot, humid summers with well distributed rainfall patterns, and a more Adriatic climate in the south with hot, dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy inland snowfall.

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د سربيا تاريخ}}
{{see also|List of Serbian monarchs|History of Yugoslavia|}}

=== Medieval Serbia ===
[[دوتنه:CarDusan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tsar]] [[Stefan Dušan|Stefan Dušan the Great]] of the [[Serbian Empire]].]] The roots of the Serbian state date back to the [[7th century]] and the [[House of Vlastimirović]]. A Serbian kingdom (centered around [[Duklja]]) was established in the [[11th century]]. It lasted until the end of the 12th century.

The medieval Serbian state was re-formed in the [[Raška (state)|Raška]] region in the 12th century by the Serbian [[Župan|Grand Župan]] [[Stefan Nemanja]]. In [[1220]], under [[Stefan the First Crowned]], Serbia became a kingdom, and in [[1346]], [[Stefan Dušan]] established the [[Serbian Empire]]. The Empire was disintegrated and fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] after the historic [[Battle of Kosovo]] in [[1389]]. The northern Serbian territories (the [[Serbian Despotate]]) were totally conquered in [[1459]] when [[Smederevo]] fell. [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] fell a few years after Smederevo, and [[Herzegovina]] in [[1482]].

=== Ottoman Serbia ===
Following the collapse of [[Serbian Empire]] in [[Battle of Kosovo]], between [[1459]] and [[1804]], Serbia was under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, despite three [[Austria]]n invasions and numerous rebellions (such as the [[Banat Uprising]]). [[Islam]] was in a period of expansion during this time, especially in [[Raska]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Bosnia]]. Many [[Serbs]] (and [[Croats]]) converted to Islam, which eventually led to the forming of the [[Bosniak]] nation. The Ottoman period was a defining one in the history of the country; Slavic, Byzantine, Arabic and Turkish cultures suffused. Many contemporary cultural traits can be traced back to Ottoman period.

=== Modern Serbia ===
''Main article: [[History of Modern Serbia]]
[[دوتنه:Serbia02.png|200px|thumb|right|Austrian and Ottoman Serbia in 1849]]
The [[First Serbian Uprising]] of [[1804]]-[[1813]], led by [[Đorđe Petrović]] (also known as ''Karađorđe'' or "Black George"), and the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] of [[1815]] resulted in the establishment of the [[Principality of Serbia]].  As it was semi-independent from the Ottoman Empire, it is considered to be the precursor of the formation of [[History of Modern Serbia|modern Serbia]]. 

From [[1815]] to [[1903]], the Serbian state was ruled by the [[House of Obrenović]], except from [[1842]] to [[1858]], when Serbia was ruled by Prince [[Aleksandar Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]]. In 1903, the House of Obrenović was replaced by the [[House of Karađorđević]], who were descendants of Đorđe Petrović.

In the northern part of present-day Serbia that was ruled by the [[Austrian Empire]], the local Serbs created in 1848 their autonomous region known as the [[Serbian Vojvodina]]. The region was in 1849 transformed into new Austrian crownland known as the [[Vojvodina of Serbia and Tamiš Banat]]. Although, the crownland was abolished in 1860, the Serbs from the Vojvodina region gained another oportunity to achieve their political demands in 1918.  

The struggle for a modern society, human rights and a nation-state in Serbia lasted almost three decades and was completed with the adoption of the constitution on 15th February 1835. In 1876, [[Montenegro]], Serbia, and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] declared war against the Ottoman Empire and proclaimed their unification. However, the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin of 1878]], which was signed at the [[Congress of Berlin]] by the [[Great Powers]], granted complete independence only to Serbia and Montenegro, leaving Bosnia and [[Raška (region)|Raška]] to [[Austria-Hungary]], who blocked their unification until the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912 and 1913 and [[WWI]].

[[دوتنه:Karađorđe Petrović, by Vladimir Borovikovsky, 1816.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Karađorđe Petrović]], leader of the [[First Serbian uprising]] in 1804.]]
On [[28 June]] [[1914]] the [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] at [[Sarajevo]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a South Slav unionist, Austrian subject and member of [[Young Bosnia]], led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia. The [[Russian Empire]] started to mobilise its troops in defence of its ally Serbia, which resulted in the [[German Empire]] declaring war on Russia in support of its ally Austria-Hungary. However, as German military planners [[Schlieffen Plan#The Schlieffen Plan In Action.2C And Its Failure|wished to avoid a war on two fronts]] against both Russia and [[French Third Republic|France]], they attacked France first. This eventually culminated in all the major [[European Powers]] being drawn into the war. The Serbian Army won several major victories against Austria-Hungary during [[World War I]], but it was finally overpowered by the joint forces of the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria. In World War I, Serbia had 1,264,000 casualties — 28% of its total population, and 58% of its male population.{{fact}}

{{د سربيا تاريخ}}

=== Between the wars ===
After 1918, Serbia, along with [[Montenegro]], was a founding member of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later known as the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. During [[World War II]], Serbia was a German-occupied puppet state that included present-day Central Serbia and Banat, popularly called [[Nedić's Serbia]]. However, parts of the present-day territory of Serbia were occupied by Croatian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Albanian, and Italian armies. The occupying powers committed numerous crimes against the civilian population, especially against Serbs and Jews.{{fact}}

=== Post WWII ===
In 1945, Serbia was established as one of the federal units of the [[SFRJ|second Yugoslavia]], the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, led by [[Josip Broz Tito]] until his death in 1980.

After the collapse of the second Yugoslavia in 1992 until the year [[2003]], Serbia, together with Montenegro, was part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Despite civil wars in neighbouring [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Serbia remained peaceful until 1998, when the clashes with K.L.A. started in Kosovo.

Between 1998 and 1999, continued clashes in Kosovo between Serbian and Yugoslav security forces and the [[K.L.A.]] prompted a [[Operation Allied Force|NATO aerial bombardment]] which lasted for 78 days. The attacks were stopped when Yugoslav president [[Slobodan Milošević]] agreed to remove all security forces, including the military and the police, and have them replaced by a body of international police, in return for which Kosovo would formally remain within the Yugoslav Federation (See: [[Kosovo War]]).

In September 2000, opposition parties claimed that Milosevic committed fraud in routine federal elections.  Street protests and rallies throughout Serbia eventually forced Milosevic to concede and hand over power to the recently formed Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a broad coalition of anti-Milosevic parties.  

The fall of Milosevic led to end of the international isolation Serbia suffered during the Milosevic years.  Serbia's new democratic leaders announced that Serbia would seek to join the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In October 2005, the EU opened negotiations with Serbia for a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA), a preliminary step towards joining the EU. 

From 2003 to 2006, Serbia was part of the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]], into which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had been transformed. On [[May 21]], [[2006]], Montenegro held a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]] to determine whether or not to end the union with Serbia. The next day, state-certified results showed 55.5% of voters in favor of independence, which was just above the 55% required by the referendum. On [[June 3]], the [[Parliament of Montenegro]] declared [[Montenegro]] independent of the State Union and on [[June 5]], the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] declared Serbia the successor to the State Union.

[[دوتنه:TadicBoris.PNG|thumb|left|[[Boris Tadić]], President of Serbia]]
On [[4 February]] [[2003]] the [[Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro|parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] agreed to a weaker form of cooperation between Serbia and [[Montenegro]] within a [[commonwealth]] called [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The union ceased to exist following [[Montenegrin]] and Serbian declarations of independence in June 2006.

After the ousting of [[Slobodan Milošević]] on [[5 October]] [[2000]], the country was governed by the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]]. 
Tensions gradually increased within the coalition until the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]] (DSS) left the government, leaving the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS) in overall control. Nevertheless, in March [[2004]] the DSS gathered enough support to form the new [[Government of Serbia]], together with [[G17 Plus]] and coalition [[Serbian Renewal Movement|SPO]]-[[New Serbia|NS]], and the support of the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]], who do not take part in the government, but in exchange for the support hold minor government and justice positions and influence policies. The [[Prime Minister of Serbia]] is [[Vojislav Koštunica]], leader of the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]].

The current [[President of Serbia]] is [[Boris Tadić]], leader of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS). He was elected with 53% of the vote in the second round of the [[Serbian presidential election, 2004|Serbian presidential election]] held on [[27 June]] [[2004]], following several unsuccessful elections since [[2002]].

{{main|Subdivisions of Serbia}}
{{see also|Regions of Serbia|Districts of Serbia|Municipalities of Serbia|}}
[[دوتنه:Districts_and_Municipalities_of_Serbia.png|thumb|150px|right|Political map of Serbia]]
Serbia is divided into 29 districts (5 of which are in [[Kosovo]], currently [[United Nations|UN]]-administered) and the [[City of Belgrade]]. The districts are further divided into 108 municipalities. Serbia two autonomous provinces: [[Kosovo and Metohija]] in the south (30 municipalities), which is presently under the administration of the [[UNMIK|United Nations]], and [[Vojvodina]] in the north (46 municipalities). 

The part of Serbia that is neither in Kosovo nor in Vojvodina is called [[Central Serbia]]. Central Serbia is not an administrative division (unlike the two autonomous provinces), and it has no regional government of its own. In [[English language|English]] this region is often called "[[Serbia proper]]" to denote "the part of the Republic of Serbia not including the provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo", as the [[Library of Congress]] puts it [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yugoslavia/yu_glos.html]. This usage was also employed in [[Serbo-Croatian]] during the Yugoslav era (in the form of "uža Srbija" literally: narrower Serbia). Its use in English is purely geographical without any particular political meaning being implied.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Serbia}}
{{see also|Demographic history of Serbia|Demographic history of Vojvodina|Demographic history of Kosovo|Ethnic groups of Vojvodina}}


Serbia is populated mostly by [[Serbs]]. Significant [[minority|minorities]] include [[Albanians]] (who are a majority in the province of [[Kosovo-Metohia]]), [[Magyars|Hungarians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Roma (people)|Roma]], [[Croats]], [[Slovaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Romanians]], etc. Serbia consists of three territories: the province of [[Kosovo and Metohia]], the province of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Central Serbia]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: Централна Србија, [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]: Centralna Srbija, [[English language|English]]: Central Serbia. Note: The English language sometimes uses the varieties such are "Serbia proper" or "Narrower Serbia"). The two provinces are ethnically diverse, which originates in the fact, that the country has been organised from parts ruled by the former [[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] in the south and parts ruled by the former [[Catholic]] [[Habsburg Empire]] in the north. 

The northern province of [[Vojvodina]] is the most developed part of the country in terms of economic strength. Together with the [[Former Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav republics]] of [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Vojvodina was under the administration of [[Austria-Hungary]] before the First World War. Vojvodina is one of the most ethnically diverse territories in Europe, with more than 25 different national communities. According to the last completed census ([[2002]]), the province has a population of about 2 million, of which: [[Serbs]] 65%, [[Magyars|Hungarians]] 14.3%, [[Slovaks]] 2.79%, [[Croats]] 2.78%, undeclared 2.71%, [[Yugoslavs]] 2.45%, [[Montenegrins]] 1.75%, [[Romanians]] 1.50%, [[Roma people|Roma]] 1.43%, [[Bunjevci]] 0.97%, [[Pannonian Rusyns|Ruthenians]] 0.77%, [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] 0.58%, regional affiliation 0.50%, [[Ukrainians]] 0.23%, others ([[Albanians]], [[Slovenians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] etc).

[[دوتنه:Serbian Gusle.jpg|130px|thumb|right|The [[Gusle]], Serbian national music instrument]]
Serbia is one of [[Europe|Europe's]] most culturally diverse countries. The borders between large empires ran through the territory of today's Serbia for long periods in history: between the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]; and between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] (later [[Austria Hungary]]). As a result, while the north is culturally [[Mitteleuropa|Central European]], the south is rather more [[Oriental]]. Of course, both regions have influenced each other, and so the distinction between north and south is artificial to some extent.

The [[Byzantine Empire]]'s influence on Serbia was perhaps the greatest. Serbs are [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]], not [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], with their own national church - the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. They use both the [[Cyrillic]] and [[Latin]] alphabets, as a result of both Eastern and Western influences. The [[List of Serb Orthodox monasteries|monasteries of Serbia]], built largely in the [[Middle Ages]], are one of the most valuable and visible traces of [[History of Medieval Serbia|medieval Serbia's]] association with the Byzantium, but also with the Romanic (Western) Europe that Serbia had close ties with back in middle ages.

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Serbia}}

Education in Serbia is regulated by the [[Serbian Ministry of Education and Sports]].

Education starts in either pre-schools or elementary schools. Children enroll in elementary schools ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Osnovna škola'') at age of 7 and it lasts for eight years.

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Serbia}}
Tourism in Serbia is mostly based in mountains and villages. The most famous mountain resorts are [[Zlatibor]], [[Kopaonik]], and the [[Tara Mountain|Tara]]. There also are a lot of spas in Serbia, one the biggest of which is the [[Vrnjačka Banja]]. There is also significant tourism in [[Belgrade]] and [[Novi Sad]] (the capital of the [[Vojvodina]] province), as well to the [[EXIT (festival)|Exit Festival]] and the [[Guča|Guča trumpet festival]].

Serbia, in particular the valley of the [[Morava]], is often described as "the crossroads between East and West", which is one of the primary reasons for its turbulent history.  The Morava valley route, which avoids mountainous regions, is by far the easiest way of travelling overland from continental [[Europe]] to [[Greece]] and [[Asia Minor]].

[[European routes]] E65, E70, E75 and E80, as well as the E662, E761, E762, E763, E771, and E851 pass through the country. The E70 westwards from Belgrade and most of the E75 are modern highways of [[motorway]] / [[autobahn]] standard or close to that.

The [[Danube]] River, [[central Europe]]'s connection to the [[Black Sea]], flows through Serbia.

There are three international airports in Serbia: [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]], [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport]], and [[Priština International Airport]] (last one is located in the Serbian province of [[Kosovo]]). Three regional airports are being reconstruct at the moment, and by the end of 2006, the number of international airports in Serbia will increase.

The national carrier is [[Jat Airways]] and the railway system is operated by [[Beovoz]] in [[Belgrade]] and by [[Serbian Railways]] on the national level.

== Miscellaneous ==
* On [[August 17]] [[2004]] the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] adopted [[Bože Pravde]] as the country's [[national anthem|anthem]].
* In addition, the [[Obrenović]] royal coat of arms now replaces the [[Coat of Arms of Serbia]] adopted after [[World War II]]. It was first used in the [[19th century]]. The arms are those of the royal Obrenović dynasty; they are used in two versions, the large (pictured) and small (just the central shield with eagle and crown surmounting). Use of these arms is 'recommended' which means that the coat of arms is not yet official. It will become so if adoption of the Obrenović arms is approved by more than 50% of the voters in a constitutional referendum.
* [[1564 Srbija]] [[Asteroid]] is discovered by [[Milorad B. Protić]] and named after Serbia.
* Serbia grows about one-third of the world's [[raspberry|raspberries]].{{citation-needed}}
* Serbian industries: machine building (aircraft, trucks, and automobiles; tanks and weapons; electrical equipment; agricultural machinery); metallurgy (steel, aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, chromium, antimony, bismuth, cadmium); mining (coal, bauxite, nonferrous ore, iron ore, limestone); consumer goods (textiles, footwear, foodstuffs, appliances); electronics, petroleum products, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals ([[CIA]] Fact Book 2006)
* As a newly independent state, Serbia will deal with assigment of international [[Serbian country codes|country codes]].
* Serbia and Montenegro were represented by [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|a single football team]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] tournament, despite having formally split just days prior to its start. Following this event, this team is to be inherited by Serbia, while a new one is to be organized to represent Montenegro in future international competition.
