The '''heart''' is a  fist shaped, [[muscle|muscular]] [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] responsible for pumping [[blood]] through the [[blood vessel]]s by repeated, rhythmic contractions, or a similar structure in [[annelid]]s, [[mollusk]]s, and [[arthropod]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=heart | title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of heart'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}.</ref> The term ''cardiac'' (as in [[cardiology]]) means "related to the heart" and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] καρδία, ''kardia'', for "heart." The heart is composed of [[cardiac muscle]], an [[involuntary muscle]] tissue which is found only within this organ.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=cardiac | title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of cardiac'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}</ref>

==Early development==
{{main|Heart development}}
[[Image:EHR-BBII.jpg|thumb|right|300px|At 21 days after [[Fertilization|conception]], the human heart begins beating at 70 to 80 beats per minute and accelerates linearly for the first month of beating.]]The human heart beats more than 2.5 billion times in an average lifetime.
The human embryonic heart begins beating approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy.  The human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother’s, about 75-80 beats per minute (BPM). The embryonic heart rate (EHR) then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165-185 BPM during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 BPM per day, or about 10 BPM every three days, an increase of 100 BPM in the first month.<ref>http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=/us/cotm/0001/ehr2000</ref>

After peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 150 BPM (+/-25 BPM) during the 15th week after the LMP. After the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 BPM) BPM at term. The regression formula which describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25 mm in crown-rump length or 9.2 LMP weeks is:

Age in days = EHR(0.3)+6 

See: [http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=/us/cotm/0001/ehr2000 Embryonic Heart Rates Compared in Assisted and Non-Assisted Pregnancies]

There is no difference in male and female heart rates before birth.<ref>Terry J. DuBose http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/dubose/ehr-age.htm Sex, Heart Rate and Age]</ref>

==Structure==  	 
[[Image:3DScience_Human_Heart.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Anterior (frontal) view of the opened heart. Arrows indicate normal blood flow. Image provided courtesy of www.3dscience.com.]]

In the human body, the heart is usually situated to the left of the middle of the [[thorax]], underneath the [[breastbone]] (see [http://www.easyrashi.com/TEFILLIN/Position_of_heart.htm diagrams]). The heart is usually felt to be on the left side because the [[left heart]] (left ventricle) is stronger (it pumps to all body parts). The left lung is smaller than the right lung because the heart occupies more of the left hemithorax. The heart is enclosed by a sac known as the [[pericardium]] and is surrounded by the [[lung]]s. The pericardium is a double membrane structure containing a [[serous]] fluid to reduce friction during heart contractions. The [[mediastinum]], a subdivision of the thoracic cavity, is the name of the heart cavity. 

The ''apex'' is the blunt point situated in an inferior (pointing down and left) direction. A stethoscope can be placed directly over the apex so that the beats can be counted. It is located posterior to the 5th intercostal space in the left mid-clavicular line. In normal adults, the mass of the heart is 250-350 [[gram|g]] (9-12 oz), or about three fourths the size of a clenched fist, but extremely diseased hearts can be up to 1000 g (2 lb) in mass due to [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]. It consists of four chambers, the two upper ''atria'' (singular: atrium
) and the two lower ''ventricles''.  On the left is a picture of a fresh human heart which was removed from a 64-year-old British male.  

[[Image:Humhrt2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Human heart]]

The function of the right side of the heart (see [[right heart]]) is to collect de-oxygenated blood, in the [[right atrium]], from the body and pump it, via the [[right ventricle]], into the lungs ([[pulmonary circulation]]) so that carbon dioxide can be dropped off and oxygen picked up ([[gas exchange]]). This happens through a passive process called [[diffusion]]. The left side (see [[left heart]]) collects oxygenated blood from the [[lung]]s into the [[left atrium]].  From the left atrium the blood moves to the [[left ventricle]] which pumps it out to the body.  On both sides, the lower ventricles are thicker and stronger than the upper atria.
The muscle wall surrounding the left ventricle is thicker than the wall surrounding the right ventricle due to the higher force needed to pump the blood through the [[systemic circulation]].

The blood flows through a system, starting in the right atrium, the blood flows to the tricuspid valve, then to the right ventricles that pump blood out, to the pulmonary semilunar valve [psv], and on to the pulmonary [[artery]] which delivers blood to the lungs. From there, blood flows back to the pulmonary [[vein]] to the left atrium, then the bicuspid valve, and to the left ventricle, then on to the aortic semilunar valve. Then the blood "forks off" and is delivered to the rest of the body through the aorta, then the arteries, to the arterioles, and to capillaries where they go back to the heart to the venules, to the veins, to the inferior/superior vena cava, and starts all over again.

The heart is effectively a [[syncytium]], a meshwork of cardiac muscle cells interconnected by contiguous cytoplasmic bridges. This relates to electrical stimulation of one cell spreading to neighboring cells.

==First aid==
''See [[cardiac arrest]] for emergencies involving the heart''

If a person is encountered in cardiac arrest (no heartbeat), [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) should be started, and [[call for help|help called]]. If an [[automated external defibrillator]] is available, this device may automatically administer [[defibrillation]] if this is indicated. Usually, if there is enough time, the victim can be rushed to the hospital where he or she will be cared for by a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in the heart and lungs.

==Food use==
The hearts of [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[chicken]]s and certain [[fowl]] are consumed as in many countries. They are counted among [[offal]], but being a muscle, the taste of heart is like regular meat. It resembles [[venison]] in structure and taste.

==As a symbol==
{{details|Heart (symbol)}}
The heart was historically seen by some as the seat of the soul and the organ responsible for human thought. The Romans for example noticed that emotions often corresponded with changing heart rates such as fear, love and excitement. It is now known that the heart has nothing to do with thought or love, people still carry on using the term "heart" metaphorically when talking about love. When used in this metaphorical sense, the heart is often illustrated as an [[icon]] (<font size=4 color="red">♥</font>). 

The term "heart" can also refer to the core or center of anything e.g. "The heart of the matter".

The ancient [[Aztec]] civilization used the heart as a sacrificial token during the sacrifice of a human being. The priest used a stone knife to cut into the thoracic cavity and remove the heart, upon which it would be placed on a stone altar as an offering to the gods. The greatest sacrifice under the reign of Montezuma involved the removal of the hearts of over 12,000 enemy soldiers. 

There has been some recent research on the Cellular memory of the heart, particularly with heart transplant patients.<ref>Sylvia, Claire (1997). A Change of Heart. New York, New York: Little, Brown and Company. ISBN 0-316-82149-7.</ref><ref>Pearsall, Doctor Paul; et alii (1999). The Heart's Code. New York, New York: Broadway Books. ISBN 0-7679-9942-8.</ref>
This study shows how the heart contains thinking and memory skills, interacting heavily with the brain. This, though, is not widely accepted by the scientific community.
