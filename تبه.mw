'''تبه''' (ته په طبي اصطلاح '''pyrexia'''، يا '''febrile ځواب''' وايي، دا ويي د لاطيني لغت [[febris]] نه چې په مانه د تبې ده راوتلی، په لرغوني پېر کې د '''ague''' يا آګو په نامه پېژندل کېده) يوه عامه طبي نښه ده چې د بدن داخلي تودوخه څرګندوي a frequent [[medicine|medical]] [[symptom]] that describes an increase in internal [[body temperature]] to levels that are above normal (37°C, 98.6°F). Fever is most accurately characterized as a temporary elevation in the body’s thermoregulatory set-point, which is usually by about 1-2°C. Fever differs from [[hyperthermia]], which is an increase in body temperature over the body’s thermoregulatory set-point (due to excessive heat production or insufficient [[thermoregulation]], or both). In hospitals fever is daily recorded with fever charts.

The elevation in thermoregulatory set-point means that the previous "normal body temperature" is considered [[hypothermia|hypothermic]], and effector mechanisms kick in. The person who is developing the fever has a cold sensation, and an increase in [[heart rate]], [[muscle tone]] and [[shivering]] attempt to counteract the perceived hypothermia, thereby reaching the new thermoregulatory set-point.

==مېچنه==
When a patient has or is suspected of having a fever, that person's body temperature is measured using a [[medical thermometer|thermometer]]. At a first glance, fever is present if: 
* [[rectum|rectal]] temperature (in the anus) is at, or higher than 38 degrees [[Celsius]] (100.4 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]) 
* oral temperature (in the mouth) is at, or higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit)
* axillar temperature (in the [[armpit]]) is at, or higher than 37.2 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit)

However, there are many variations in normal body temperature, and this needs to be considered when measuring fever. Body temperature normally fluctuates over the day, with the lowest levels at 4 ''[[A.M.]]'' and the highest at 6 ''[[P.M.]]''. Therefore, an oral temperature of 37.5°C would strictly be a fever in the morning, but not in the afternoon. Normal body temperature may differ as much as 0.4°C (0.7°F) between individuals. In women, temperature differs at various points in the [[menstrual cycle]], and this can be used for [[family planning]] (although it is only one of the variables of temperature). Temperature is increased after meals, and psychological factors (like the first day in the hospital) also influence body temperature.

There are different locations where you can measure temperature, and these differ in temperature variability. [[Tympanic membrane]] [[thermometer]]s measure radiant heat energy from the tympanic membrane (=infrared). These may be very convenient, but may also show more variability. 

Children develop higher temperatures with activities like playing, but this is not fever because their set-point is normal. Elderly patients may have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever, so even a low-grade fever can have serious underlying causes in [[geriatrics]].

In conclusion, temperature is ideally always measured the same moment of the day, in the same way, after the same amount of activity.

==مېکانيزم==
Temperature is regulated in the hypothalamus. Substances <!--"which" incorrect: NOT ALL substances induce fever; a distinction is to be made-->that induce fever are called ''pyrogens''. These are both ''external'' or ''exogenous'', such as the bacterial substance [[LPS]], and [[internal]] or [[endogenous]]. The endogenous pyrogens (such as [[interleukin 1]]) are a part of the [[innate immune system]], produced by [[phagocytic cells]], and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set-point in the hypothalamus. The endogenous pyrogens may also come directly from tissue [[necrosis]].

One model for the mechanism of fever is the detection of [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), which is a cell wall component of [[Gram-negative|gram-negative bacteria]].  An immunological protein called [[Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein]] (LBP) binds to LPS.  The LBP-LPS complex then binds to the [[CD14]] receptor of a nearby [[macrophage]].  This binding results in the synthesis and release of various [[cytokine]] factors, such as [[interleukin 1]] (IL-1), [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6), and the [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]].   These cytokine factors are released into general circulation where they migrate to the circumventricular [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the [[brain]], where the [[blood-brain barrier]] is reduced.  The cytokine factors bind with [[endothelium|endothelial receptor]]s on vessel walls, or interact with local [[microglial cell]]s.  When these cytokine factors bind, they activate the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway.  This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the [[enzyme]]s [[phospholipase|phospholipase A2]] (PLA2), [[cyclooxygenase|cyclooxygenase-2]] (COX-2), and [[Prostaglandin|prostaglandin E2]] synthase (membrane-associated protein involved in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism, also known as [[mPEGS-1]]). These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.

PGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The set-point temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts near the [[ventromedial preoptic]] area (VMPO) of the anterior [[hypothalamus]] and the [[parvocellular]] portion of the [[periventricular nucleus]] (PVH), where the thermal properties of fever emerge.  It is presumed that the elevation in thermoregulatory set-point is mediated by the VMPO, whereas the neuroendocrine effects of fever are mediated by the PVH, [[pituitary gland]], and various [[endocrine organs]].  

The brain ultimately orchestrates '''heat effector mechanisms'''. These may be 
* increased heat production by increased [[muscle tone]], [[shivering]] and hormones like epinephrine and [[thyroid hormone]]s, or,
* prevention of heat loss, such as [[vasoconstriction]]. 
The [[autonomic nervous system]] may also activate [[brown adipose tissue]] to produce heat (=non-exercise associated thermogenesis, also known as non-shivering thermogenesis), but this seems mostly important for babies. Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased [[blood pressure]] in fever.

Pyrexia can be classed as 
* low-grade: 38 - 39 °C (100.4 - 102.2 °F)
* moderate: 39 - 40 °C  (102.2 - 104 °F)
* high-grade: > 40 °C  (> 104 °F)
* [[Hyperpyrexia]]:  > 42 °C (> 107.6 °F)
The last is clearly a medical emergency because it approaches the upper limit compatible with human life.

Most of the times, fever types can't be used to find the underlying cause. However, there are specific fever patterns that may occasionally hint the [[diagnosis]]:
* Pel-Ebstein fever is a specific kind of fever associated with [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin disease]], being high for one week and low for the next week and so on. However, there is some debate ([http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/333/1/66]) whether this pattern truly exists.
* [[Typhoid fever]] may show a specific fever pattern, with a slow stepwise increase and a high plateau.
* In [[malaria]], there may be a fever with a periodicity of 48 hours (''tertian fever'') or 72 hours (''quartan fever'', indicating ''Plasmodium vivax''). These patterns may be less clear in travelers.

Fever is a common [[symptom]] of many medical conditions:
* [[infectious disease]], e.g. [[common cold]], [[HIV]], [[malaria]], [[infectious mononucleosis]], [[gastroenteritis]], ''etc.''.
* [[Immunology|Immunological]] diseases like [[lupus erythematosus]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]]s, ''etc.''.
* Tissue destruction, which can occur in [[hemolysis]], [[surgery]], [[infarction]], [[crush syndrome]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[cerebral hemorrhage]], ''etc.''.
* [[Drug fever]]
** directly caused by the drug (e.g. [[progesterone]], [[chemotherapeutics]] causing [[tumor]]  [[necrosis]])
** as an adverse reaction to drugs (e.g. [[antibiotic]]s, [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drug]]s, ''etc.'')
** after drug discontinuation, like with [[heroin]] withdrawal
* [[Cancer]]s such as [[Hodgkin disease]] (with [[Pel-Ebstein fever]])
* [[Metabolic disorder]]s like [[gout]], [[porphyria]], ''etc.''.
* Thrombo-embolic processes (i.e. [[pulmonary embolism]], [[deep venous thrombosis]])

Persistent fever which cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries, is called [[fever of unknown origin]].

Fever should not necessarily be treated. Fever is an important signal that there's something wrong in the body, and it can be used for follow-up. Fever might help the immune system or hinder specific pathogens, but this is generally considered of little importance. Moreover, not all fevers are of infectious origin. 

Even when treatment is not indicated, however, febrile patients are generally advised to keep themselves adequately hydrated, as the [[dehydration]] produced by a mild fever can be more dangerous than the fever itself. Water is generally used for this purpose, but there is always a small risk of [[hyponatremia]] if the patient drinks too much water. For this reason, some patients drink [[sports drinks]] or products designed specifically for this purpose, such as [[Pedialyte]].

Most people take medication against fever because the symptoms cause discomfort. Fever increases [[heart rate]] and [[metabolism]], thus potentially putting an additional strain on elderly patients, patients with [[heart disease]], ''etc''. This may even cause [[delirium]]. Therefore, potential benefits (if any) must be weighed against risks in these patients. In any case, fever must be brought under control in instances when fever escalates to [[hyperpyrexia]], and tissue damage is imminent.

Treatment of fever should primarily be based on lowering the setpoint, but facilitating heat loss may contribute. The former is accomplished with [[antipyretic]]s. Heat loss may be an effect of [[heat conduction]], [[convection]], [[radiation]] or [[evaporation]] ([[sweating]], perspiration). This may be particularly important in babies, where drugs should be avoided. However, when someone would use [[water]] that is too cold, this induces [[vasoconstriction]] and prevents adequate heat loss.
