The brain innervates the [[head]] through [[cranial nerve]]s, and it communicates with the [[spinal cord]], which innervates the body through [[spinal nerve]]s. Nervous fibers transmitting signals from the brain are called [[efferent]] fibers. The fibers transmitting signals to the brain are called [[afferent]] (or sensory) fibers. Nerves can be afferent, efferent or mixed (i.e., containing both types of fibers). 

The brain is the site of reason and intelligence, which include such components as [[cognition]], [[perception]], [[attention]], [[memory]] and [[emotion]]. The brain is also responsible for control of [[posture]] and [[motor control|movements]]. It makes possible cognitive, [[motor learning|motor]] and other forms of [[learning]]. The brain can perform a variety of functions automatically, without the need for [[consciousness|conscious]] awareness, such as coordination of [[sensory system]]s (eg. [[sensory gating]] and [[multisensory integration]]), [[Animal locomotion|walking]], and [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] body functions such as [[heart rate]], [[blood]] pressure, fluid balance, and body temperature.

Many functions are controlled by coordinated activity of the brain and [[spinal cord]]. Moreover, some behaviors such as simple [[reflex action|reflexes]] and basic [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], can be executed under spinal cord control alone.

The brain undergoes transitions from [[Awake|wakefulness]] to [[sleep]] (and subtypes of these states). These state transitions are crucially important for proper brain functioning. (For example, it is believed that sleep is important for knowledge consolidation, as the neurons appear to organize the day's stimuli during deep sleep by randomly firing off the most recently used neuron pathways; additionally, without sleep, normal subjects are observed to develop symptoms resembling mental illness, even auditory hallucinations). Every brain state is associated with characteristic [[brain waves]].

[[Neuron]]s are electrically active brain cells that process information, whereas [[Glia|Glial cells]] perform supporting function. In addition to being electrically active, neurons constantly synthesize neurotransmitters. Neurons modify their properties (guided by [[gene expression]]) under the influence of their input signals. This [[plasticity]] underlies [[learning]] and [[adaptation]]. It is notable that some unused neuron pathways (constructions which have become physically isolated from other cells) may continue to exist long after the memory is absent from consciousness, possibly developing the subconscious.

The study of the brain is known as [[neuroscience]], a field of [[biology]] aimed at understanding the functions of the brain at every level, from the [[molecule|molecular]] up to the [[psychology|psychological]]. There is also a branch of psychology that deals with the anatomy and physiology of the brain, known as [[biopsychology|biological psychology]]. This field of study focuses on each individual part of the brain and how it affects behavior.

== تاريخ ==
{{main|History of the brain}}
old human views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a form of  “cranial stuffing” of sorts.  In Egypt, from the late [[Middle Kingdom]] onwards, in preparation for mummification, the brain was regularly removed, for it was the [[heart]] that was assumed to be the seat of intelligence.  According to [[Herodotus]], during the first step of mummification: ‘The most perfect practice is to extract as much of the brain as possible with an iron tires and what the hook cannot reach is mixed with drugs.’  Over the next five-thousand years, this view came to be reversed; the brain is now known to be the seat of intelligence, although colloquial variations of the former remain, such that someone might know something “by heart”.

The first thoughts of the field of [[psychology]] actually came from ancient philosophers, including [[Aristotle]]. As philosophers became more in tune with medical research over time, the idea of psychology emerged. From that point, different branches of [[psychology]] emerged with different individuals creating new ideas.

{{portalpar|Mind and Brain}}
A distinction is not often made in the [[philosophy of mind]] between the [[mind]] and the brain, and there is some controversy as to their exact relationship, leading to the [[mind-body problem]]. The brain is defined as the physical and biological [[matter]] contained within the [[skull]], responsible for all electrochemical neuronal processes. The mind, however, is seen in terms of mental attributes, such as beliefs or desires. Only some adhere to [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] [[dualistic]] approaches in which the mind exists independently of the brain in some way, such as a [[soul]] or [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]] or [[strong emergence|emergent]] phenomenon. Other dualisms maintain that the mind is a distinct ''[[physics|physical]]'' phenomenon, such as [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic field]], or a [[quantum mind|quantum effect]]. [[Materialistic]] options include beliefs that mentality is [[behaviorism|behavior]] or [[functionalism|function]] or, in the case of [[computationalism|computationalists]] and [[strong AI]] theorists, [[computer software]] (with the brain playing the role of [[computer hardware|hardware]]). [[Idealism]], the belief that all is mind, still has some adherents. At the other extreme, [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialists]] believe minds do not exist at all, and mentalistic language will be replaced by neurological terminology.

Three groups of animals have notably complex brains: the [[arthropod]]s ([[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[arachnid]]s, and others), the [[cephalopod]]s ([[octopus]]es, [[squid]]s, and similar [[mollusk]]s), and the [[craniata|craniates]] ([[vertebrate]]s and [[hagfish]]).<ref name="butler">{{cite journal | last = Butler | first = Ann B. | title = Chordate Evolution and the Origin of Craniates: An Old Brain in a New Head | journal = The Anatomical Record | year = 2000 | volume = 261 | pages = 111–125 }}</ref> The brain of arthropods and cephalopods arises from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal.

The brain of craniates develops from the [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] section of a single dorsal [[neural tube|nerve cord]], which later becomes the [[spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Eric R.

In vertebrates, increasing [[complexity]] in the [[cerebral cortex]] correlates with height on the [[phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic]] and [[evolutionary tree]]. Primitive vertebrates such as [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, and [[amphibian]]s have fewer than six layers of neurons in the outer layer of their brains. This cortical configuration is called the [[allocortex]] (or heterotypic cortex).<ref name="martin">{{cite book | last = Martin | first = John H. | title = Neuroanatomy: Text and Atlas | edition = Second Edition | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 1996 | id = ISBN 0-07-138183-X }}</ref> 

More complex vertebrates such as [[mammal]]s have a six-layered [[neocortex]] (or homotypic cortex, neopallium), in addition to having some parts of the brain that are allocortex.<ref name="martin"/> In mammals, increasing convolutions of the brain are characteristic of animals with more advanced brains. These convolutions provide a larger surface area for a greater number of neurons while keeping the volume of the brain compact enough to fit inside the skull. The folding allows more grey matter to fit into a smaller volume, similar to a really long slinky being able to fit into a tiny box when completely pushed together. The folds are called [[gyrus|gyri]], while the spaces between the folds are called [[Sulcus (anatomy)|sulci]].

Although the general [[histology]] of the brain is similar from person to person, the structural anatomy can differ. Apart from the gross [[embryology|embryological]] divisions of the brain, the location of specific gyri and sulci, primary sensory regions, and other structures differs between species.

In insects, the brain has four parts, the optical lobes, the protocerebrum, the deutocerebrum, and the tritocerebrum. The optical lobes are behind each eye and process visual stimuli.<ref name="butler"/> The protocerebrum contains the [[mushroom bodies]], which respond to [[olfaction|smell]], and the central body complex. In some [[species]] such as [[bee]]s, the mushroom body receives input from the visual pathway as well. The deutocerebrum includes the [[antennal lobe]]s, which are similar to the mammalian [[olfactory bulb]], and the mechanosensory [[neuropil]]s which receive information from [[Somatosensory system|touch]] receptors on the head and [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. The antennal lobes of [[fly|flies]] and [[moth]]s are quite complex.

In cephalopods, the brain has two regions: the supraesophageal mass and the subesophageal mass,<ref name="butler"/> separated by the [[esophagus]]. The supra- and subesophageal masses are connected to each other on either side of the esophagus by the basal lobes and the dorsal magnocellular lobes.<ref name="butler"/> The large optic lobes are sometimes not considered to be part of the brain, as they are anatomically separate and are joined to the brain by the optic stalks. However, the optic lobes perform much visual processing, and so functionally are part of the brain.

{{Cerebrum map|Human Brain|caption=<small>The lobes of the cerebral cortex include the frontal (blue), temporal (green), occipital (red), and parietal lobes (yellow). The cerebellum (not colored) is not part of the telencephalon. In vertebrates a gross division into three major parts is used.</small>}}

The [[telencephalon]] (cerebrum) is the largest region of the mammalian brain. This is the structure that is most easily visible in brain specimens, and is what most people associate with the "brain". In humans and several other animals, the fissures (sulci) and convolutions (gyri) give the brain a wrinkled appearance. In non-mammalian vertebrates with no cerebrum, the [[metencephalon]] is the highest center in the brain. Because humans walk upright, there is a flexure, or bend, in the brain between the [[brain stem]] and the cerebrum. Other vertebrates do not have this flexure. Generally, comparing the locations of certain brain structures between humans and other vertebrates often reveals a number of differences.

Behind (or in humans, below) the cerebrum is the cerebellum. The cerebellum is known to be involved in the control of movement,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Eric R. Kandel | last = Kandel | first = ER | coauthors = Schwartz JH, Jessell TM | title = [[Principles of Neural Science]] | edition = 4th ed. | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2000 | id = ISBN 0-8385-7701-6 }}</ref> and is connected by thick white matter fibers (cerebellar peduncles) to the [[pons]].<ref name="martin"/> The cerebrum and the [[cerebellum]] each have two hemispheres. The telencephalic hemispheres are connected by the [[corpus callosum]], another large white matter tract. An outgrowth of the telencephalon called the [[olfactory bulb]] is a major structure in many animals, but in humans and other primates it is relatively small.

Vertebrate nervous systems are distinguished by [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetrical]] [[encephalization]]. Encephalization refers to the tendency for more complex organisms to gain larger brains through evolutionary time. Larger vertebrates develop a complex, layered and interconnected neuronal circuitry. In modern species most closely related to the first vertebrates, brains are covered with gray matter that has a three-layer structure (allocortex). Their brains also contain deep brain nuclei and fiber tracts forming the white matter. Most regions of the human cerebral cortex have six layers of neurons (neocortex).<ref name="martin"/>

{{main|human brain}}

The structure of the human brain differs from that of other animals in several important ways. These differences allow for many abilities over and above those of other animals, such as advanced cognitive skills. Human encephalization is especially pronounced in the neocortex, the most complex part of the cerebral cortex. The proportion of the human brain that is devoted to the neocortex—especially to the [[prefrontal cortex]]—is larger than in all other [[mammal]]s (indeed larger than in all animals, although only in mammals has the neocortex evolved to fulfill this kind of function).

Humans have unique neural capacities, but much of their brain structure is similar to that of other mammals. Basic systems that alert the nervous system to stimulus, that sense events in the environment, and monitor the condition of the body are similar to those of even non-mammalian vertebrates. The neural circuitry underlying human consciousness includes both the advanced neocortex and prototypical structures of the brainstem. The human brain also has a massive number of synaptic connections allowing for a great deal of [[parallel processing]].

== وژيزه ژونپوهنه ==
The brain is composed of two broad classes of cells, [[neuron]]s and [[glia]], both of which contain several different cell types which perform different functions. Interconnected neurons form [[neural network]]s (or [[neural ensemble]]s). These networks are similar to man-made [[electrical circuit]]s in that they contain circuit elements (neurons) connected by biological wires (nerve fibers). These do not form simple one-to-one electrical circuits like many man-made circuits, however. Typically neurons connect to at least a thousand other neurons.<ref>{{cite book | title = Basic Histology: Text and Atlas | edition = 10th ed. | first = L.C. | last = Junqueira | coauthors = J. Carneiro }} (Statistic from page 161)</ref> These highly specialized circuits make up systems which are the basis of [[perception]], different types of action, and higher cognitive function.

=== وبپوهنه ===
{{Neuron map|[[Neuron]]}}
Neurons are the cells that generate [[action potential]]s and convey information to other cells; these constitute the essential class of brain cells.

In addition to neurons, the brain contains glial cells in a roughly 10:1 proportion to neurons. Glial cells ("glia" is Greek for “glue”) form a support system for neurons. They create the insulating myelin, provide structure to the neuronal network, manage waste, and clean up neurotransmitters. Most types of glia in the brain are present in the entire [[nervous system]]. Exceptions include the [[oligodendrocyte]]s which myelinate neural [[axon]]s (a role performed by [[Schwann cell]]s in the peripheral nervous system). The myelin in the oligodendrocytes insulates the axons of some neurons. [[White matter]] in the brain is myelinated neurons, while [[grey matter]] contains mostly cell [[soma (biology)|soma]], [[dendrite]]s, and unmyelinated portions of axons and glia. The space between neurons is filled with dendrites as well as unmyelinated segments of axons; this area is referred to as the [[neuropil]].

In mammals, the brain is surrounded by [[connective tissue]]s called the [[meninges]], a system of membranes that separate the skull from the brain. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the [[dura mater]], [[arachnoid mater]], and [[pia mater]]. The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the pia-arachnoid. Below the arachnoid is the subarachnoid space which contains [[cerebrospinal fluid]], a substance that protects the nervous system. [[Blood vessel]]s enter the central nervous system through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the [[blood-brain barrier]] which protects the brain from [[toxin]]s that might enter through the blood.

The brain is bathed in [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), which circulates between layers of the meninges and through cavities in the brain called [[Ventricular system|ventricles]]. It is important both chemically for [[metabolism]] and mechanically for shock-prevention. For example, the human brain weighs about 1-1.5 [[kilograms|kg]]. The [[mass]] and [[density]] of the brain are such that it will begin to collapse under its own weight if unsupported by the CSF. The CSF allows the brain to float, easing the physical [[stress (physics)|stress]] caused by the brain’s mass.

Vertebrate brains receive signals through nerves arriving from the sensors of the organism. These signals are then processed throughout the central nervous system; reactions are formulated based upon reflex and learned experiences. A similarly extensive nerve network delivers signals from a brain to control important muscles throughout the body. Anatomically, the majority of afferent and efferent nerves (with the exception of the [[cranial nerves]]) are connected to the spinal cord, which then transfers the signals to and from the brain.

Sensory input is processed by the brain to recognize danger, find food, identify potential mates, and perform more sophisticated functions. [[Visual perception|Visual]], touch, and [[hearing (sense)|auditory]] sensory pathways of vertebrates are routed to specific nuclei of the [[thalamus]] and then to regions of the cerebral cortex that are specific to each [[sensory system]]. The [[visual system]], the [[auditory system]], and the [[somatosensory system]]. Olfactory pathways are routed to the olfactory bulb, then to various parts of the [[olfactory system]]. [[Taste]] is routed through the brainstem and then to other portions of the [[gustatory system]].

To control movement the brain has several parallel systems of muscle control. The motor system controls voluntary muscle movement, aided by the [[motor cortex]], [[cerebellum]], and the [[basal ganglia]]. The system eventually projects to the spinal cord and then out to the muscle effectors. Nuclei in the brain stem control many involuntary muscle functions such as heart rate and breathing. In addition, many automatic acts (simple reflexes, locomotion) can be controlled by the spinal cord alone.

Brains also produce a portion of the body's [[hormone]]s that can influence organs and glands elsewhere in a body—conversely, brains also react to hormones produced elsewhere in the body. In mammals, the hormones that regulate hormone production throughout the body are produced in the brain by the structure called the [[pituitary gland]].

It is hypothesized that developed brains derive consciousness from the complex interactions between the numerous systems within the brain. Cognitive processing in mammals occurs in the cerebral cortex but relies on midbrain and [[limbic system|limbic]] functions as well. Among "younger" (in an evolutionary sense) vertebrates, advanced processing involves progressively rostral (forward) regions of the brain.

Hormones, incoming sensory information, and cognitive processing performed by the brain determine the brain state. Stimulus from any source can trigger a general arousal process that focuses cortical operations to processing of the new information. This focusing of cognition is known as [[attention]]. Cognitive priorities are constantly shifted by a variety of factors such as hunger, fatigue, belief, unfamiliar information, or threat. The simplest dichotomy related to the processing of threats is the [[fight-or-flight response]] mediated by the [[amygdala]] and other limbic structures.

Clinically, [[death]] is defined as an absence of brain activity as measured by EEG. Injuries to the brain tend to affect large areas of the organ, sometimes causing major deficits in intelligence, memory, and movement. Head trauma caused, for example, by vehicle and industrial accidents, is a leading cause of death in youth and middle age. In many cases, more damage is caused by resultant swelling ([[edema]]) than by the impact itself. [[Stroke]], caused by the blockage or rupturing of blood vessels in the brain, is another major cause of death from brain damage.

Other problems in the brain can be more accurately classified as diseases rather than injuries. [[Neurodegenerative disease]]s, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[motor neurone disease]], and [[Huntington's disease]] are caused by the gradual death of individual neurons, leading to decrements in movement control, memory, and cognition. Currently only the symptoms of these diseases can be treated. [[Mental illness]]es, such as [[clinical depression]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] are brain diseases that impact [[Wiktionary:personality|personality]] and, typically, other aspects of mental and somatic function. These disorders may be treated by [[psychiatry|psychiatric therapy]], [[medication|pharmaceutical]] intervention, or through a combination of treatments; therapeutic effectiveness varies significantly among individuals.

Some infectious diseases affecting the brain are caused by [[virus]]es and [[bacteria]]. Infection of the [[meninges]], the membrane that covers the brain, can lead to [[meningitis]]. [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (also known as mad cow disease), is deadly in [[cattle]] and humans and is linked to [[prion]]s. [[Kuru (disease)|Kuru]] is a similar prion-borne degenerative brain disease affecting humans. Both are linked to the ingestion of neural tissue, and may explain the tendency in some species to avoid [[cannibalism]]. Viral or bacterial causes have been substantiated in [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Lyme disease]], [[encephalopathy]], and [[encephalomyelitis]].

Some brain disorders are [[congenital disorder|congenital]]. [[Tay-Sachs disease]], [[Fragile X syndrome]], and [[Down syndrome]] are all linked to [[gene]]tic and [[chromosome|chromosomal]] errors.  Malfunctions in the embryonic [[neural development|development]] of the brain can be caused by genetic factors, [[drug use]], and [[disease]] during a mother's [[pregnancy]].

Certain brain disorders are treated by brain surgeons (neurosurgeons) while others are treated by neurologists and psychiatrists.

Each method for observing activity in the brain has its advantages and drawbacks. Electrophysiology allows scientists to record the electrical activity of individual neurons or groups of neurons.  

==== EEG ====
By placing electrodes on the scalp one can record the summed electrical activity of the cortex in a technique known as [[electroencephalography]] (EEG). EEG measures the mass changes in electrical current from the cerebral cortex, but can only detect changes over large areas of the brain with very little sub-cortical activity.

==== MEG ====
Apart from measuring the electric field around the skull it is possible to measure the magnetic field directly in a technique known as [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG). This technique has the same temporal resolution as EEG but much better spatial resolution, although admittedly not as good as fMRI. The main advantage over fMRI is a direct relationship between neural activation and measurement.

==== fMRI او PET ====
	

[[دوتنه:Pnsagittal.jpg|thumb|A scan of the brain using fMRI]]

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in [[blood flow]] in the brain, but the activity of neurons is not directly measured, nor can it be distinguished whether this activity is inhibitory or excitatory. fMRI is a noninvasive, indirect method for measuring neural activity that is based on '''BOLD'''; '''B'''lood '''O'''xygen '''L'''evel '''D'''ependent changes.  The changes in blood flow that occur in capillary beds in specific regions of the brain are thought to represent  various neuronal activities ([[metabolism]] of synaptic reuptake). Similarly, a positron emission tomography (PET), is able to monitor [[glucose]] and [[oxygen]] metabolism as well as neurotransmitter activity in different areas within the brain which can be correlated to the level of activity in that region.

==== Behavioral ====
Behavioral tests can measure symptoms of disease and mental performance, but can only provide indirect measurements of brain function and may not be practical in all animals. In humans however, a neurological exam can be done to determine the location of any trauma, [[lesion]], or [[tumor]] within the brain, brain stem, or spinal cord.

==== اناتوميک ====
[[post-mortem|Autopsy]] analysis of the brain allows for the study of anatomy and [[protein]] expression patterns, but is only possible after the human or animal is dead. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can be used to study the anatomy of a living creature and is widely used in both research and medicine.

Current research has also focused on recreating the neural structure of the brain with the aim of producing human-like cognition and artificial intelligence.

Brain consumption can also result in contracting fatal [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]] such as Variant [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] and other [[prion]] diseases in humans and [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] in cattle.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collinge | first = John | date = 2001 | title = Prion diseases of humans and animals: their causes and molecular basis | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 24 | pages = 519–50 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11283320 | id = PMID 11283320 }}</ref> Another prion disease called [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] has been traced to a funerary ritual among the [[Fore]] people of [[Papua New Guinea]] in which those close to the dead would eat the brain of the deceased to create a sense of [[immortality]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = S | coauthors = McLean CA, Masters CL | date = 2001 | title = Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome,fatal familial insomnia, and kuru: a review of these less common human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies | journal = Journal of Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | ages = 387–97 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11535002 | id = PMID 11535002 }}</ref> Some [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence suggests that the mourning rituals of [[Europe]]an [[Neanderthal]]s also involved the consumption of the brain.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ean=9781582432533&displayonly=CHP | title = The Aztec Treasure House | last = Connell | first = Evan S. | publisher = Counterpoint Press | year = 2001 | id = ISBN 1-58243-162-0 }}</ref>

It is also well known in the hunting community that the brain of wild animals should not be consumed, due to the risk of [[chronic wasting disease]].

The [[neurons]] of the brain require a lot of energy. 75% <ref name=popular> [http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/61994314e58fb010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html/ Popular science] </ref> of the blood sugar created by the liver is consumed by the brain. The brain also consumes 20%<ref name=popular/> of the oxygen a human breathes. The energy consumption for the brain to simply survive is 0.1 <ref name=popular/> calories per minute, while this value can be as high as 1.5<ref name=popular/> calories per minute during crossword puzzle-solving.
