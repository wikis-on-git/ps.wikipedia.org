Dadullah had reportedly been a central figure in the recruitment of Pakistani nationals to the Taliban<ref name=Afgha /> and was also one of the main Taliban spokesmen, frequently meeting with Al-Jazeera television reporters.<ref name=JPost1>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1148482062130&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Captured Taliban leader appears on Al-Jazeera], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', [[May 29]] [[2006]]</ref> In the summer of 2006, he was reportedly sent by Mullah Omar to [[South Waziristan]] to convince local Pashtun insurgents to agree to a [[Waziristan Accord|truce with Pakistan]].<ref name=Telegraph1>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/24/wafg24.xml Omar role in truce reinforces fears that Pakistan 'caved in' to Taliban], ''[[Daily Telegraph]], [[September 24]] [[2006]]</ref>  In October 2006 it was rumored<ref name=Nation1>[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061030/parenti_video Taliban Rising], ''[[The Nation]]'', [[October 12]] [[2006]]</ref> that the Afghan government was considering giving control of its defense ministry over to Dadullah as part of a reconciliation plan with the Taliban to stop the ongoing insurgency.

Mullah Dadullah was linked to massacres of Shi'a, the scorched earth policy of Shi'a villages in 2001 (which he boasted about once on the radio), and the summary execution of men suspected of throwing hand grenades into his compound in 2001 (they were hanged at one of the main roundabouts).  According to an interview he gave to the [[BBC]], he had hundreds of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombers]] waiting for his orders to launch an offensive against [[NATO]] troops.<ref name="BBC-may13">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6650755.stm Afghan Taleban commander killed], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[May 13]], [[2007]]</ref>

Dadullah oversaw Taliban negotiations for the hostage-taking of Italian reporter [[Daniele Mastrogiacomo]] and his two Afghani assistants in March 2007. Mastrogiacomo was reportedly exchanged for five senior Taliban leaders, including Ustad Yasar, Abdul Latif Hakimi, Mansoor Ahmad, a brother of Dadullah, and two commanders identified as Hamdullah and Abdul Ghaffar. The Taliban leader threatened to kill the interpreter Adjmal Nasqhbandi, one of the two Afghan assistants, on [[March 29]] [[2007]] unless the [[Kabul]] government freed two Taliban prisoners.<ref name=Reuters1>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL293332420070329 Taliban leader threatens to kill Afghan hostage], ''[[Reuters]], [[March 29]] [[2007]]</ref>
