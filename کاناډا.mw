{{main|د کاناډا جغرافيه}}
Canada occupies the northern portion of [[North America]]. It shares land borders with the [[contiguous United States]] to the south and with [[Alaska]] to the northwest, stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west; to the north lies the [[Arctic Ocean]].  Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60° and 141° W [[longitude]] ([http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1]); this claim is not universally recognized. The northernmost settlement in Canada (and in the world) is [[CFS Alert|Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert]] on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]] – latitude 82.5° N – just 834 kilometres (450 [[nautical mile]]s) from the North Pole.  Canada is the world's second-largest country in total area, after [[Russia]].  

The population density of 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1/[[square mile|mi²]]) is among the lowest in the world.  The most densely populated part of the country is the [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]] in the southeast.  To the north of this region is the broad [[Canadian Shield]], an area of rock scoured clean by the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]], thinly soiled, rich in minerals, and dotted with lakes and rivers — more than 60% of the world's lakes are in Canada.

[[Newfoundland]] is at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest [[estuary]]. The [[Canadian Maritimes]] protrude eastward from the southern coasts of Quebec.  [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from [[British Columbia]].

[[دوتنه:MountLogan.jpg|بټنوک|کيڼ|250px|[[Mount Logan]] in [[Yukon]]; at 5,959 metres (19,551 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), Canada's highest point and second highest in North America.]]Northern Canadian vegetation tapers from [[coniferous]] forests to [[tundra]] and finally to Arctic barrens in the far north. The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic islands|archipelago]] containing some of the world's largest islands.

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada range depending on the location.
Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the Prairie provinces where daily average temperatures are near -15 °[[Celsius|C]] (5 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) Coastal British Columbia is an exception and it enjoys a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter. 

Average summer high temperatures across Canada range depending on the location.  On the east and west coast average high temperatures are in the low 20s °C (68-74&nbsp;°F), while in between the coasts the average summer high temperature range between 25&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C (78-86&nbsp;°F).

== اقتصاد ==

:''Main articles: [[د کاناډا اقتصاد]], [[Economic history of Canada]]
An affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards. In the last century, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada has vast deposits of natural gas on the east coast and in the west, and a plethora of other natural resources contributing to self-sufficiency in energy. The 1989 [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) and 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the U.S. Since 2001, Canada has successfully avoided economic recession and has maintained the best overall economic performance in the [[G8]].

== Demographics ==
:''Main articles: [[Demographics of Canada]], [[List of Canadians by ethnicity]]
The [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 national census]] recorded 30,007,094 people; as of January 2006, the population is estimated by [[Statistics Canada]] to be 32.4 million people[http://www.statcan.ca/english/edu/clock/population.htm], an increase of some 2.4 million people accomplished largely by [[immigration]] and (to a lesser extent) natural growth. About three-quarters of Canada's population live within 150 kilometres (95&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of the U.S. border. A similar proportion live in [[Urban Area|urban areas]] concentrated in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor (notably the [[Toronto]]-[[Hamilton]], [[Montréal]], and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa]] [[metropolitan area]]s), the BC [[Lower Mainland]], and the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] in Alberta.

[[دوتنه:Cntower3.jpg|بټنوک|ښي|200px|[[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] is one of the world's most multicultural cities.]]
Canada is a very ethnically diverse nation. According to the 2001 census by [[Statcan]] it has 34 ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each, and numerous others represented in smaller amounts. A majority of Canadians descend from [[white]] [[Europe]]an immigrants who arrived in increasing numbers until WWI.  This majority--86.9% in 2001, is growing slower than the rest of the population. The most frequently stated [[white]] [[European]] ancestries are [[England|English]] (19.2%), [[France|French]] (15.7%), [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (14%), [[Irish]] (12.9%), [[German people|German]] (9.0%), and [[Italian people|Italian]] (4.3%)[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm]. 

Throughout and since the [[world war]]s, [[immigration]] to Canada has fluctuated somewhat but become more heterogeneous in makeup.  In 2001, 13.4% of the population belonged to visible minorities: most numerous among these are [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (3.5% of the population), [[Indo-Canadian|South Asian]] (3.1%), [[Black Canadian|Black]] (2.2%), and [[Filipino Canadian|Filipino]] (1.0%).

=== Aboriginal peoples ===
{{main|Aboriginal peoples in Canada}}
The [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution Act of 1982]] recognizes three groups of [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]]: the "Indians" (their legal designation, but now usually called [[First Nations]]), [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]. The aboriginal population is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the population in Canada. According to the [[Canada 2001 Census]], people identified themselves as aboriginal numbered 976,305 people (or 3.3% of Canada's population) of whom about 62% are First Nations, 30% are Métis, and 5% are Inuit.

=== مذهب ===
{{main|د کاناډا مذهب}}
According to the last census [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a.htm]77.1% of Canadians identified as being [[Christianity|Christians]]; of this, [[Catholicism|Catholics]] make up the largest group – 43.6% of Canadians. About 17% of Canadians declared no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity such as [[Sikhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]].

:''Main articles: [[د کاناډا ژبې]], [[Bilingualism in Canada]]''
د كاناډا رسمي ژپه انګليسي او فرانسوي ده په كوم چي دوګړو 56فيصد او28فيصده يي پري خبري كوي.  On [[July 7]], [[1969]], under the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], French was made commensurate to English throughout the federal government. This started a process that led to Canada redefining itself as a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation.

English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions.
The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. While multiculturalism is official policy, to ''become'' a citizen one must be able to speak either English or French and more than 98% of Canadians speak English or French or both.  While the nation remains officially bilingual, the majority of Canadians are fluent only in English. 

French is mostly spoken in [[Quebec]] with pockets in [[New Brunswick]], eastern and northern [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], the south shore of [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[Manitoba]]. Of those who speak French as a [[first language]], 85% live in Quebec. 

Several [[Canada#Aboriginal peoples|aboriginal]] languages have official status in [[Northwest Territories]]. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in [[Nunavut]] and has official status there.
Non-official languages are also important in Canada, with 5,470,820 people listing a non-official language as a first language. (The above three statistics include those who listed more than one first language.) Among the most important non-official first language groups are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi]] (271,220).

:''Main articles: [[د کاناډا کلتور/فرهڼ]], [[Canadian identity]]''
Due to its colonial past, Canadian culture has historically been heavily influenced by English, French, Irish and Scottish cultures and traditions. In more modern times, Canadian culture is now greatly influenced by American culture, due to the proximity and the migration of people, ideas, and capital. 

Many American movies, authors, TV shows, and [[List of Canadian musicians|musicians]] are equally popular in Canada (and vice versa), many have been successful worldwide. Most cultural products of these types are now increasingly marketed toward a unified "North American" market, and not specifically a Canadian or American one.

Amidst this large American cultural presence, which has prompted some fears of a "cultural takeover", a more robust and distinct Canadian culture with unique characteristics has developed in recent years due to a focus by the federal government on programs, laws and institutions to support culture and the arts, including the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], the [[National Film Board of Canada]], and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]]. 

Many Canadian citizens see Canadian culture as based on the policy of [[multiculturalism]], while others see it as based on a predominantly [[British culture|British]] and [[French culture|French]] core, with [[American culture|American]] and new immigrant influences and modifications.

{{main|Sport in Canada}}
Canada's official national sports are [[ice hockey]] (winter) and [[lacrosse]] (summer), however, hockey is considerably more a part of Canadian culture, and is by far the most popular spectator sport in the country.  Canada's six  [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] have franchises in the [[National Hockey League]], and there are more Canadian players in the league than from all other countries combined.  The three major junior leagues that together comprise the [[Canadian Hockey League]] have a combined total of 49 teams in Canadian towns or cities, from all 10 provinces.  There are also strong women's leagues across the country

[[Curling]] is another extremely popular winter sport in Canada, with the strongest support in the prairie provinces.  At the international level, Canada has dominated the sport of curling, with 29 out of 46 Men's [[List of World Curling Men's Champions|World Curling Championships]] won by Canada.  Additionally, 13 out of 27 Women's World Curling Championships have gone to the Canadian side. 

[[Canadian football]], like [[American football]], is a descendant from [[rugby football]] but evolved differently and has unique rules.  The nine team [[Canadian Football League]] is the top league of the sport, and the annual [[Grey Cup]] championship game is viewed by a large television audience. Traditional [[association football|football]] (soccer) is widely popular in youth, interscholastic, and senior leagues but not at the professional level as it is in Europe or Latin America. 

As the vast majority of Canadians live in very close proximity to the [[United States]], Canadians can also watch sporting events from the professional leagues in that country, such as [[NASCAR]] and the [[National Football League]]. The NHL and the [[National Lacrosse League]] are comprised of teams from both Canada and the United States, and [[Toronto]] currently has franchises in [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Basketball Association]].  Other notable participatory sports which are enjoyed throughout Canada include [[skating]], [[skiing]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], [[swimming]], [[baseball]] and [[softball]].

=== ملي نښانونه ===
[[دوتنه:Maple leaf.jpg|بټنوک|200px|ښي|The maple leaf is the characteristic [[leaf]] of the [[maple tree]], and is an important [[national symbol]] of Canada.]]
The use of the [[maple leaf]] as a Canadian symbol dates back to the early 18th century, and is depicted on its [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Red Ensign|previous]] flags, the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|coat of arms]].

The Crown appears on the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]] (displayed in many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SSC-Courtroom.jpg courtrooms] and [http://www.pm.gc.ca/ government websites]); the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]]; the [[Coat of arms of Quebec|Coat of Arms]] of many provinces as well as [[Nunavut]]; the badges of the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]], many [[The Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Regiments]], and [[Ontario Provincial Police|Police Forces]]; as well as some highway signs.  Also, the [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen's]] image appears in Canadian government buildings, military installations and schools; and on Canadian [[Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp (Canada)|stamps]], $20 [[Canadian dollar|notes]], and all coins.  

Canada is known for its vast forests and mountain ranges, and the animals that reside within them, such as [[moose]], [[caribou]], [[beaver]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[grizzly bear]]s, [[Canada goose]] and the [[common loon]]. The [[beaver]]'s emblematic status originated from the fact much of Canada's early economic history was tied to the [[fur trade]].  Other products made from the country's natural resources, such as [[maple syrup]], are also strongly associated with Canadian identity.  

Additional national symbols the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and anything pertaining to [[ice hockey|hockey]], Canada's official winter sport, which is often used as a national symbol of unity and pride. 

In recent years, other symbols have become a source of pride: notably, the ''[[I am Canadian]]'' campaign by [[Molson]], most notably the commercial featuring [[Joe Canada]], infused [[Canadian beer|home-grown beer]] with nationalism. The Canadian fashion retailer [[Roots Canada Ltd.|Roots]] also sells a variety of merchandise designed to evoke nationalistic sentiment.

Statutory and major holidays in Canada include [[New Year's Day]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]] [[Easter Monday|Monday]], [[Victoria Day]], [[Canada Day]], [[Labour Day]], [[Thanksgiving]], [[Remembrance Day]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]].

Canada's provinces and territories generally adopt statutory holidays similar to federal ones with some variations (including [[civic holiday]]s), and many Canadians celebrate numerous unofficial and religious holidays as well.
