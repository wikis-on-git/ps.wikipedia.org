'''کاناډا''' is a [[country]] occupying the northern portion of [[North America]], and is the world's [[List of countries by area|second largest]] country in total area.

Inhabited exclusively for several millennia by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]], Canada was founded as a union of [[British colony|British colonies]], some of which had earlier been [[French colonial empire|French colonies]].  A [[federation|federal]] [[dominion]] of ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] with three [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories of Canada|territories]], Canada peacefully obtained its sovereignty from its last colonial possessor, the [[United Kingdom]], in a process beginning in 1867 and ending in 1982 when Canada gained the authority to amend its own constitution.

Canada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. Canada's [[head of state]] is its [[Monarchy in Canada|monarch]], who is represented in Canada by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]].  The head of government is the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]. 

Canada defines itself as a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation. Both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] are official languages. In the early [[1970s]], Canada began to adopt policies based on the concepts of cultural diversity and multiculturalism.  Many Canadians now view this as one of the country's key attributes.

A technologically advanced and industrialized nation, Canada is a net exporter of energy because of its large fossil fuel deposits, [[nuclear energy]] generation, and [[hydroelectric power]] capacity. Its diversified [[Economy of Canada|economy]] relies heavily on an abundance of natural resources and trade, particularly with the [[United States]], with which Canada has had a long and complex relationship, one which can be described as the strongest trade partnership in history.

{{main|Canada's name}}  
The name ''Canada'' is believed to come from the [[Wyandot|Huron]]-[[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois]] word ''kanata'', which means "village" or "settlement". In 1535, locals used the word to tell [[Jacques Cartier]] the way to [[Stadacona]], site of present-day Quebec City. Cartier used Canada to refer not only to Stadacona, but also to the entire area subject to Donnacona, Chief at Stadacona; by 1547, maps began referring to this and the surrounding area as Canada.

==تاريخ==
{{Canadian History box}}
:''Main articles: [[History of Canada]], [[Timeline of Canadian history]]''

===Prehistory===
Aboriginal tradition holds that the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Peoples]] have inhabited parts of what is now called Canada since the dawn of time. Archaeological records show that these lands have been inhabited for at least 10,000 years. Several [[Viking]] expeditions occurred circa AD 1000, with evidence of settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]].
YOu are all idiots and need medical help

===European settlement===
During the early part of the 16th century both [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] claimed to portions of land in what is current day Canada.  British claims to North America date from 1497, when [[John Cabot]] reached what he called ''Newfoundland'', though it is unclear whether Cabot landed in current [[Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]], or [[Maine]]. French claims date from explorations by [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534 and [[Samuel de Champlain]] in 1603.  Neither Cabot's nor Cartier's explorations left any permanent settlers behind. Then on [[August 5]], 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] claimed Newfoundland as [[England]]'s first overseas colony under the [[Royal Charter]] of [[Queen Elizabeth I]].  In 1604, French settlers were the first Europeans to settle permanently in what is now Canada. After an unsuccessful winter in St. Croix Island (in current-day Maine) the French settlers settled Port-Royal in what is now the [[Annapolis Valley]] in Nova Scotia, and later moved to found [[Quebec City]] in 1608.   [[New France]] was generally used as the name given to the French colonies in Canada and Acadia (and later [[Louisiana]]).

[[Image:Death-wolfe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', painted by [[Benjamin West]], depicts British [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]]'s final moments during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759.]]

During this time [[English colonization of the Americas|British settlements]] were established along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]] and around [[Hudson Bay]]. As these colonies expanded, a struggle for control of North America took place between 1689 and 1763 in the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]], which was exacerbated by wars in Europe between France and Great Britain.  France progressively lost territory to Great Britain, surrendering peninsular Nova Scotia in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and the remainder of New France, including what was left of Acadia, in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

===British control===
During and after the [[American Revolution]] approximately 70,000 [[Loyalists]] fled the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. {{ref|UEL1}}  Of these, roughly 50,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] settled in the [[British North America|British North American]] colonies which then consisted of [[Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]], and [[Prince Edward Island]] (created 1769). {{ref|UEL}} To accommodate the Loyalists, Britain created the colony of [[New Brunswick]] in 1784 from part of Nova Scotia, and divided Quebec and Ontario into [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] under the [[Constitutional Act]] in [[1791]].

In 1812 the U.S. attacked British forces in Canada starting the [[War of 1812]] in an attempt to end British influence in North America, and particularly, the British seizures of American merchant ships in the Atlantic;  the Americans mistakenly believed that many Canadians shared their negative view of the British Empire. During the war U.S. forces burned [[Battle of York|York]] (current-day [[Toronto]]) in April 1813, which led to a suprise attack by the British resulting in the [[burning of Washington]] (DC) in August 1814, during which the President's residence was burned. The war ended with no land lost with the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in December 1814.  After the French and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]] ended in Europe in November 1815 large-scale [[immigration]] to Canada resumed from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and Europe.

Following the [[Rebellions of 1837]], in an attempt to assimilate french Canadians, [[The Canadas]] were merged into a single colony, the [[United Province of Canada]], with the [[Act of Union (1840)]]. In 1846 when the U.S. and Britain agreed to the [[49th parallel north]] as the border with western British North America, the British government created the colonies of [[British Columbia]] in 1848 and [[Vancouver Island]] in 1849.  The area between the Province of Canada and the colony of British Columbia, [[Rupert's Land]], was administered by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], but by the late 1850s, politicians in the Province of Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions with the intention of assuming control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Arctic]] region.

===Confederation===
[[Image:Johnamacdonald1870.jpg|thumb|left|The Right Honourable Sir [[John A. Macdonald]], first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].]]In 1864 and 1866, British North American politicians, in what became known as the [[Great Coalition]], held three conferences to create a federal union. Spearheaded by [[John A. Macdonald]], on [[July 1]], [[1867]], three colonies&mdash;Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick&mdash;were granted a [[constitution]], the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]], by the United Kingdom, creating the Dominion of Canada.  The term "[[Canadian Confederation]]" refers to this 1867 unification of the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Canada (formerly comprising Canada East or Lower Canada, and Canada West or Upper Canada). The remaining British colonies and territories soon [[Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|joined Confederation]].  By 1880, Canada included all of its present area except for [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (which would join in 1949).  At that time, the vast area outside of the seven provinces were formed into the territory of [[Northwest Territories]], but over the years most of it would be transferred to three existing provinces, two new ones ([[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], 1905), and two new territories ([[Yukon]], 1898; [[Nunavut]], 1999).

In 1919, Canada became a member of the [[League of Nations]] and, in the [[Imperial Conference]] of 1926, Canada assumed full control of its own affairs through the [[Balfour Declaration 1926|Balfour Declaration]]. In 1927, Canada appointed its first [[ambassador]] to a foreign country, the [[United States]]. In 1931, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] gave the [[Balfour Declaration 1926|Balfour Declaration]] constitutional force, confirming that no act of the UK's parliament would thereafter extend to Canada without its consent.
Canadian [[citizenship]] was first distinguished from British in 1947; judicial appeals to the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] ended in 1949. The power to amend Canada's [[constitution of Canada|constitution]] remained with the British parliament, although subject to the Statute of Westminster, until it was "patriated" to Canadian control by the [[Canada Act 1982]].

===Quebec sovereignty movement ===
The [[Quebec sovereignty movement]] has led to two [[referendum|referendums]] held in 1980 and 1995, with votes of 59.6% and 50.6% respectively against its proposals for [[sovereignty-association]]. In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled unilateral secession by a province to be [[unconstitutional]]. Since then, the question of "national unity" has been raised in federal elections, in particular, the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal elections]]. 

The cornerstone of the ideology for a sovereign Quebec was a strong impetus for the [[October Crisis]] and the need to counter Quebec sovereignty through a "[[sponsorship]] program" engendered under the administration of former Prime Minister [[Jean Chretien]]. See [[sponsorship scandal]] for more details.

==حکومت==
{{main|د کاناډا سياست}}
[[Image:Canada Parliament2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Centre Block, [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].]]
Canada is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament|parliamentary government]], and strong [[Democracy|democratic]] traditions. The [[political system]] under which Canada operates is a [[Westminster system]] derived from the [[United Kingdom]].  

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists of [http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/const/index.html written text] and unwritten traditions and conventions. The federal government and the governments of nine provinces agreed to the [[Constitutional history of Canada|patriation of the constitution]], with procedures for amending it, at a meeting of First Ministers in November 1981. The Quebec government did not agree to the changes, and Quebec nationalists refer to that date as the [[Night of the Long Knives (1981)|Night of the Long Knives]]. 

The patriation of the Constitution included the adoption of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees basic rights and freedoms for Canadians that, generally, cannot be overridden by legislation of any level of government in Canada. It contains, however, a "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]", which allows the federal parliament and the provincial legislatures the power to override other sections of the Charter temporarily, for a period of five years.

===The Monarch===
{{main|Monarchy in Canada}}
[[Image:Queen of canada wob.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Queen Elizabeth II, [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen of Canada]].]]

Canada is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[Commonwealth Realm]] that formally recognizes [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada. {{ref|GG1}} Though the [[United Kingdom]] and Canada share the same Monarch, the Queen of Canada is a legally separate role from the Queen of the United Kingdom.

The role of the sovereign, which on paper seems to be all-encompassing, is contrasted with the reality that the Queen is bound by convention to exercise her powers very rarely, and is thus largely a figurehead. Instead, the great majority of the Monarch's powers, prerogatives, and duties are performed on a day-to-day basis by the Governor General at the federal level and by the Lieutenant-Governors at the provincial level. While her formal political role has diminished, and the Governor General has taken on more of the Head-of-State functions, the Monarch is still the constitutional head of Canada. Thus, government business, laws and the calling of elections are done or proclaimed in the Sovereign's name. {{ref|forsey1}}

The current Queen, Queen Elizabeth II, has reigned as Canada's sovereign since [[February 6]], [[1952]], and she has been a far more visible monarch than any in the past, visiting Canada 21 times as Queen (and once as a Princess), more than any other Commonwealth Realm except the UK itself. {{ref|Her1}}

===Governor General===
[[Image:JeanSmile.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Michaëlle Jean]], [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]].]]
{{main|Governor General of Canada}}
While Queen Elizabeth II is currently Canada's [[sovereign]], the Queen's representative in Canada and ''de facto'' [[head of state]] is the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]. The Governor General is generally a retired politician, military leader, or other notable Canadian; the current Governor General is Her Excellency, the Right Honourable [[Michaëlle Jean]]. [http://news.gc.ca/cfmx/view/en/index.jsp?articleid=162519] 

The Governor General is formally appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and is a non-partisan figure who fulfills many ceremonial and symbolic roles including providing [[Royal Assent]] to [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]], reading the [[Speech from the Throne]], officially welcoming dignitaries of foreign countries, presenting honours such as the [[Order of Canada]], signing state documents, formally opening and ending sessions of Parliament, and [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving Parliament]] for an election. The Governor General is also the titular [[Commander in Chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the Canadian Armed Forces, though, this is only a symbolic role as all actions are done at the request of the prime minister and are never disobeyed. The position of Governor General also beholds considerable reserve powers, but these have been rarely used. The Governor General also heads the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].

===Executive===
[[Image:Harpes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Stephen Harper]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].]]
The position of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], Canada's [[head of government]], in practice, belongs to the leader of the political party who can command a majority in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The Prime Minister and his or her cabinet are formally appointed by the Governor General. However, the Prime Minister chooses the cabinet and the Governor General always, by convention, respects the Prime Minister's desired choices. The [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the prime minister's party in both legislative houses, though mostly from the Commons. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the [[Privy Council of Canada]] and become ministers of the Crown. The Prime Minister exercises a great deal of individual political power, especially in the appointment of other officials within the government and [[civil service]]. [[Stephen Harper]], a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]], has served as Prime Minister since [[February 6]], [[2006]].

===Legislature===
The legislative branch of government has two houses: the elected House of Commons and the appointed [[Canadian Senate|Senate]].  Each member in the Commons is elected by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]] in one riding or [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]]; general elections are called by the Governor General when the prime minister so advises, and must occur every five years or less. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the prime minister and formally appointed by the Governor General, and serve until age 75.

====Federal political parties====
Canada has four main political parties today. The traditionally centrist / left-of-centre [[Liberal Party of Canada]] formed the government in Canada for most of the 20th century.

The only other parties to have formed a government have been incarnations of a centrist / right-of-centre conservative party.  The current government is formed by the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], established in 2003 from a merger of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative (PC) Party]], and the [[Canadian Alliance]]. The Progressive Conservative party has formed governments in the past, as did its predecessor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]], which was the dominant political party in the 19th century.  A single-term [[Unionist Party (Canada)|'Unionist' Party]] of [[Robert Borden]] was formed as a union of Conservatives and conscription-supporting Liberals during [[World War I]].

The [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) is the major party furthest to the political left and espouses [[social democratic]] policies. The [[Bloc Québécois]] promotes [[Quebec independence]] from Canada and currently holds a majority of Quebec's seats in the House of Commons. There are many smaller parties and, while none have current representation in Parliament, the list of [[List of political parties in Canada#Historical parties that have won seats in Parliament|historical parties with elected representation]] is substantial.

===Judiciary===
[[Image:Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in Ottawa, beside Parliament Hill]]
Canada's [[judiciary]] plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down laws that violate the constitution.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court and final arbiter; its nine members are directly appointed by Cabinet.  All judges at the superior and appellate levels are selected and appointed by the federal government, after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies.  The federal cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts at the provincial and territorial levels.  Judicial posts at the lower provincial and territorial levels are filled by their respective governments (see [[Court system of Canada]] for more detail).

[[Common law]] prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] predominates. Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is a provincial responsibility, but in most provinces policing is contracted to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).

===بهرنۍ اړيکې===
{{main|د کاناډا بهرنۍ اړيکې}}
Canada has a close [[U.S.-Canada relations|relationship with the United States]], sharing the world's longest undefended border, co-operating on some military campaigns and exercises, and being each other's largest trading partners. Canada also shares a history and long relationship with the [[United Kingdom]] as its "mother country."

In the last century, Canada has been an advocate for [[multilateralism]], making efforts to reach out to the rest of the world.  This was clearly demonstrated during the [[Suez Crisis]] when [[Lester B. Pearson]] mollified the tension by proposing [[peacekeeping]] efforts and the inception of the [[UN peacekeeping|United Nations Peacekeeping Force]]. In that spirit, Canada developed and has tried to maintain a leading role in [[peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping efforts]]. Canada has cumulatively contributed more troops to peacekeeping operations worldwide than all other nations combined and currently serves in over 40 different peacekeeping missions, most recently in [[Afghanistan]].

[[Image:Canadian soldiers afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Canadian soldiers in [[Afghanistan]].]]
:''Main articles: [[Canadian Armed Forces]],[[Military history of Canada]]''
A founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), Canada currently employs about 62,000 regular and 26,000 reserve military personnel.[http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/about/family_e.asp] The unified [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian Forces]] (CF) comprise the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|army]], [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|navy]], and [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]].  Major CF equipment deployed includes 2,400 armoured fighting vehicles, 34 combat vessels, and 140 combat aircraft. 

Canadian forces have served in various wars including the [[Second Boer War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]] and recently, in [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].  Since [[Lester B. Pearson]] proposed the first [[United Nations|UN]] peacekeeping force in 1956, the Canadian Forces have served in 42 [[peacekeeping|peacekeeping missions]] &mdash; more than any other country.  Battles significantly contributing to Canada's development and self-identity include the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], and [[Juno Beach]]. At the end of World War II, Canada was the fourth strongest military power in the world, behind the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

Currently, CF personnel are involved in the [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO mission in Afghanistan]].  Smaller missions are also taking place in [[Haiti]] and [[Kosovo]].  Canada's [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) has participated in two relief operations in the last year.  The two-hundred member relief crew helped in [[Southeast Asia]] after the [[2004 tsunami|December 2004 tsunami]], and DART was also deployed in response to the devastating earthquake that [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|struck]] the [[Kashmir]] region in [[South Asia]] in October 2005.

==Provinces and territories==
[[Image:Map_Canada_political.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A political map of Canada, exhibiting its 13 first-order [[subnational entity|subnational divisions]].]]
{{main|Provinces and territories of Canada}}
Canada is composed of ten provinces and three territories. The provinces have a large degree of autonomy from the federal government, the territories somewhat less. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]].

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. The federal government can initiate national policies that the provinces can opt out of, but this rarely happens in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.

All provinces have unicameral, elected legislatures headed by a [[premier (Canada)|Premier]] selected in the same way as the Prime Minister of Canada. Each province also has a [[Lieutenant-Governor]] representing the Queen, analogous to the Governor General of Canada, appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, though with increasing levels of consultation with provincial governments in recent years. The provinces and territories are:

{{main|د کاناډا جغرافيه}}
Canada occupies the northern portion of [[North America]]. It shares land borders with the [[contiguous United States]] to the south and with [[Alaska]] to the northwest, stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west; to the north lies the [[Arctic Ocean]].  Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60° and 141° W [[longitude]] ([http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1]); this claim is not universally recognized. The northernmost settlement in Canada (and in the world) is [[CFS Alert|Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert]] on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]] – latitude 82.5° N – just 834 kilometres (450 [[nautical mile]]s) from the North Pole.  Canada is the world's second-largest country in total area, after [[Russia]].  

The population density of 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1/[[square mile|mi²]]) is among the lowest in the world.  The most densely populated part of the country is the [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]] in the southeast.  To the north of this region is the broad [[Canadian Shield]], an area of rock scoured clean by the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]], thinly soiled, rich in minerals, and dotted with lakes and rivers — more than 60% of the world's lakes are in Canada.

[[Newfoundland]] is at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest [[estuary]]. The [[Canadian Maritimes]] protrude eastward from the southern coasts of Quebec.  [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from [[British Columbia]].

[[Image:MountLogan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Mount Logan]] in [[Yukon]]; at 5,959 metres (19,551 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), Canada's highest point and second highest in North America.]]Northern Canadian vegetation tapers from [[coniferous]] forests to [[tundra]] and finally to Arctic barrens in the far north. The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic islands|archipelago]] containing some of the world's largest islands.

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada range depending on the location.
Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the Prairie provinces where daily average temperatures are near -15 °[[Celsius|C]] (5 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) Coastal British Columbia is an exception and it enjoys a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter. 

Average summer high temperatures across Canada range depending on the location.  On the east and west coast average high temperatures are in the low 20s °C (68-74°F), while in between the coasts the average summer high temperature range between 25°C to 30°C (78-86°F).

==اقتصاد==

:''Main articles: [[د کاناډا اقتصاد]], [[Economic history of Canada]]
An affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards. In the last century, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada has vast deposits of natural gas on the east coast and in the west, and a plethora of other natural resources contributing to self-sufficiency in energy. The 1989 [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) and 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the U.S. Since 2001, Canada has successfully avoided economic recession and has maintained the best overall economic performance in the [[G8]].

==Demographics==
:''Main articles: [[Demographics of Canada]], [[List of Canadians by ethnicity]]
The [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 national census]] recorded 30,007,094 people; as of January 2006, the population is estimated by [[Statistics Canada]] to be 32.4 million people[http://www.statcan.ca/english/edu/clock/population.htm], an increase of some 2.4 million people accomplished largely by [[immigration]] and (to a lesser extent) natural growth. About three-quarters of Canada's population live within 150 kilometres (95&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of the U.S. border. A similar proportion live in [[Urban Area|urban areas]] concentrated in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor (notably the [[Toronto]]-[[Hamilton]], [[Montréal]], and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa]] [[metropolitan area]]s), the BC [[Lower Mainland]], and the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] in Alberta.

[[Image:Cntower3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] is one of the world's most multicultural cities.]]
Canada is a very ethnically diverse nation. According to the 2001 census by [[Statcan]] it has 34 ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each, and numerous others represented in smaller amounts. A majority of Canadians descend from [[white]] [[Europe]]an immigrants who arrived in increasing numbers until WWI.  This majority--86.9% in 2001, is growing slower than the rest of the population. The most frequently stated [[white]] [[European]] ancestries are [[England|English]] (19.2%), [[France|French]] (15.7%), [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (14%), [[Irish]] (12.9%), [[German people|German]] (9.0%), and [[Italian people|Italian]] (4.3%)[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm]. 

Throughout and since the [[world war]]s, [[immigration]] to Canada has fluctuated somewhat but become more heterogeneous in makeup.  In 2001, 13.4% of the population belonged to visible minorities: most numerous among these are [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (3.5% of the population), [[Indo-Canadian|South Asian]] (3.1%), [[Black Canadian|Black]] (2.2%), and [[Filipino Canadian|Filipino]] (1.0%).

===Aboriginal peoples===
{{main|Aboriginal peoples in Canada}}
The [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution Act of 1982]] recognizes three groups of [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]]: the "Indians" (their legal designation, but now usually called [[First Nations]]), [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]. The aboriginal population is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the population in Canada. According to the [[Canada 2001 Census]], people identified themselves as aboriginal numbered 976,305 people (or 3.3% of Canada's population) of whom about 62% are First Nations, 30% are Métis, and 5% are Inuit.

===مذهب===
{{main|د کاناډا مذهب}}
According to the last census [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a.htm]77.1% of Canadians identified as being [[Christianity|Christians]]; of this, [[Catholicism|Catholics]] make up the largest group – 43.6% of Canadians. About 17% of Canadians declared no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity such as [[Sikhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]].

==ژبې==
[[Image:Montreal-Place Vauquelin, Note.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] sign in [[Quebec]]. Bilingualism is a defining feature of Canada's culture.]]
:''Main articles: [[د کاناډا ژبې]], [[Bilingualism in Canada]]''
Canada's two official languages are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], spoken by  56.3% and 28.7% of the population respectively.  On [[July 7]], [[1969]], under the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], French was made commensurate to English throughout the federal government. This started a process that led to Canada redefining itself as a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation.

English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions.
The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. While multiculturalism is official policy, to ''become'' a citizen one must be able to speak either English or French and more than 98% of Canadians speak English or French or both.  While the nation remains officially bilingual, the majority of Canadians are fluent only in English. 

French is mostly spoken in [[Quebec]] with pockets in [[New Brunswick]], eastern and northern [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], the south shore of [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[Manitoba]]. Of those who speak French as a [[first language]], 85% live in Quebec. 

Several [[Canada#Aboriginal peoples|aboriginal]] languages have official status in [[Northwest Territories]]. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in [[Nunavut]] and has official status there.
Non-official languages are also important in Canada, with 5,470,820 people listing a non-official language as a first language. (The above three statistics include those who listed more than one first language.) Among the most important non-official first language groups are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi]] (271,220).

==کلتور/فرهڼ==
[[Image:OttawaRCMP02.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] are the federal and national police force of Canada and an international icon.  On [[Canada Day]] (the national holiday) annually, they perform the Musical Ride on [[Parliament Hill]].]]
:''Main articles: [[د کاناډا کلتور/فرهڼ]], [[Canadian identity]]''
Due to its colonial past, Canadian culture has historically been heavily influenced by English, French, Irish and Scottish cultures and traditions. In more modern times, Canadian culture is now greatly influenced by American culture, due to the proximity and the migration of people, ideas, and capital. 

Many American movies, authors, TV shows, and [[List of Canadian musicians|musicians]] are equally popular in Canada (and vice versa), many have been successful worldwide. Most cultural products of these types are now increasingly marketed toward a unified "North American" market, and not specifically a Canadian or American one.

Amidst this large American cultural presence, which has prompted some fears of a "cultural takeover", a more robust and distinct Canadian culture with unique characteristics has developed in recent years due to a focus by the federal government on programs, laws and institutions to support culture and the arts, including the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], the [[National Film Board of Canada]], and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]]. 

Many Canadian citizens see Canadian culture as based on the policy of [[multiculturalism]], while others see it as based on a predominantly [[British culture|British]] and [[French culture|French]] core, with [[American culture|American]] and new immigrant influences and modifications.

===Sports===
[[Image:Hockey goal cmd 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ice hockey events are popular in Canada.  [[Ice hockey]] originated in Canada when residents began playing [[Shinty]] on ice.]]
{{main|Sport in Canada}}
Canada's official national sports are [[ice hockey]] (winter) and [[lacrosse]] (summer), however, hockey is considerably more a part of Canadian culture, and is by far the most popular spectator sport in the country.  Canada's six  [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] have franchises in the [[National Hockey League]], and there are more Canadian players in the league than from all other countries combined.  The three major junior leagues that together comprise the [[Canadian Hockey League]] have a combined total of 49 teams in Canadian towns or cities, from all 10 provinces.  There are also strong women's leagues across the country

[[Curling]] is another extremely popular winter sport in Canada, with the strongest support in the prairie provinces.  At the international level, Canada has dominated the sport of curling, with 29 out of 46 Men's [[List of World Curling Men's Champions|World Curling Championship]]s won by Canada.  Additionally, 13 out of 27 Women's World Curling Championships have gone to the Canadian side. 

[[Canadian football]], like [[American football]], is a descendant from [[rugby football]] but evolved differently and has unique rules.  The nine team [[Canadian Football League]] is the top league of the sport, and the annual [[Grey Cup]] championship game is viewed by a large television audience. Traditional [[association football|football]] (soccer) is widely popular in youth, interscholastic, and senior leagues but not at the professional level as it is in Europe or Latin America. 

As the vast majority of Canadians live in very close proximity to the [[United States]], Canadians can also watch sporting events from the professional leagues in that country, such as [[NASCAR]] and the [[National Football League]]. The NHL and the [[National Lacrosse League]] are comprised of teams from both Canada and the United States, and [[Toronto]] currently has franchises in [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Basketball Association]].  Other notable participatory sports which are enjoyed throughout Canada include [[skating]], [[skiing]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], [[swimming]], [[baseball]] and [[softball]].

===National symbols===
[[Image:Maple leaf.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The maple leaf is the characteristic [[leaf]] of the [[maple tree]], and is an important [[national symbol]] of Canada.]]
The use of the [[maple leaf]] as a Canadian symbol dates back to the early 18th century, and is depicted on its [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Red Ensign|previous]] flags, the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|coat of arms]].

The Crown appears on the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]] (displayed in many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SSC-Courtroom.jpg courtrooms] and [http://www.pm.gc.ca/ government websites]); the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]]; the [[Coat of arms of Quebec|Coat of Arms]] of many provinces as well as [[Nunavut]]; the badges of the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]], many [[The Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Regiments]], and [[Ontario Provincial Police|Police Forces]]; as well as some highway signs.  Also, the [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen's]] image appears in Canadian government buildings, military installations and schools; and on Canadian [[Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp (Canada)|stamps]], $20 [[Canadian dollar|notes]], and all coins.  

Canada is known for its vast forests and mountain ranges, and the animals that reside within them, such as [[moose]], [[caribou]], [[beaver]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[grizzly bear]]s, [[Canada goose]] and the [[common loon]]. The [[beaver]]'s emblematic status originated from the fact much of Canada's early economic history was tied to the [[fur trade]].  Other products made from the country's natural resources, such as [[maple syrup]], are also strongly associated with Canadian identity.  

Additional national symbols the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and anything pertaining to [[ice hockey|hockey]], Canada's official winter sport, which is often used as a national symbol of unity and pride. 

In recent years, other symbols have become a source of pride: notably, the ''[[I am Canadian]]'' campaign by [[Molson]], most notably the commercial featuring [[Joe Canada]], infused [[Canadian beer|home-grown beer]] with nationalism. The Canadian fashion retailer [[Roots Canada Ltd.|Roots]] also sells a variety of merchandise designed to evoke nationalistic sentiment.

==Holidays==
{{main|Holidays in Canada}}
Statutory and major holidays in Canada include [[New Year's Day]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]] [[Easter Monday|Monday]], [[Victoria Day]], [[Canada Day]], [[Labour Day]], [[Thanksgiving]], [[Remembrance Day]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]].

Canada's provinces and territories generally adopt statutory holidays similar to federal ones with some variations (including [[civic holiday]]s), and many Canadians celebrate numerous unofficial and religious holidays as well.
