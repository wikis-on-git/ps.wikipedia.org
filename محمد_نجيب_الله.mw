Dr. <b>Mohammad Najibullah</b> ([[1947]]&ndash;[[September 27]], [[1996]]) was the fourth and last President of [[Afghanistan]] during the period of the communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. He is also considered the 2nd President of the '''Republic of Afghanistan'''.

Najibullah's achievements as a mediator between factions, an effective diplomat, a clever foe, a resourceful administrator and a brilliant spokesman who coped with constant and changing turmoil throughout his six years as head of government, qualified him as a leader among Afghans. 

He downplayed Marxist ideology of the [[PDPA]] and annulled most of the early radical ''reforms'' of the '''Saur Revolution'''. His regime collapsed under the pressure of Islamic militants while it still possessed military superiority.

Najibullah was born in [[Kabul]] of a Ahmadzai Ghilzai [[Pashtun]] family. He was educated at Habibia High School and [[Kabul University]], where he graduated with a degree in Medicine in [[1975]]. 

He joined the [[Parcham]] faction of the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) in [[1965]].  Despite being regarded as an intelligent man, he was referred to as ''Najib-e Gaw'' (the Bull) by his opponents due to his physique.  The PDPA staged a successful coup in [[1978]], but the [[Khalq]] faction of the PDPA gained supremacy, and after a brief stint as ambassador in [[Tehran]], Najibullah was dismissed from government and went into exile in Europe.

In 1977 he joined the [[Central Committee]], and in 1978 the '''Revolutionary Council'''. After the Khalqis pressured the Parchamis, the former banished him to [[Iran]] as ambassador. Soon it dismissed him and deprived him of Afghan citizenship.

He returned to Kabul after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion in [[1979]]. In [[1980]], he was appointed the head of [[KHAD]], the secret police.  Under Najibullah's control, it is claimed that KHAD arrested, tortured and executed tens of thousands of Afghans. In 1981 he was promoted to full membership in the [[Politburo]]

Meanwhile, a change had taken place in Kabul. On May 4, 1986, Karmal resigned as secretary general of the PDPA and was replaced by Najibullah. Karmal retained the presidency for a while, but power had shifted to Najibullah

His selection by the Soviets was clearly related to his success in running KHAD, the secret police, more effectively than the rest of the DRA had been governed.

In November 1986, Najibullah was elected president and a new constitution was adopted. Some of the innovations incorporated into the constitution were a multi-party political system, freedom of expression, and an [[Islamic]] legal system presided over by an independent judiciary. 

However, all of these measures were largely outweighed by the broad powers of the president, who commanded a military and police apparatus under the control of the '''Homeland Party''' (Hizb-i Watan, as the PDPA became known in 1988). In September he set up the '''National Compromise Commission''' to contact counter-revolutionaries "in order to complete the '''Saur Revolution''' in its new phase." Allegedly some 40,000 rebels were contacted. 

In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching [[Moscow]]'s moves toward withdrawal. On [[July 20]], [[1987]], the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced.. 

It was also during his Administration that the peak of the fighting came in 1985-86. The Soviet forces launched their largest and most effective assaults on the mujahedin supply lines adjacent to [[Pakistan]]. Major campaigns had also forced the mujahedin into the defensive near [[Herat]] and [[Kandahar]].

Najibullah made an expanded reconciliation offer to the resistance in July, 1987 including twenty seats in State (formerly Revolutionary) Council, twelve ministries and a possible prime minister-ship and Afghanistan's status as an Islamic non-aligned state. Military, police, and security powers were not mentioned. 

The offer still fell far short of what even the moderate mujahedin parties would accept.

Najibullah then reorganized his government to face the mujahedin alone. A new constitution took effect in November, 1987. The name of the country was reverted to the '''Republic of Afghanistan''', the '''State Council''' was replaced by a '''National Assembly''' for which "progressive parties" could freely compete. [[Mir Hussein Sharq]], a non-party politician, was named Prime Minister.

On June 7, 1988, President Najibullah addressed the [[UN General Assembly]] for peace solution of crisis in Afghanistan.

[[Image:Najibullah.jpg|thumb|right|<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">ډاکټر نجيب الله د روسانو د وتلو نه وروسته د افغانستان ملي جرګې ته د وينا پر مهال.]]

Immediately after the Soviet departure, '''Najibullah''' pulled down the façade of shared government. He declared an emergency, removed Sharq and the other non-party ministers from the cabinet. The Soviet Union responded with a flood of military and economic supplies. Sufficient food and fuel were made available for the next two difficult winters. 

Much of the military equipment belonging to Soviet units evacuating [[Eastern Europe]] was shipped to Afghanistan. Assured adequate supplies, the '''Afghan Air Force''', which had developed tactics minimizing the threat from Stinger missiles, now deterred mass attacks against the cities. Medium-range missiles, particularly the [[Scud]], were successfully launched from Kabul in the defense of [[Jalalabad]], 145 kilometres miles away. 

Victory at '''Jalalabad''' dramatically revived the morale of the Kabul government. Its army proved able to fight effectively alongside the already hardened troops of the [[Soviet]]-trained special security forces. Defections decreased dramatically when it became apparent that the resistance was in disarray, with no capability for a quick victory.

Soviet support reached a value of $3 billion a year in 1990. Kabul had achieved a stalemate which exposed the mujahedin's weaknesses, political and military. Najibullah's government survived for another two years. Eventually divisions within his own ranks, including the defection of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]] fatally weakened the government's resolve. 

In March 1990, his Government successfully withstood a [[Khalq]]i coup, headed by Defense Minister [[Shahnawaz Tanai]]. [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] was one of the main supporters of the coup.

Najibullah had been working on a compromise settlement to end the civil war with Ahmad Shah Masood, brokered by the [[United Nations]]. But talks broke down and the government fell, and by [[1992]] Najibullah agreed to step down in favor of a transitional government. He also announced that a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] would be established "within a few month," on the basis of "free and democratic elections."

The regime collapsed while it still possessed material superiority. Its stockpiles of munitions and planes would provide the victorious mujahedin with the means of waging years of highly destructive war. [[Kabul]] was short of fuel and food at the end of winter in 1992. 

Najibullah announced his willingness on [[March 18]] to resign in order to make way for a [[neutral]] interim government. On [[April 16]], having lost internal control, was forced to resign by his own ruling party, following the capture of the strategically important [[Bagram]] air-base and the nearby town of [[Charikar]], by the '''Jamiat-i Islami''' guerrilla group.

Najibullah tried to flee Kabul, but his departure was blocked by [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]]. On [[April 17]], he sought sanctuary in the UN compound in Kabul. President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani|Rabbani]] refused to let him leave the country, but made no attempt to arrest him. 

On the day [[Sarobi]] fell to the [[Taliban]], Najibullah sent a message to the [[United Nations]] in [[Islamabad]], asking them to arrange the evacuation of himself, his brother '''Shahpur Ahmadzai''' and some of his bodyguards, but UN did not respond due to [[Pakistan]]'s [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] interference in the process.

His wife Fatana and his three daughters had lived in exile in [[New Delhi]] since 1992. He spent the rest of his days in virtual detention, and remained there until [[September]] [[1996]] when the [[Taliban]] captured Kabul.

[[Ahmed Shah Massoud]], Commander-in-chief of President's [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] Army, sent one of his senior Generals to ask him to leave with the retreating government troops, promising safe passage to the north, but Najibullah refused. There is some speculation that he didn't want to flee with the [[Tajiks]] because he was afraid of the reaction between the Pashtuns.

Najibullah sent a last wireless message to the UN in Islamabad early in the evening, asking for help. But it was too late: a special [[Taliban]] unit of five men designated for the task (and believed to be led by [[Pakistan]]'s [[ISI]], responsible for the most turmoil in [[Afghanistan]]'s peace process), dragged Najibullah outside of the UN compound.

They tortured him and wanted him to sign papers related the [[Durand line]], then bundled his brother and him into a pick-up, and drove them to the Presidential Palace. They shot him there, together with his brother. Finally, the Taliban hanged the two bodies from a concrete traffic control post just outside the Palace where he criticized [[Pakistan]] for its role in [[Jalalabad]] war , only a few blocks from the UN compound.

Mullah [[Mohammad Rabbani]], designated '''Head of the Supreme Council''' in Kabul, proclaimed that Najibullah had being sentenced to death by the Taliban because he was a [[communist]] and a [[murderer]]. He also banned an Islamic funeral for the former President. 

There was widespread international condemnation, particularly from the [[Muslim]] world. Still, he is widely remembered by [[Pashtun]] [[nationalists]]. His body was removed and sent to [[Gardez]], his birthplace in [[Paktia]] Province. He was buried by his [[Ahmadzai]] tribesmen.
