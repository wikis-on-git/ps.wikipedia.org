The '''Kingdom of Morocco''' ([[Arabic]]: '''المملكة المغربية''') is a country in [[North Africa]]. It has a long coastline on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] that reaches past the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It borders [[الجېريا]] to the east, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[اسپانيا]] to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to its west. The border to the south is disputed. Morocco claims ownership of [[لوېديځه صحارا]] and has administered most of the territory since 1975.

Morocco, a [[constitutional monarchy]], is the only African country that is not currently a member of the [[African Union]]. However, it is a member of the [[Arab League]], [[Arab Maghreb Union]], [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]], [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] group, [[Group of 77]] and [[major non-NATO ally]].

== Name ==
For thousands of years, Moroccans called their land: '''Tamurt nnegh''' meaning simply: '''Our Land'''; and from which the term Mauritania was derived. The Romanians used "Mauritania" to name the Northwestern Africa. 
'''Al Maghrib''' (meaning in Arabic ''The West'') is currently commonly used too. The name '''Morocco''' in many other languages originates from the name of the former capital [[Marrakech]]. The Berber/Amazigh word '''Murakush''' means '''Land of God'''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Morocco}}
The area of modern Morocco has been inhabited since [[Neolithic|Neolithic times]], at least 8000 [[Anno Domini|BC]], as attested by signs of the [[Capsian culture]], in a time when the [[Maghreb]] was less arid than it is today. Many theorists believe the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] probably arrived at roughly the same time as agriculture (see [[Berber]]), and was adopted by the existing population as well as the immigrants that brought it. Modern genetic analyses have confirmed that various populations have contributed to the present-day population, including, in addition to the main ethnic groups - [[Berber]]s and [[Arab]]s - [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Sephardic]] [[Jew]]s, and [[sub-Sahara]]n [[Africa]]ns. The [[Berber]]s, often referred to in modern ethnic activist circles as "Amazigh," are more commonly known as Berber or by their regional ethnic identity, such as [[Chleuh]]. In the classical period Morocco was known as [[Mauretania]], although this should not be confused with the modern country of [[Mauritania]].

=== Roman and sub-Roman Morocco ===
North Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [[Mediterranean]] world by Phoenician trading colonies and settlements in the late Classical period. The arrival of Phoenicians heralded a long engagement with the wider [[Mediterranean]], as this strategic region formed part of the [[Roman Empire]], as [[Mauretania Tingitana]]. In the 5th century [[Anno Domini|AD]], as the Roman Empire declined, the region fell to the [[Vandal]]s, [[Visigoth]]s, and then [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greeks]] in rapid succession. During this time, however, the high mountains of most of modern Morocco remained unsubdued, and stayed in the hands of their Berber inhabitants.

===

=== Morocco 1666-1912 ===
The [[Alaouite Dynasty]] eventually gained control. Morocco was facing aggression from [[Spain]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] that was sweeping westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilizing their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region it remained quite wealthy. In 1684 they annexed [[Tangier]].

Morocco was the first nation, in 1777, to recognize the fledgling [[United States]] as an independent nation. In the beginning of the [[American Revolution]], American merchant ships were subject to attack by the [[Barbary Pirates]] while sailing the [[Atlantic ocean]]. At this time, American envoys tried to obtain protection from European powers but to no avail. On December 20, 1777, Morocco's Sultan declared that the American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage.

The [[Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship]] stands as the U.S.'s oldest non-broken friendship [[treaty]]. Signed by [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], it has been in continuous effect since 1786. After the organization of the American government under the Constitution, President George Washington wrote a letter, beginning with the words "Great and magnanimous friend", to the Sultan Sidi Mohamed strengthening the ties between the two countries. The United States legation (consulate) in Tangier is the first property the American government ever owned abroad. The building now houses the [[Tangier American Legation Museum]].

=== European influence ===
Successful [[Portugal|Portuguese]] efforts to control the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast in the [[15th century]] did not profoundly affect the Mediterranean heart of Morocco. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Egypt and the North African [[maghreb]] became increasingly ungovernable from [[Constantinople]], the resort of pirates under local [[bey]]s, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. [[France]] showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as [[1830]]. Recognition by the [[United Kingdom]] in [[1904]] of France's [[sphere of influence]] in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June [[1905]] was resolved at the [[Algeciras Conference]], [[Spain]] in [[1906]], which formalized France's "special position" and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A [[Agadir Crisis|second Moroccan crisis]] provoked by [[Berlin]], increased tensions between European powers. The [[Treaty of Fez]] (signed on [[March 30]], [[1912]]) made Morocco a [[protectorate]] of France. By the same treaty, [[Spain]] assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern [[Sahara]]n zones on [[November 27]] that year.

Many Moroccan soldiers ([[Goumiere]]s) who served in the [[French army]] assisted European and American troops in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

=== Resistance ===
Nationalist political parties, which subsequently arose under the French protectorate, based their arguments for Moroccan independence on such [[World War II]] declarations as the [[Atlantic Charter]] (a joint U.S.-British statement that set forth, among other things, the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they live). A manifesto of the [[Istiqlal Party]] (Independence party in English) in [[1944]] was one of the earliest public demands for independence. That party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.

France's [[exile]] of [[Sultan Mohammed V]] in [[1953]] to [[Madagascar]] and his replacement by the unpopular [[Mohammed Ben Aarafa]], whose reign was perceived as illegitimate, sparked active opposition to the French protectorate all over the country. The most notable occurred in [[Oujda]] where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets. Operations by the newly created "Armée de Libération", were launched on [[October 1]], [[1955]]. "L'Armée de Libération" was created by "Comité de Libération du Maghreb Arabe" (Arab Maghreb Liberation Committee) in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] to constitute a resistance movement against occupation like the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] in [[Algeria]]. Its goal was the return of King Mohammed V and the liberation of [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] as well. France allowed Mohammed V to return in [[1955]], and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.

All those events helped increase the degree of [[solidarity]] between the people and the newly returned king. For this reason, the revolution that Morocco knew was called "la révolution du Roi et du Peuple" (The revolution of the King and the People) and it is celebrated every [[August 20]].

=== Independence ===
Morocco recovered its political [[independence]] from France on [[March 2]], [[1956]] and on [[April 7]] of that year France officially relinquished its protectorate in Morocco. Through agreements with Spain in [[1956]] and [[1958]], Moroccan control over certain Spanish-ruled areas was restored, though attempts to claim other Spanish colonial possessions through [[1957 Invasion of Spanish Sahara|military action]] were less successful. The internationalized city of [[Tangier]] was reintegrated with the signing of the [[Tangier Protocol]] on [[October 29]], [[1956]] ''(see [[Tangier Crisis]])''. [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] became King of Morocco on [[March 3]], [[1961]]. His rule would be marked by political unrest, and the ruthless government response earned the name [[years of lead|"the years of lead"]]. The Spanish [[enclave]] of [[Ifni]] in the south became part of the new Morocco in [[1969]]. Morocco annexed [[Western Sahara]] during the [[1970s]], but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved. (See [[History of Western Sahara]].)

Tentative political reform in the [[1990s]] resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in [[1997]]. Morocco was granted [[Major non-NATO ally]] status in June 2004 and signed [[free trade agreement]]s with the United States and the European Union.

In [[2003]], Morocco's largest city, [[Casablanca Attacks|Casablanca suffered from terrorist attacks]]. The attacks were targeted against Western and Jewish places and left 33 civilians dead and more than 100 people injured, mostly Moroccans.

In [[2006]], Morocco celebrated its 50th anniversary of [[independence]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Morocco}}
Morocco is a ''[[de jure]]'' constitutional [[monarchy]], with an elected [[parliament]]. The [[King of Morocco]], with vast executive powers, can dissolve government and deploy the [[military of Morocco|military]], among other responsibilities. Opposition political parties are legal and several have arisen in recent years.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|Regions of Morocco}}
[[دوتنه:3 maps morocco.PNG|thumb|300px|Different maps used to illustrate the area of Morocco]]

Morocco is divided into 16 regions [http://www.statoids.com/uma.html]. As part of a 1997 decentralization/regionalization law passed by the legislature, 16 new regions were created. These 16 regions are:

Due to the conflict over [[Western Sahara]], the status of both regions of "Laâyoune-Boujdour-Sakia El Hamra" and "Oued Ed-Dahab-Lagouira" is disputed.

''See also [[List of cities in Morocco and Western Sahara]]''

[[Algeria]] borders Morocco to the east and southeast though the border between the two countries has been closed since [[1994]]. There are also four [[Spain|Spanish]] enclaves on the Mediterranean coast: [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]], [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]] and [[Peñón de Alhucemas]], as well as several islands including [[Isla Perejil|Perejil]] and [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarinas]]. Off the Atlantic coast the [[Canary Islands]] belong to [[Spain]], whereas [[Madeira]] to the north is [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. To the north, Morocco is bordered by and controls part of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], giving it power over the waterways in and out of the [[Mediterranean]] sea. The [[Rif|Rif mountains]] occupy the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The [[Atlas Mountains]] run down the backbone of the country, from the south west to the north east. Most of the south east portion of the country is in the [[Sahara Desert]] and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, while to the south is the desert. To the south lies the [[Western Sahara]], a former Spanish colony that was annexed by Morocco in 1975 (see [[Green March]]). Morocco claims that the Western Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its [[Southern Provinces]].

Morocco's capital city is [[Rabat]], and its largest city is the main port of [[Casablanca]].

Other cities include
[[Agadir]],
[[Essaouira]],
[[Fes]],
[[Marrakech]],
[[Meknes]],
[[Mohammadia]],
[[Oujda]],
[[Ouarzazat]],
[[Safi, Morocco|Safi]],
[[Salè]],
[[Tangier]],
[[Tiznit]],
[[Tan-Tan]].

=== Climate ===
The [[Mediterranean climate|climate is Mediterranean]], which becomes more extreme towards the interior regions where it is mountainous. The terrain is such that the coastal [[plain]]s are rich and accordingly, they comprise the backbone for [[agriculture]]. [[Forest]]s cover about 12% of the land while arable land accounts for 18%. 5% is irrigated.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Morocco}}
[[دوتنه:Bank in marocco.jpg|thumb|The [[Central bank]] of Morocco (Bank Al Maghrib)]]

Morocco has signed Free Trade Agreements with the [[European Union]] (to take effect 2010) and the [[United States of America]]. The United States Senate approved by a vote of 85 to 13 on July 22, 2004 the [[US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement]], which will allow for 98% of the two-way trade of consumer and industrial products to be without tariffs. The agreement entered into force in January 2006. 

Morocco's largest industry is the mining of [[phosphates]]. Its second largest source of income is from nationals living abroad who [[value transfer system|transfer money]] to relatives living in Morocco. The country's third largest source of revenue is [[tourism]].

Morocco ranks among the world’s largest producers and exporters of [[cannabis]], and its cultivation and sale provide the economic base for much of the population of northern Morocco. The cannabis is typically processed into [[hashish]]. This activity represents 0.57 per cent of Morocco's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated at US$ 37.3 billion. A UN survey<ref>[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2003/unisnar826.html Europe's Drug Consumption Stimulates Cannabis Cultivation in Morocco] UN Information Service</ref> estimated cannabis cultivation at about 1,340 square kilometres (515&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) in Morocco's five northern provinces. This represents 10 % of the total area and 27 per cent of the arable lands of the surveyed territory and 1.5 per cent of Morocco's total arable land. Morocco is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and in 1992 Morocco passed legislation designed to implement the Convention.

Morocco has an [[unemployment]] rate of 12.1% (2004 Data) and a 1999 estimate by the CIA puts 19% of the Moroccan population under the [[poverty line]]<ref>[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mo.html CIA World Factbook]</ref>.

Though working towards change, Morocco historically has utilized child labor on a large scale. In 1999 the Moroccan Government stated that over 500,000 children under the age of 15 were in the labor force<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/369753.stm Child labour rife in Morocco] BBC Online</ref>.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Morocco}}

Morocco is the fourth most populous Arab country, after [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]] and [[Algeria]]. Most Moroccans are [[Sunni]] Muslims of Arab, Berber, or mixed Arab-Berber stock. The Arabs invaded Morocco in the [[7th century]] and established their culture there. [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Morocco's Jewish minority]] has decreased significantly and numbers about 7,000 (See [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]). Most of the 100,000 foreign residents are French or Spanish; many are teachers or technicians and more and more retirees, especially in [[Marrakech]].

There is no significant [[genetics|genetic]] differences between Moroccan Arabs and Moroccan non-Arabs (ie Berbers and Saharawis). Thus, it is likely that [[Arabization]] was mainly a cultural process without genetic replacement.<ref>[http://www.upf.edu/cexs/recerca/bioevo/2000BioEvo/BE2000-Bosch-STRs-EJHG.pdf Genetic structure of north-west Africa revealed by STR analysis]</ref>. However, and according to the [[European Journal of Human Genetics]], North-Western [[Africa]]ns were genetically closer to [[Iberian]]s and to other [[Europe]]ans than to
[[African American]]s. <ref>European Journal of Human Genetics (2000) 8, 360–366</ref>.

Morocco's official language is [[classical Arabic]]. The country's distinctive Arabic dialect is called [[Moroccan Arabic]]. Approximately 12 million (40% of the population), mostly in [[rural area]]s, speak [[Berber language|Berber]] --which exists in Morocco in three different dialects ([[Tarifit]], [[Tashelhiyt]], and [[Tamazight]])-- either as a first language or bilingually with the spoken Arabic dialect. <ref>[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552010/Berber_(people).html Berber (people)] Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2006</ref> [[French language|French]], which remains Morocco's unofficial second language, is taught universally and still serves as Morocco's primary language of commerce and economics. It also is widely used in education and government. About 20,000 Moroccans in the northern part of the country speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as a second language in parallel with [[Tarifit]]. [[English language|English]], while still far behind French and Spanish in terms of number of speakers, is rapidly becoming the foreign language of choice among educated youth. As a result of national education reforms entering into force in late 2002, English will be taught in all public schools from the fourth year on.

Most people live west of the [[Atlas Mountains]], a range that insulates the country from the [[Sahara Desert]]. [[Casablanca]] is the center of commerce and industry and the leading port; [[Rabat]] is the seat of government; [[Tangier]] is the gateway to Morocco from [[Spain]] and also a major port; [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] is the cultural and religious center; and the dominantly "Berber" [[Marrakech]] is a major tourist center.

[[Education]] in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school (age 15). Nevertheless, many children --particularly girls in rural areas-- still do not attend school. The country's [[illiteracy]] rate has been stuck at around 50% for some years but reaches as high as 90% among girls in rural regions. Morocco has about 230,000 students enrolled in 14 public universities. In some ways the most prestigious is "Mohammed V University" in Rabat -along with [[Al Akhawayn University]] in [[Ifrane]] (a private university)-, with faculties of law, sciences, and liberal arts. Al-Akhawayn, founded in 1993 by King Hassan II and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, is an English-medium, American-style university comprising about 1,000 students. [[University of Al Karaouine]], in Fez, is the oldest university in the world and has been a center for knowledge for more than 1,000 years.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Morocco}}
[[دوتنه:King Hassan II Mosque 02.jpg|thumb|150px|King [[Hassan II Mosque]]]]

Morocco is an ethnically diverse country with a rich [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. Through [[History of Morocco|Moroccan history]], Morocco hosted many people coming from both East ([[Phoenicians]], [[Carthaginians]], [[Jews]] and [[Arabs]]), South ([[Africans]]) and North ([[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Moors]] and Jews). All those civilizations have had an impact on the social structure of Morocco. It conceived various forms of beliefs, from [[paganism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] to [[Islam]].

Each region possesses its own specificities, contributing, thus, to the making of national culture and to the [[civilization]] legacy. Morocco has set among its top priorities the protection of its legacy and the preservation of its cultural identity.

Ethnically and culturally speaking, Morocco nowadays can be considered the least Arabic among [[Arab]] countries. Most of its population are of [[Berber]] origins.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of Morocco}}

Moroccan cuisine has long been considered as one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. The reason is because of the interaction of Morocco with the outside world for centuries. The cuisine of Morocco is a mix of Berber, Moorish, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and African cuisines. The cuisine of Morocco has been influenced by the native [[Berber cuisine]], the Arabic Andalusian cuisine; brought by the [[Moriscos]] when they left Spain, the [[Turkish cuisine]] from the Turkish and the [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]s brought by the Arabs as well as the [[Jewish cuisine]].

[[Spices]] are used extensively in Moroccan food. While spices have been imported to Morocco for thousands of years, many ingredients, like [[saffron]] from Tiliouine, [[mint]] and [[olive]]s from Meknes, and [[orange]]s and [[lemon]]s from Fez, are home-grown. [[Chicken]] is the most widely eaten meat in Morocco. The most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco is [[beef]] although [[lamb]] is preferred while being relatively expensive. [[Couscous]] is the most famous Moroccan dish along with [[pastilla]], [[tajine]], and [[harira]]. The most popular drink is [[green tea]] with mint. The tea is accompanied with hard sugar cones or lumps.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Literature of Morocco}}

Moroccan literature is written in Arabic, Berber or French, and particularly by people of Morocco. It also contains literature produced in [[Al-Andalus]]. Under the [[Almohad]] dynasty Morocco experienced a period of prosperity and brilliance of learning. The Almohad built the Marrakech Kutubiya Mosque, which accommodated no less than 25,000 people, but was also famed for its books, manuscripts, libraries and book shops, which gave it its name; the first book bazaar in history. The Almohad Caliph Abu Yakub had a great love for collecting books. He founded a great library, which was eventually carried to the Casbah and turned into a public library. Modern Moroccan literature began in the [[1930s]]. Two main factors gave Morocco a pulse toward witnessing the birth of a modern literature. Morocco, as a French and Spanish protectorate left Moroccan intellectuals the opportunity to exchange and to produce literary works freely enjoying the contact of other [[Arabic literature]] and Europe.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Morocco}}

Moroccan music is predominantly Arab, but [[Andalusian]] and other imported influences have had a major effect on the country's musical character. Rock-influenced [[chaabi]] bands are widespread, as is [[trance music]] with historical origins in [[Muslim music]].

Morocco is home to [[Andalusian classical music]] that is found throughout North Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in [[Cordoba]], and the Persian-born musician [[Ziryab]] is usually credited with its invention.

There are three varieties of Berber folk music: village and ritual music, and the music performed by professional musicians.

Chaabi (''popular'') is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.
