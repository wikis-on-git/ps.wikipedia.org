{{this|the country of Europe|Macedonia}}

The '''Republic of Macedonia''' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''Република Македонија''), or '''Macedonia'''<sup>[[#Naming dispute|*]]</sup>, is an independent state on the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] in southeastern [[Europe]]. The country borders [[سربيا]],  Montenegro]] to the north]], [[البانيا]] to the west, [[يونان]] to the south, and [[بلغاريه/بلغارستان]] to the east. 

The capital is [[Skopje]] with more than 600,000 inhabitants. It has a number of smaller cities, notably [[Bitola]], [[Prilep]], [[Tetovo]], [[Kumanovo]], [[Ohrid]], [[Veles]], [[Stip]], and [[Strumica]].

The Republic of Macedonia is often called ''a land of lakes and mountains''. There are more than 50 natural and artificial lakes and sixteen mountain ranges higher than 2000 metres above [[sea level]]. 

The country is member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[Council of Europe]], associate member of [[La Francophonie]], [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], since December 2005 it is a candidate for joining the [[European Union]], and is also expecting [[NATO]] membership.

:''Main article: [[History of the Republic of Macedonia]]''
The lands governed by the Republic of Macedonia were previously the southernmost part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Its current borders were fixed shortly after [[World War II]] when the government of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] established the ''Socialist Republic of Macedonia'', recognizing the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] as a separate nation within Yugoslavia. 

In the past, these lands came under a number of ancient states and former empires; [[Paionia]], the kingdom of ancient [[Macedon]] (which gave its name to the whole Macedonian region). It must be noted though,that the ancient kingdom of [[Macedon]] was centered in what is known today as [[Greek Macedonia]] and its boundaries did not exceed the town [[Bitola]][http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/farg/harry/geo/maced.htm].Later the area became part of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires, and the medieval [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Serbia]]n states. In the [[14th]] century the region was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Following the two [[Balkan wars]] of [[1912]] and [[1913]] and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the wider region of Macedonia was divided between [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]]. The territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia was then known as ''Južna Srbija'', "Southern Serbia", but had no separate or autonomous identity at the time. After the [[First World War]] Serbia joined the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In [[1929]], the kingdom was officially renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and divided into provinces called [[banovina]]s. Southern Serbia, including all of what is now the Republic of Macedonia, became a part of the [[Vardar Banovina]].

In 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis Powers]] and the Vardar Banovina was divided between its neighbors, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Italy|Italian]]-occupied [[Albania]]. Harsh rule by the occupying forces encouraged many Macedonians to support the Communist [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] resistance movement of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the end of the [[Second World War]], when Tito became Yugoslavia's president, the ''People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'' was established. The ''People's Republic of Macedonia'' became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in [[1963]], the People's Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed, becoming the ''Socialist Republic of Macedonia''. It dropped the "Socialist" from its name in [[1991]] when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.  A few very minor changes to its border with Serbia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. 

The country officially celebrates [[8 September]] [[1991]] as Independence day, with regard to the referendum by registered voters endorsing independence from Yugoslavia. The Republic of Macedonia remained at peace through the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the early [[1990s]] but was destabilized by the [[Kosovo War]] in [[1999]], when an estimated 360,000 [[Albanians|ethnic Albanian]] refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country. Although they departed shortly after the war, soon after, [[Macedonian NLA|Albanian radicals]] on both sides of the border took up arms in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian-populated areas of the Republic. A [[Macedonian War|short war]] was fought between government and ethnic Albanian rebels, mostly in the north and west of the country, in March-June [[2001]]. This war ended with the intervention of a [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] ceasefire monitoring force. The government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority. The Albanian side agreed to give up any separatist demands and to fully recognise all Macedonian istitutions. In addition, according to this accord the NLA was to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force. In 2005, Macedonia was officially recognized as a [[European Union]] candidate nation.

== Politics ==
:''Main article: [[Politics of the Republic of Macedonia]]'' 
The president is Branko Crvenkovski. Republic of Macedonia is a [[parliamentary democracy]] with an executive government composed of a coalition of parties from the unicameral legislature (''Собрание'', ''Sobranie''), and an independent judicial branch with a constitutional court. The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years.

The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the President of the Government.  The President is the commander-in-chief of the state armed forces and a president of the state Security Council. The President of the Republic is elected every five years and  she/he can be elected twice at most.

With the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities (''општини'', ''opštini''; singular - ''општина'', ''opština''). The capital, Skopje, is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as "the City of Skopje".  Municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia are units of local self-government.  There is a possibility to establish collaboration between neighbouring municipalities.

Judiciary power is exercised by courts and the most important ones are: the Judicial Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and the Republican Judicial Council.  The assembly appoints the judges.

The country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically-based political parties representing the country's Slav majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in [[2001]], following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, the Republic's parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.

=== International relations ===
:''Main article: [[Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia]]'' 

Republic of Macedonia is a member of a number of international organisations such as the [[United Nations]], [[Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] [[Council of Europe]], associate member of [[La Francophonie]], [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) etc.  It is seeking to join [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], although its accession to either is unlikely to occur before [[2008]] and [[2012]], respectively. In December 2005, the leaders of the EU formally named it as a [[Enlargement of the European Union|candidate country]] but did not set a date for starting entry talks.

The United States Agency for International Development has underwritten a project called Macedonia Connects which has made the Republic of Macedonia the first all broadband wireless country its size or larger in the world. The Ministry of Education and Sciences reports that 461 schools (primary and secondary) are now connected to the internet. In addition, the Internet Service Provider named On.net has created a MESH Network to provide WIFI services in the 11 largest cities/towns in the country.

=== Naming dispute ===
:''Further information: [[Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia#Naming issue|Naming issue]]''

[[دوتنه:Flag_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia_1992-1995.svg|thumb|180 px|The Republic of Macedonia's first flag, the subject of a dispute with Greece between 1992-1995]]The Republic of Macedonia is commonly referred to as 'Macedonia', but the name is also used to designate the wider [[Macedonia (region)|geographical region of Macedonia]] or the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek region of Macedonia]]. Due to a [[Foreign relations of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia#Greece|dispute between the governments]] of the Republic of Macedonia and Greece over the name, the [[United Nations]] agreed to refer to the country as "the '''former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'''" ('''FYROM''') (in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''Поранешна Југословенска Република Македонија'' (''ПЈРМ'')) when it became a member state in 1993.[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r225.htm]  Most international organizations adopted the same convention, including the [[European Union]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[International Olympic Committee]], among others.  The two countries also engaged in a dispute over the republic's first flag, which incorporated the [[Vergina Sun]] symbol, claimed by Greece as representing the historical [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek province of Macedonia]]. Its adoption by Skopje, on 3 July 1992, was seen as a reaction to Athens' pressure to change the name. This aspect of the dispute was resolved after an interim accord between the two states, when the flag was changed by an act of parliament, in October 1995.

Nonetheless, the name dispute has not prevented Greece and the Republic of Macedonia from engaging in military and security co-operation, cross-border investments, and cultural exchanges. The November 2005 [[European Commission]] report states that, "Relations with Greece have improved in the last few years. [[Greece]] is the most important investor in the country (57% of the total foreign investments) and trade has been constantly increasing."

=== European Union candidacy and membership ===

As part of [[enlargement of the European Union|ongoing efforts to expand its membership]], the [[European Union]] (EU) granted Macedonia candidate status on [[17 December]] [[2005]], but with no promise of when such negotiations could start.  [[France]] had made a budget deal as a condition for granting Macedonia candidate status and Greece agreed not to veto the decision on the premise that the name dispute will be resolved.  Macedonia applied for full membership on [[22 March]] [[2004]]. Macedonian Prime Minister [[Vlado Bučkovski]] hailed the decision as a "one-way ticket" to the EU for his country and stated: "Macedonia finally leaves the Balkan road paved with cobblestones and joins a highway that leads to Europe".

According to the EU, namely in accordance with its [[Copenhagen criteria]], the main obstacles towards eventual EU membership for Republic of Macedonia concern good relations with  neighbouring countries and reforms to its judicial and police systems.  Also, growth rate lags behind that of most EU members, unemployment is high, and foreign investment is relatively low.  The [[decentralisation]] process imposed after the six-month conflict in 2001 still requires full implementation.  However, the relatively low population and European characteristics of the country promise few strains on the EU budget.

In February 2006, the Republic became the fourth member of Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), joining Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. CEFTA acts as 'sandbox' to encourage joint efforts for the integration of participating countries in Western European institutions  and look for opportunities for close economic and political co-operation.

=== '''Election irregularities''' ===
According to the OSCE/ODIHR report [http://www.osce.org/skopje/item_1_18068.html]on the March and April 2005 vote, "during all rounds, group voting and proxy voting remained quite widespread, in particular in western and northwestern areas of the country, where women were effectively disenfranchised. This trend disproportionately affected women in minority communities," The report emphasized that such voting practices "should be strongly discouraged". This problem [http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/articles/2006/02/21/reportage-01] seems to prevail within the patriarchal family traditions in predominantly Muslim parts of the country. Another serious problem concerns the approximately 150,000 registered voters who live abroad. They are eligible to vote, but only if they come back to Macedonia to do so. In previous elections, the losing parties and candidates have routinely claimed the expatriate voting process is riddled with fraud.

== Geography ==
:''Main article: [[Geography of the Republic of Macedonia]]
[[دوتنه:Mk-map.png|thumb|350px|Map of the Republic of Macedonia]]
[[دوتنه:Macedonia.JPG|thumb|170px|Satellite view of Macedonia]]

A [[landlocked]] country, the Republic of Macedonia encompasses only a part of the wider [[Macedonia (region)|geographical region of Macedonia]] in the [[Balkans]].  The remainder is divided between neighbouring [[Greece]] (with about [[Macedonia (Greece)|half of the total]]), [[Bulgaria]] (with [[Pirin Macedonia|under a tenth]]), and [[Albania]].

Macedonia's terrain is mostly rugged, located between the [[Sar mountain|Šar]] and [[Rhodope mountains|Rhodope]] mountains around the valley of the [[Vardar]] river.  Three large lakes - [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Dojran Lake]] - lie on the southern borders of the Republic, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece.   The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in [[1963]] when [[Skopje]] was heavily damaged by a major earthquake.

The Republic of Macedonia also has scenic mountains. They are belong to two different ranges: Dinarska and Rodopska. The mountains belonging to the Dinarska range are older with subsequent erosion;  the Rodopska range is younger offering rugged, alpine sceneries.
Ten highest mountains in the Republic of Macedonia:
* [[Mount Korab]]    (2,764 m)
* [[Sar Mountain]]   (2,747 m)
* [[Baba Mountain]]  (2,601 m)
* [[Jakupica]]       (2,540 m)
* [[Nidze]]          (2,521 m)
* [[Deshat]]         (2,373 m)
* [[Galichica]]      (2,288 m)
* [[Stogovo]]        (2,273 m)
* [[Jablanica]]      (2,257 m)
* [[Mount Bistra]]   (2,163 m)

== Economy ==
:''Main article: [[Economy of the Republic of Macedonia]]''

Today the Republic of Macedonia is considered a country with an intermediary-developed industry, with continuing growth of the industrial production.  The process of transition in the country economy was triggered in 1995.  The Republic of Macedonia has arrangements with the IMF ([[International Monetary Fund]]) and [[World Bank]]. The Republic of Macedonia has an open economy, highly integrated into international trade, with a total trade-to-GDP ratio of 79.5%.  The most important sectors are agriculture and industry.  The service sector also grew in the past few years.  Work force education and skills are competitive, but without adequate jobs. 
The country economic policy is to attract foreign investments and to increase employment rate.  One of the biggest features of the country economy is the fiscal discipline which maintained stable course of the currency for a long period.  The country also makes effort to develop Small and Medium-Size Enterprise sector.

Looking back, the country together with Montenegro, Bosnia and Hercegovina and Kosovo belonged to the less developed regions in the former Yugoslavia.  It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav internal market collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended. In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist East European countries during the transition to a market economy.

The outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars]] and the imposition of sanctions on [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] caused great damage to the Republic's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets prior to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Matters worsened when Greece imposed a trade embargo on the Republic between 1994-1995. Some relief was afforded by the end of the Bosnian war in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilization.

The Macedonian economy has since made a sluggish recovery, though the extent of [[unemployment]], the [[grey market]], corruption and a relatively feeble legal system continue to cause significant problems and a low growth rate. The Republic still has one of the lowest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per capita GDPs]] in Europe. 

Since the end of the Greek embargo, [[Greece]] has become the most important business partner of the Republic of Macedonia. Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in the country, such as the oil refinery Okta, the baking company Zhito Luks, marble mine in [[Prilep]], textile facilities in [[Bitola]] etc.

Growth barely recovered in 2002 to 0.9%, then rose by 3.4% in 2003, 2.9% in 2004, and about 4% in 2005.  The past few years saw a significant rise in the economy and with the recent candidacy for the EU, the country should be making rapid progress.

== Demographics ==
:''Main article: [[Demographics of the Republic of Macedonia]]''

=== Population ===
The Republic of Macedonia has a population of approximately 2 070 000 citizens, according to the last population census in 2002.  In the urban areas are inhabited 58% of the population.

The Republic's biggest city by far is Skopje, the capital, with an estimated 600,000 inhabitants, followed by:
* Bitola (85 000)
* Kumanovo (70 000)
* Prilep (70 000)
* Tetovo (60 000)
* Veles (47 000)
* Ohrid (43 000)

* See also: [[List of cities in the Republic of Macedonia]]

=== Ethnicities ===
 
The Republic of Macedonia is an ethnically diverse country.  The largest ethnic group in the country are the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]].  In the last population census, approximately 1 300 000 inhabitants declared themselves to be Macedonians, which represents 64% of the total population.  Approximately 500 000 inhabitants are declared as [[Albanians]], representing 25% of the population. They are concentrated mostly in the western and north-western part of the country.  Smaller minorities include [[Turkish people|Turks]] (78,000 or 3.9%), [[Roma (people)|Roma]] (54,000 or 2.7%) and [[Serbs]] (36,000 or 1.8%). In smaller numbers, many more minorities exist, namely [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Slovenes]] and fewer still [[Montenegrins]] (all constituting a small presence of people from the former Yugoslavia); other minorities include [[Aromanians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Greeks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Torbesh]], [[Gorani]] and [[Pomaks]] (the last three are Slavic muslims who identify by one of the names), and [[Adyghe|Caucasians]] who live in a handful of villages. These account for less than 2.5% of the population of the country. The Macedonian national census records all these ethnic groups, but the smaller ones are not enumerated separately in the final report of the census.

* See also: [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia]]

=== Languages ===
A wide variety of languages are spoken in the Republic of Macedonia, reflecting its ethnic diversity. The official and most widely spoken language is [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], which belongs to the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] language group.Structurally, it is closer to Bulgarian than to other Slavonic langages, though it contains many words of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin. Its current form was codified after [[WWII]] and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. 

Other languages – including [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Romany language|Romany]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] – are spoken roughly in proportion with their associated ethnic groups. 

Although Macedonian is the country's official national language, in municipalities where at least 20% of the population is from other ethnic minorities their individual languages are used for official purposes in local government. The languages of the minorities, for example the Albanian language, can also be used in the national parliament and other national level institutions.

=== Religion ===
The majority of the population belongs to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] (66%). [[Muslim]]s comprise 29% of the population and other Christian denominations comprise 0.2%. The remainder is recorded as "unspecified" in the 2002 national census. Most of the native Albanians, Turks and Bosniaks are Muslims, as are a minority of the country's ethnic Slavic Macedonian population, known as [[Macedonian Muslims]].
Altogether, there are more than 1200 churches and 400 mosques in the country.  The Orthodox and Islamic religious communities have secondary religion schools in Skopje.  There is an Orthodox Theological college in the capital.

== Culture ==
:''Main article: [[Macedonian Culture (Slavic)|Macedonian Culture]]''

The Republic of Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in [[art]], [[architecture]], [[poetry]], and [[music]]. It has many ancient, protected religious sites. Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually.

Macedonian music styles developed under the strong influence of Byzantine church music.
Macedonia is among the countries with the most beautiful preserved Byzantine fresco painting, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. There are several thousands square metres of fresco painting preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian School of ecclesiastical painting.

In Macedonia the past meets the present. Its age-old architecture and monasteries and churches of exquisite beauty make an interesting contrast to the super modern new architecture.
Most of the Macedonian monasteries, built in various periods, and particularly those built between the 11th and 15th -16th centuries, have been completely preserved until today.
The Macedonian collection of icons, and in particular the Ohrid one, is among the most valuable collections in the world today. After the Sinai and the Moscow collection of icons, it is third in importance in Orthodoxy. From a Byzantological aspect, it is unique.

The most important cultural events in the country are the [[Ohrid]] Summer festival of classical music and drama, the [[Struga]] Poetry evenings which gather poets from more than 50 countries in the world, Skopje May Opera Evenings, International Camera Festival in [[Bitola]], Open Youth Theatre and Jazz festivals in Skopje etc.
