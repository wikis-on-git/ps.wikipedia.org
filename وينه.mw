Anatomically, blood is considered a [[connective tissue]] from both its origin in the bones and its function.


== د وينې کړنې==
 
* Supply of [[oxygen]] to tissues (bound to [[hemoglobin]] which is carried in red cells)
* Supply of nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[amino acids]] and [[fatty acids]] (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins)
* Removal of waste such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[urea]] and [[lactic acid]]
* Immunological functions, including circulation of white cells, and detection of foreign material by [[antibodies]]
* [[Coagulation]], which is one part of the body's self-repair mechanism
* Messenger functions, including the transport of [[hormones]] and the signalling of tissue damage
* Regulation of body [[pH]]
* Regulation of core [[body temperature]]
* [[Hydraulics|Hydraulic]] functions, including [[erection]] (see also [[jumping spider]])

Problems with blood composition or circulation can lead to downstream tissue dysfunction. The term ''ischaemia'' refers to tissue which is inadequately perfused with blood.

The blood is circulated around the [[lungs]] and body by the [[pump]]ing action of the [[heart]].  Additional return pressure may be generated by gravity and the actions of skeletal muscles. In mammals, blood is in equilibrium with [[lymph]], which is continuously formed from blood (by capillary ultrafiltration) and returned to the blood (via the [[thoracic duct]]). The lymphatic circulation has been called the "second circulation".

==Anatomy of mammalian blood==
Blood is composed of several kinds of cells (occasionally called ''corpuscles''); these ''formed elements'' of the blood constitute about 45% of whole blood by volume, mostly red blood cells. The other 55% is [[blood plasma]], a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium, appearing yellow in color. The proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the [[hematocrit]].[[Image:SEM blood cells.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) image of normal circulating human blood. One can see [[red blood cell]]s, several [[white blood cell]]s including knobby [[lymphocyte]]s, a [[monocyte]], a [[neutrophil]], and many small disc-shaped [[platelet]]s.]]
The normal [[pH]] of human arterial blood is approximately 7.40 (normal range is 7.35-7.45), a weak alkaline solution. Blood that has a pH below 7.35 is [[acidic]], while blood pH above 7.45 is [[alkaline]]. Blood pH along with arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and [[Bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]] readings are helpful in determining the acid-base balance of the body. The [[respiratory system]] and [[urinary system]] normally control the acid-base balance of blood as part of [[homeostasis]]. Blood is about 7% of the human body weight,<ref>[http://www.bloodcenters.org/aboutblood/bloodfacts.htm Bloodcenters.org]</ref> so the average adult has a blood volume of about 5 [[litre]]s, of which 2.7-3 litres is plasma. Human blood density is around 1060 kg/m³.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/MichaelShmukler.shtml | title = Density of Blood | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | year = 2004 | publisher = [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/ The Physics Factbook] }}</ref> The combined surface area of all the red cells in the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface.{{fact}}

The cells are:
*''[[Red blood cell]]s or erythrocytes'' (96%). In mammals, mature red blood cells lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[organelle]]s. They contain the blood's [[haemoglobin]] and distribute oxygen. The red blood cells (together with [[endothelial]] vessel cells and some other cells) are also marked by [[glycoprotein]]s that define the different [[Human blood group systems|blood types]].
*''[[White blood cell]]s or leukocytes'' (3.0%), are part of the [[immune system]]; they destroy infectious agents, [[pathogens]].
*''[[Platelet]]s or thrombocytes'' (1.0%) are responsible for blood clotting ([[coagulation]]). They change fibrinogen into fibrin. This fibrin creates a mesh onto which red blood cells collect and clot. This clot stops more blood from leaving the body and also helps to prevent bacteria from entering the body

[[Blood plasma]] is essentially an [[water|aqueous]] solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma [[protein]]s, and trace amounts of other materials. Some components are:
* [[Serum albumin]]
* Blood clotting factors (to facilitate [[coagulation]])
* [[Immunoglobulins]] (antibodies)
* [[Hormone]]s
* Carbon dioxide
* Various other [[protein]]s
* Various [[electrolyte]]s (mainly [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]])

Together, plasma and cells form a [[non-Newtonian fluid]] whose flow properties are uniquely adapted to the architecture of the blood vessels.

The term ''serum'' refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the protein remaining is albumin and [[antibody|immunoglobulins]].

Blood cells are produced in the [[bone marrow]], this process is termed [[hematopoiesis]]. The proteinaceous component (including clotting proteins) is produced overwhelmingly in the [[liver]], while hormones are produced by the [[endocrine gland]]s and the watery fraction regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] and maintained by the [[kidney]] and indirectly by the [[gut]].

Blood cells are degraded by the [[spleen]] and the [[Kupffer cell]]s in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids and [[amino acid]]s. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the [[urine]]. Erythrocytes usually live up to 120 days before they are systematically replaced by new erythrocytes created by the process of hematopoiesis.

See [[Oxygen transportation]].

Blood oxygenation is measured in several ways, but the most important measure is the hemoglobin (Hb) saturation percentage. This is a non-linear (sigmoidal) function of the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen. About 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at normal pressure is chemically combined with the Hb. Only 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to Hb. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species (for exceptions, see below).

With the exception of [[Pulmonary artery|pulmonary]] and [[Umbilical artery|umbilical arteries]] and their corresponding veins, [[artery|arteries]] carry oxygenated blood away from the [[heart]] and deliver it to the body via [[arteriole]]s and [[capillary|capillaries]], where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, [[venule]]s and [[vein]]s carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. 

Differences in infrared absorption between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood form the basis for realtime oxygen saturation measurement in hospitals and ambulances.

Under normal conditions in humans at rest, haemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98-99% saturated with oxygen.  In a healthy adult at rest, ''deoxygenated'' blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75% saturated.<ref>[http://home.hia.no/~stephens/ventphys.htm Ventilation and Endurance Performance]</ref><ref>[http://groups.msn.com/TransplantSupportLungHeartLungHeart/oxygen2.msnw Transplant Support- Lung, Heart/Lung, Heart] MSN groups</ref>  Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1464731 J Physiol. 2005 July 1]</ref>  Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia): "As a general rule, any condition which leads to a sustained mixed venous saturation of less than 50% will be poorly tolerated and a mixed venous saturation of less than 30% should be viewed as a medical emergency."<ref>[http://www.manbit.com/PAC/chapters/P30.cfm The 'St George' Guide To Pulmonary Artery Catheterisation]</ref>

A fetus, receiving oxygen via the placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 20% of the level found in an adult's lungs) and so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) in order to extract as much oxygen as possible from this sparse supply.<ref>[http://members.aol.com/Bio50/LecNotes/lecnot20.html Oxygen Carriage in Blood - High Altitude]</ref>

Substances other than oxygen can bind to the hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. [[Carbon monoxide]] for example is extremely dangerous when absorbed into the blood. When combined with the hemoglobin, it irreversibly makes [[carboxyhemoglobin]] which reduces the volume of oxygen that can be carried in the blood. This can very quickly cause suffocation, as oxygen is vital to many organisms (including humans). This damage can occur when smoking a [[cigarette]] (or similar item) or in event of a fire. Thus carbon monoxide is considered far more dangerous than the actual fire itself because it reduces the oxygen carrying content of the blood.

====مياشې====
In [[insect]]s, the blood (more properly called [[hemolymph]]) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called [[trachea]]e allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues). Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.

====کوچني بې شمزۍ ژوي====
In some small [[invertebrate]]s like [[insects]], oxygen is simply dissolved in the plasma. Larger animals use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. [[Hemocyanin]] ([[blue]]) contains [[copper]] and is found in [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusk]]s. It is thought that [[tunicate]]s (sea squirts) might use [[vanabins]] ([[protein]]s containing [[vanadium]]) for respiratory pigment (bright [[green]], blue, or [[orange (colour)|orange]]).

In many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized [[red blood cell]]s, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing [[viscosity]] or damaging blood filtering organs like the [[kidneys]].

====د ژور سيندونو بې شمزۍ ژوي====
[[Giant tube worms]] have extraordinary hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments.  These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.

===د کاربون ډاي آکسايډ لېږدېدنه===
When systemic arterial blood flows through capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the tissues into the blood. Some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood. Some carbon dioxide reacts with hemoglobin and other proteins to form [[carbamino]] compounds. The remaining carbon dioxide is converted to [[bicarbonate]] and [[hydrogen ion]]s through the action of RBC [[carbonic anhydrase]]. Most carbon dioxide is transported through the blood in the form of bicarbonate ions.

===د هايډروجن آيونونو لېږدېدنه===
Some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin has a much greater affinity for H+ than does oxyhemoglobin so it binds most of the hydrogen ions.

===رنګ===
In humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures, oxygenated blood is bright red. This is due to oxygenated iron in the red blood cells. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red, which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. However, due to an optical effect caused by the way in which light penetrates through the skin, veins typically appear blue in color. This has led to a common misconception that venous blood is blue before it is exposed to air. Another reason for this misconception is that medical charts always show venous blood as blue in order to distinguish it from arterial blood which is depicted as red on the same chart.

The blood of [[horseshoe crab]]s is blue, which is a result of its high content in copper-based hemocyanin instead of the iron-based hemoglobin found, for example, in humans.

===Provision of force===
In mammals the restriction of blood flow is commonly used as a temporary provision of force, as in an [[erection]].

==روغتيا او ناروغۍ==
===لرغوني درمل===
[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] medicine considered blood one of the [[four humors]] (together with [[phlegm]], [[yellow bile]] and [[black bile]]). As many diseases were thought to be due to an excess of blood, [[bloodletting]] and [[leeching]] were a common intervention until the [[19th century]] (it is still used for some rare blood disorders).

In classical Greek medicine, blood was associated with air, springtime, and with a merry and gluttonous (''sanguine'') personality. It was also believed to be produced exclusively by the [[liver]].

[[Blood pressure]] and [[blood test]]s are amongst the most commonly performed diagnostic investigations that directly concern the blood.

{{seealso|Blood diseases}}

Problems with blood circulation and composition play a role in many diseases.
* [[Injury|Wounds]] can cause major blood loss (see [[bleeding]]). The [[thrombocyte]]s cause the blood to [[coagulation|coagulate]], blocking relatively minor wounds, but larger ones must be repaired at speed to prevent [[exsanguination]]. Damage to the internal organs can cause severe [[internal bleeding]], or [[hemorrhage]].
* Circulation blockage can also create many medical conditions from [[ischemia]] in the short term to tissue [[necrosis]] and [[gangrene]] in the long term.
* [[Hemophilia]] is a genetic illness that causes dysfunction in one of the blood's [[coagulation|clotting mechanisms]]. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in [[hemarthrosis]], or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.
* [[Leukemia]] is a group of [[cancer (medicine)|cancers]] of the blood-forming tissues.
* Major blood loss, whether traumatic or not (e.g. during surgery), as well as certain blood diseases like [[anemia]] and [[thalassemia]], can require [[blood transfusion]]. Several countries have [[blood bank]]s to fill the demand for transfusable blood. A person receiving a blood transfusion must have a [[blood type]] compatible with that of the donor.
* Blood is an important vector of infection. [[HIV]], the [[virus]] which causes [[AIDS]], is transmitted through contact between blood, [[semen]], or the bodily secretions of an infected person. [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to [[blood-borne infection]]s, bloodstained objects are treated as a [[Biological hazard|biohazard]].
* Bacterial infection of the blood is [[bacteremia]] or [[sepsis]]. Viral Infection is viremia. [[Malaria]] and [[trypanosomiasis]] are blood-borne parasitic infections.

===درملنه===
[[Blood transfusion]] is the most direct therapeutic use of blood. It is obtained from human donors by [[blood donation]]. As there are different [[blood type]]s, and transfusion of the incorrect blood may cause severe complications, [[crossmatching]] is done to ascertain the correct type is transfused.

Other blood products administered [[intravenous]]ly are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate and specific coagulation factor concentrates.

Many forms of medication (from [[antibiotic]]s to [[chemotherapy]]) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.

As stated above, some diseases are still treated by removing blood from the circulation.

It is the fluid part of the blood that saves lives where severe blood loss occurs, other preparations can be given such as ringers atopical plasma volume expander as a non-blood alternative, and these alternatives where used are rivalling blood use where used.

==Mythology and religion==
Due to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships; to be "related by blood" is to be related by ancestry or descendance, rather than marriage. This bears closely to [[bloodline]]s, and sayings such as "blood is thicker than water" and "bad blood", as well as "[[Blood brother]]". Blood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions because ([[Leviticus]] 17:11) says "the life of a creature is in the blood."

The differences in sugars and protein sequences sets human blood apart from animal blood and this has been used as an argument for creation in religious circles.

===Indo-European paganism===
Among the [[Germanic tribe]]s (such as the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Viking]]s), blood was used during the sacrifices, the ''[[Blót]]s''. The blood was considered to have the power of its originator and after the butchering the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called ''bleodsian'' in [[Old English language|Old English]] and the terminology was borrowed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] becoming ''to bless'' and ''blessing''. The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] word for blood, ''ishar'' was a cognate to words for "oath" and "bond", see [[Ishara]].
The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] believed that the blood of the Gods, ''[[ichor]]'', was a mineral that was poisonous to mortals.

===د يهوديت له مخې===
In [[Judaism]], blood cannot be consumed even in the smallest quantity ([[Leviticus]] 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish [[diet (nutrition)|dietary]] laws ([[Kashrut]]). Blood is purged from [[meat]] by [[salting (food)|salting]] and soaking in water.

Other rituals involving blood are the covering of the blood of [[fowl]] and [[game]] after slaughtering ([[Leviticus]] 17:13); the reason given by the [[Torah]] is: "Because the life of every animal is [in] his blood" (ibid 17:14), although from its context in [[Leviticus]] 3:17 it would appear that blood cannot be consumed because it is to be used in the [[sacrifice|sacrificial service]] (known as the ''[[korbanot]]''), in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Blood (the blood of a lamb) was also the means for antonement of sins for the Jews.

Ironically, [[Judaism]] has historically been the religion to be most affected by [[blood libel]]s.

===د عيسويت له مخې===
{{main|Eucharist}}
Some Christian churches, including [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], branches of [[Anglicanism]], and the [[Moravians (religion)|Moravian Church]], teach that when consecrated the [[Eucharist]] [[wine]] ''becomes'' the material Blood of [[Jesus]]. Thus in the consecrated wine (now the Most Precious Blood of Christ), Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in [[the Last Supper]] as written in the four gospels of the [[Bible]], in which Jesus stated to his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]] that the bread which they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. ''"This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke |chapter=22|verse=20}})''. Various forms of Protestantism, especially those of a Wesleyan or Presbyterian lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is not physically but spiritually present. Blood (the blood of Jesus Christ) is also seen as the means for atonement for sins for Christians.  [[Lutheran]] theology teaches that the body and blood is present together "in, with, and under" the bread and wine of the eucharist feast.
[[Mormons]] believe that before [[Adam]] and [[Eve (Bible)|Eve]] ate the forbidden fruit, blood was not present in their bodies. It is said to have formed after the Fall when they became mortal.

===د اسلام له مخې===
Consumption of food containing blood is forbidden by [[Islamic dietary laws]].

===د يهوا د ګواهانو له مخې===
{{main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not eat blood or accept tranfusions of whole blood or its four major components namely, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and whole plasma.  Members are instructed to personally decide whether or not to accept fractions, and medical procedures that involve their own blood.

===Vampire legends===
[[Vampire]]s are mythological beings which live forever by drinking the blood of the living. Stories of creatures of this kind are known all over the world. European versions of this myth are mostly inspired by folklore based on the stories regarding [[Vlad Dracula]].{{fact}}

===د چينايي او جاپاني فرهڼونو له مخې===
In Chinese culture, it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood, this signifies that he is experiencing sexual desire. This often appears in [[China|Chinese-language]] and [[Hong Kong]] [[film]]s.
This is also evident in [[Japan]]ese culture and is parodied in [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Male characters will often be shown with a [[nosebleed]] if they have just seen a female [[nude]] or in little clothing, or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy.{{fact}}

Blood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art.<ref>[http://artscad.com/A.nsf/Opra/SRVV-6MDNX5 "Nostalgia"] Artwork in blood</ref> In particular, the performances of [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionist]] [[Hermann Nitsch]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]], [[Ron Athey]], [[Yang Zhichao]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]] along with the photography of [[Andres Serrano]], have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element.
