{{psychology}}
'''Psychology''' (from Greek: ψυχή, ''psukhē'', "spirit, soul"; and λόγος, ''logos'', "knowledge") is an [[academic]]/ [[applied science|applied]] discipline involving the [[science|scientific study]] of [[Mental function|mental processes]] and [[behavior]]. Psychologists study such phenomena as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[personality psychology|personality]], [[behavior]], and [[interpersonal relationships]]. Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.  

Psychology is separate from [[social sciences]] (e.g., [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, as opposed to [[group (sociology)|groups]] or [[institutions]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain, a [[philosophy of mind]] known as [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behavior, and [[mental disorders]].

==تاريخ==
{{main|History of psychology}}

===پخواني پرمختګونه===
[[Image:Rudolf-Goclenius-1.jpg|thumb|126px|left|Rudolf Goclenius]]
The first use of the term "psychology" is  attributed to the [[German people|German]] [[scholastic]] [[philosopher]] Rudolf Goeckel (Latinized [[Rudolph Goclenius]]), published in [[1590]].<ref>"Yucologia hoc est de hominis perfectione, anima, ortu", published in [[Marburg]] in [[1590]], was written by the [[German people|German]] [[scholastic]] [[philosopher]] Rudolf Goeckel (1547-1628), who often goes by the Latinized [[Rudolph Goclenius]].</ref> More than six decades earlier, however, the Croatian humanist [[Marko Marulić]] used the term in the title of a work which was subsequently lost.<ref>[[Marko Marulić]] (1450-1524) used the term "psychology" in the title of his Latin treatise "Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae." Although the treatise itself has not been preserved, its title appears in a list of Marulic's works compiled by his younger contemporary, [[Franjo Bozicevic-Natalis]] in his "Vita Marci Maruli Spalatensis" (Krstić, 1964).</ref> This, of course, may not have been the very first usage, but it is the earliest documented use at present.

The term did not fall into popular usage until the German idealist philosopher, [[Christian Wolff]] (1679-1754) used it in his ''Psychologia empirica and Psychologia rationalis''  (1732-1734). This distinction between empirical and rational psychology was picked up in [[Diderot]]'s ''Encyclopedie'' and was popularized in France by [[Maine de Biran]].

The root of the word psychology ([[psyche]]) is very roughly equivalent to "[[soul]]" in Greek, and ([[ology]]) equivalent to "[[research|study]]". Psychology came to be considered a study of the soul (in a religious sense of this term) much later, in Christian times. Psychology as a medical discipline can be seen in [[Thomas Willis]]' reference to psychology (the "Doctrine of the Soul") in terms of [[human brain|brain function]], as part of his [[1672]] [[anatomical]] treatise "De Anima Brutorum" ("Two Discourses on the Souls of Brutes"). Until about the end of the [[19th century]], psychology was regarded as a branch of [[philosophy]].

===پخوانی پېر===
In [[1879]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920), known as "the father of psychology", founded a laboratory for the study of psychology at [[Leipzig University]] in [[Germany]]. The American philosopher [[William James]] published his seminal book, ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'', in 1890, laying the foundations for many of the questions that [[psychologist]]s would focus on for years to come. Other important {{Fact|date=April 2007}} early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850–1909), a pioneer in the experimental study of [[memory]] at the [[University of Berlin]]; and the [[Russia]]n [[physiology|physiologist]] [[Ivan Pavlov]] (1849-1936), who investigated the [[learning]] process now referred to as [[classical conditioning]]. 

[[Image:Rodin The Thinker Laeken cemetery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s ''The Thinker'', bronze cast by Alexis Rudier, [[Laeken]] Cemetery, [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].]]
Meanwhile, during the [[1890s]], the [[Austria]]n physician [[Sigmund Freud]], who was trained as a [[neurology|neurologist]] and had no formal training in experimental psychology, had developed a method of [[psychotherapy]] known as [[psychoanalysis]]. Freud's understanding of the mind was largely based on interpretive methods and [[introspection]], and was focused in particular on resolving mental distress and [[psychopathology]]. Freud's theories became very well-known, largely because they tackled subjects such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[psychological repression|repression]] as general aspects of psychological development{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. These were largely considered [[taboo]] subjects at the time{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Although Freud's theories are only of limited interest in modern academic psychology departments{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, his application of psychology to clinical work has been very influential{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

Partly in reaction to the subjective and introspective nature of Freudian psychology, and its focus on the recollection of childhood experiences{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, during the early decades of the [[20th century]], [[behaviorism]] gained popularity as a guiding psychological theory. Founded by [[John B. Watson]] and embraced and extended by [[Edward Thorndike]], Hull, Clark, Tolman, and later [[B.F. Skinner]]), behaviorism was grounded in studies of animal behavior{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Behaviorists argued that psychology should be a science of ''behavior'', '''not''' the mind, and rejected the idea that internal mental states such as [[belief]]s, [[desire]]s, or goals could be studied scientifically{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. In his paper "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It" (1913)<ref>Watson, John B. "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It" http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Watson/views.htm</ref>, Watson argued that psychology "is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science," that "introspection forms no essential part of its methods", and that "the behaviorist recognizes no dividing line between man and brute."

Behaviorism reigned as the dominant model in psychology throughout the first half of the 20th century{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, largely due to the creation of [[conditioning]] theories as scientific models of human behavior, and their successful application in the workplace and in fields such as [[advertising]] and [[military science]]{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

===نوی پېر===
However, it became increasingly clear that although behaviorism had made some important discoveries, it was deficient as a guiding theory of human behavior.<ref name = "Miller">Miller, G.A. (2003). The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences.'' 7:141-144. [http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~geo/Miller.pdf (online)]</ref> [[Noam Chomsky]]'s review of Skinner's book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' (which aimed to explain [[language acquisition]] in a behaviorist framework) is considered one of the major factors in the ending of behaviorism's reign.<ref name = "Miller" /> In his theory of [[Generative Grammar]] Chomsky demonstrated that language could not be learned purely from conditioning, because people could produce sentences unique in structure and meaning that couldn't possibly be generated solely through experience of natural language — implying that there must be internal states of mind that behaviorism rejected as illusory.<ref>http://www.rso.cornell.edu/scitech/archive/96fal/lang.html</ref> Similarly, work by [[Albert Bandura]] showed that children could [[social learning theory|learn by social observation]], without any change in overt behavior, and so must be accounted for by internal representations{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

[[Humanistic psychology]] emerged in the 1950s and has continued as a reaction to [[positivism|positivist]] and scientific approaches to the mind. It stresses a [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] view of human experience and seeks to understand human beings and their behavior by conducting [[qualitative psychological research|qualitative research]]. The humanistic approach has its roots in [[existentialism|existentialist]] and [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] philosophy and many humanist psychologists completely reject a scientific approach, arguing that trying to turn human experience into measurements strips it of all meaning and relevance to lived existence{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

Some of the founding theorists behind this school of thought were [[Abraham Maslow]] who formulated a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human needs]], [[Carl Rogers]] who created and developed [[Client-centered therapy]], and [[Fritz Perls]] who helped create and develop [[Gestalt therapy]]. 

The rise of computer technology also promoted the metaphor of mental function as [[information processing]]. This, combined with a scientific approach to studying the mind, as well as a belief in internal mental states, led to the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] as the dominant model of the mind{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

Links between [[brain]] and [[nervous system]] function were also becoming common, partly due to the experimental work of people such as [[Charles Sherrington]] and [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]], and partly due to studies of people with [[brain injury]] (see [[cognitive neuropsychology]]). With the development of technologies for accurately measuring brain function, [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] have become some of the most active areas in contemporary psychology{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. With the increasing involvement of other disciplines (such as [[philosophy]], [[computer science]] and [[neuroscience]]) in the quest to understand the mind, the umbrella discipline of [[cognitive science]] has been created as a means of focusing such efforts in a constructive way{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

==اصول==
===ماغزه او اند===
Psychology describes and attempts to explain consciousness, behavior and social interaction. Empirical psychology is primarily devoted to describing human experience and behavior as it actually occurs. In the past 20 years or so psychology has begun to examine the relationship between consciousness and the [[brain]] or [[nervous system]]. It is still not clear in what ways these interact: does consciousness determine brain states or do brain states determine consciousness - or are both going on in various ways? Perhaps to understand this you need to know the definition of "[[consciousness]]" and "brain state" - or is [[consciousness]] some sort of complicated 'illusion' which bears no direct relationship to neural processes? An understanding of brain function is increasingly being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].

{{main|List of psychological schools}}
Various schools of thought have argued for a particular model to be used as a guiding theory by which all, or the majority, of human behavior can be explained. The popularity of these has waxed and waned over time. Some [[psychologist]]s may think of themselves as adherents to a particular school of thought and reject the others, although most consider each as an approach to understanding the mind, and not necessarily as mutually exclusive theories.

==Scope==
Psychology is an extremely broad field, encompassing many different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior. Below are the major areas of inquiry that comprise psychology, divided into fields of research psychology and fields of applied psychology. A comprehensive list of the sub-fields and areas within psychology can be found at the [[list of psychological topics]] and [[list of psychology disciplines]].

====د څېړنيزې ساپوهنې ډګرونه====
{{main|Qualitative psychological research|Quantitative psychological research}}
Research psychology encompasses the study of behavior for use in [[academic]] settings, and contains numerous areas. It contains the areas of [[abnormal psychology]], [[biological psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[comparative psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] and others. Research psychology is contrasted with [[applied psychology]].

=====غېرنورماله ساپوهنه=====
{{main|Abnormal psychology}}
[[Abnormal psychology]] is the study of [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormal behavior]] in order to describe, predict, explain, and change abnormal patterns of functioning. Abnormal psychology studies the nature of [[psychopathology]] and its causes, and this knowledge is applied in [[clinical psychology]] to treating patients with psychological disorders.

In the study of abnomal behavior, it can be difficult to define the line between which behaviors are considered normal and which are not. In general, abnormal behaviors must be maladaptive and cause an individual subjective discomfort (signs of emotional distress).  Generally, abnormal behaviors are classified as:

*Abnormal as in "infrequent" in relation to the overall population.

*Abnormal as in "maladaptive".  The behavior fails to promote well being, growth, and fulfillment of a person.

*Abnormal as in "deviant".  The behavior is not socially acceptable.

*Abnormal as in "unjustifiable". The behavior that cannot be rationalized.

{{main|Biological psychology|Neuropsychology|Physiological psychology|Cognitive Neuroscience|Evolutionary psychology}}

[[Biological psychology]] is the scientific study of the biological bases of behavior and mental states. Because all behavior is controlled by the [[central nervous system]], it is sensible to study how the [[brain]] functions in order to understand behavior. This is the approach taken in [[behavioral neuroscience]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[neuropsychology]]. Neuropsychology is the branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the [[brain]] relate to specific behavioral and psychological processes. Often neuropsychologists are employed as scientists to advance scientific or medical knowledge. Neuropsychology is particularly concerned with the understanding of [[brain injury]] in an attempt to work out normal psychological function.

The approach of [[cognitive neuroscience]] to studying the link between brain and behavior is to use [[neuroimaging]] tools, such as [[fMRI]], to observe which areas of the brain are active during a particular task.

<br style="clear:all;">

[[Image:MultiLayerNeuralNetwork english.png|thumb|150px|Neural network with two layers]]
{{main|Cognitive psychology}}

The nature of [[thought]] is another core interest in psychology. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes]] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. [[Perception]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], [[memory]], [[attention]], [[language]] and [[emotion]] are all well researched areas. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. 

[[Cognitive science]] is very closely related to cognitive psychology, but differs in some of the research methods used, and has a slightly greater emphasis on explaining mental phenomena in terms of both behavior and neural processing.

Both areas can use [[computer simulation|computational models]] to simulate phenomena of interest. Because mental events cannot directly be observed, computational models provide a tool for studying the functional organization of the mind. Such models give cognitive psychologists a way to study the "software" of mental processes independent of the "hardware" it runs on, be it the brain or a computer.

{{main|Comparative psychology}}

[[Comparative psychology]] refers to the study of the behavior and mental life of [[animal]]s other than human beings. It is related to disciplines outside of psychology that study animal behavior, such as [[ethology]]. Although the field of psychology is primarily concerned with humans, the behavior and mental processes of [[animal]]s is also an important part of psychological research, either as a subject in its own right (e.g., [[animal cognition]] and ethology), or with strong emphasis about evolutionary links, and somewhat more controversially, as a way of gaining an insight into human psychology by means of comparison or via animal models of emotional and behavior systems as seen in neuroscience of psychology (e.g., [[affective neuroscience]] and [[social neuroscience]]).

[[Image:Baby thinking Sofia SERRES.jpg|thumb|150px|left|How do infants experience the world?]]
{{main|Developmental psychology}}

Mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of small infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study [[aging]] and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]'s theory of development in context (''The Ecology of Human Development'' - ISBN 0-674-22456-6) is influential in this field, as are those mentioned in "Educational psychology" immediately below, as well as many others. Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of theorists in scientific psychology to inform their research.

=====د شخصيت ساپوهنه=====
{{main|Personality psychology}}

[[Personality psychology]] studies enduring psychological patterns of [[behavior]], [[thought]] and [[emotion]], commonly called an individual's [[wikt:personality|personality]]. Theories of personality vary between different psychological schools. [[Trait theory|Trait theories]] attempts to break personality down into a number of traits, by use of [[factor analysis]]. The number of traits have varied between theories. One of the first, and smallest, models was that of [[Hans Eysenck]], which had three dimensions: [[extraversion]]&mdash;[[introversion]], [[neuroticism]]&mdash;[[emotion|emotional stability]], and [[psychoticism]]. [[Raymond Cattell]] proposed a theory of [[16 Personality Factors|16 personality factors]]. The theory that has most empirical evidence behind it today may be the "[[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]]" theory, proposed by [[Lewis Goldberg]], and others. 

A different, but well known, approach to personality is that of [[Sigmund Freud]], whose ''structural theory of personality'' divided personality into the [[ego, superego, and id]]. Freud's theory of personality has been criticized by many, including many mainstream psychologists.

=====Quantitative psychology=====
{{Main|Quantitative psychology}}

[[Quantitative psychology]] involves the application of [[statistics|statistical]] analysis to psychological research, and the development of novel statistical approaches for measuring and explaining human behavior. It is a young field (only recently have Ph.D. programs in quantitative psychology been formed), and it is loosely comprised of the subfields [[psychometrics]] and [[mathematical psychology]].

Psychometrics is the field of psychology concerned with the theory and technique of psychological [[measurement]], which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits. Measurement of these unobservable [[phenomenon|phenomena]] is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated knowledge in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena. Psychometric research typically involves two major research tasks, namely: (i) the construction of [[Laboratory equipment|instruments]] and procedures for measurement; and (ii) the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement.

{{main|Social psychology (psychology)}}

[[social psychology (psychology)|Social psychology]] is the study of the nature and causes of human social behavior, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. Social Psychology aims to understand how we make sense of social situations. For example, this could involve the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g., [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]] or [[persuasion]]), the perception and understanding of social cues, or the formation of [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] or [[stereotype]]s about other people. [[Social cognition]] is a common approach and involves a mostly cognitive and scientific approach to understanding social behavior.

====Fields of applied psychology====
{{main|Applied psychology}}
[[Applied psychology]] encompasses both psychological research that is designed to help individuals overcome practical problems and the application of this research in applied settings.  Much of applied psychology research is utilized in other fields, such as [[business management]], [[product design]], [[ergonomics]], [[nutrition]], [[law]] and [[clinical medicine]]. [[Applied psychology]] includes the areas of [[clinical psychology]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]], [[human factors]], [[forensic psychology]], [[health psychology]], [[school psychology]], [[community psychology]] and others.

=====کلينيکي ساپوهنه=====
{{main|Clinical psychology}}
[[Clinical psychology]] is the application of psychological science and research to the understanding, treatment, and assessment of health problems, particularly emotional, behavioral and mental health problems. It has traditionally been associated with [[psychological treatment]] and [[psychotherapy]], although modern clinical psychology may take an eclectic approach, including a number of therapeutic approaches. Typically, although working with many of the same clients as [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], clinical psychologists do not prescribe psychiatric drugs. Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with [[brain injury]]. This area is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]].

In recent years and particularly in the [[United States]], a major split has been developing between academic research psychologists in universities and some branches of clinical psychology. Many research psychologists believe that many contemporary clinicians use therapies based on discredited theories and unsupported by empirical evidence of their effectiveness. From the other side, these clinicians believe that the research psychologists are ignoring their experience in dealing with actual patients. The disagreement resulted in the formation of the [[Association for Psychological Science]] by the research psychologists as a new body distinct from the [[American Psychological Association]].

The  work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be done inside various therapy models.  A popular model is the Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) framework. CBT is an umbrella term that refers to a number of therapies which focus on changing cognitions and/or behaviors, rather than changing behavior exclusively, or discovering the unconscious causes of psychopathology (as in the psychodynamic school). The two most famous CBT therapies are Aaron T. Beck's [[cognitive therapy]] and Albert Ellis's [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (with cognitive therapy being, by far, the most extensively studied therapy in contemporary clinical psychology).

A related area is [[community psychology]], which examines psychological and mental health issues on the level of the community rather than using the individual as the unit of measurement. "[[Sense of community]]" has become its conceptual center (Sarason, 1986; Chavis & Pretty, 1999).

=====Counseling psychology=====
{{main|Counseling psychology}}
[[Counseling psychology]] is a psychology specialty that facilitates personal and [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] functioning across the lifespan with a focus on emotional, social, [[vocational education|vocational]], educational, health-related, developmental, and organizational concerns. Counseling psychology differs from clinical psychology in that it is focused more on normal developmental issues and everyday [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] rather than psychopathology. Counseling psychologists are employed in a variety of settings, including universities, hospitals, schools, governmental organizations, businesses, private practice, and community mental health centers.

The emerging field of [[relationship counseling]], which characterizes ordinary human relationship successes and failures in concrete terms, has the specific appeal of avoiding psychology's practice of ascribing [[psychopathology|pathology]] to individuals who seek assistance. Current health insurance reimbursement for psychological services commonly involves the assignment of mental disease [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nomenclature nomenclature](a feature that potential clients may find offensive, and that could potentially be [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]]).

Relationship counseling, also referred to as "relationship education", includes psychologists, psychiatrists, and [[social work]]ers. It is based on decades of university-based research, drawing on knowledge gained through close [[observation]] and analysis of both successful and unsuccessful marriages and family units. <!-- Important names in this field are [[John Gottman]], [[Diane Sollee]], [[Howard Markman]], [[Scott Stanley]], [[Bill Doherty]] and [[Michele Weiner-Davis]]. -->

=====Educational psychology=====
{{main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in [[education]]al settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] of [[school]]s as organizations. The work of child psychologists such as [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating [[teaching]] methods and educational practices.

=====Psychology and Law=====
{{main|Legal psychology | Forensic psychology}}

Together, [[Forensic psychology]] and [[Legal psychology|Legal Psychology]] compose the area known as Psychology and Law. 

Most typically, forensic psychology is practiced by [[clinical psychologist]]s, and involves a clinical analysis of a particular individual and an assessment of some specific psycho-legal question. Typically, referrals to forensic practices constitute assessments for individuals that have allegedly suffered neurological insult(s). These patients have sought legal recourse, and the job of the forensic psychologist is to demonstrate that there is or is not (depending on their employment by either the prosecution or defense) a cause-and-effect relation between the accident and the subsequent (again, alleged) neurological change.

Legal psychology is a research-oriented field populated with researchers from several different areas within psychology (although [[Social psychology (psychology)|Social]] Psychologists are typical).

=====Health psychology=====
{{main|Health psychology}}
[[Health psychology]] is the application of psychological theory and research to health, illness and health care. Whereas clinical psychology focuses on mental health and neurological illness, [[health psychology]] is concerned with the psychology of a much wider range of health-related behavior including healthy eating, the doctor-patient relationship, a patient's understanding of health information, and beliefs about illness. Health psychologists may be involved in public health campaigns, examining the impact of illness or health policy on [[quality of life]]atin research into the psychological impact of health and social care.

=====Human factors psychology=====
{{main|Human factors}}
[[Human factors|Human factors psychology]] is the study of how cognitive and psychological processes affect our interaction with tools and objects in the environment. The goal of research in human factors psychology is to better design objects by taking into account the limitations and biases of human mental processes and behavior.

=====Industrial and organizational psychology=====
{{main|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
[[Industrial and organizational psychology]] (I/O) is among the newest fields in psychology.  [[Industrial Psychology]] focuses on improving, evaluating, and predicting job performance while [[Organizational Psychology]] focuses on how organizations impact and interact with individuals.  In 1910, through the works and experiments of [[Hugo Munsterberg]] and [[Walter Dill Scott]], [[Industrial Psychology]]  became recognized as a legitimate part of the social science.<ref name="IOPsych">Industrial and Organization Psychology, Fourth Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2006.</ref>  Organizational Psychology was not officially added until the 1970s and since then, the field has flourished.  The [http://www.siop.org/ Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology] has approximately 3400 professional members and 1900 student members.  These two numbers combine to make up only about four percent of the members in the [[American Psychology Association]] but the number has been rising since 1939 when there were only one hundred professional I/O psychologists.<ref name="IOPsych"/>

I/O psychologists are employed by academic institutions, consulting firms, internal human resources in industries, and governmental institutions.  Various universities across the United States are beginning to strengthen their I/O Psychology programs due to the increase of interest and job demand in the field.<ref name="IOPsych"/>

Industrial organizational psychologists look at questions regarding things such as who to hire, how to define and measure successful job performance, how to prepare people to be more successful in their jobs, how to create and change jobs so that they are safer and make people happier, and how to structure the organization to allow people to achieve their potential.<ref name="IOPsych"/>

=====School psychology=====
{{main|School psychology}}
[[School psychology]] is the area of discipline that is dedicated to helping young people succeed academically, socially, and emotionally. School psychologists collaborate with educators, parents, and other professionals to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments for all students that strengthen connections between home and school. They are trained to be experts in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.<ref>http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx</ref> Currently, school psychology is the only field in which a professional can be called a "psychologist" without a doctoral degree, with the [[National Association of School Psychologists]] (NASP) recognizing the [[Specialist degree]] as the entry level. This is a matter of controversy as the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] does not recognize anything below a doctorate as the entry level for a psychologist. Specialist-level school psychologists, who typically receive three years of graduate training, function almost exclusively within school systems, while those at the doctoral-level are found in a number of other settings as well, including universities, hospitals, clinics, and private practice.

[[Image:wundt.jpg|126px|thumb|right|Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt was a German psychologist, generally acknowledged as a founder of [[experimental psychology]].]]

Research in psychology is conducted in broad accord with the standards of the [[scientific method]], encompassing both [[qualitative research|qualitative]] [[ethology|ethological]] and [[quantitative psychological research|quantitative statistical]] modalities to generate and evaluate [[scientific explanation|explanatory]] [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] with regard to psychological [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. Where research ethics and the state of development in a given research domain permits, investigation may be pursued by [[experiment]]al protocols. Psychology tends to be eclectic, drawing on scientific knowledge from other fields to help explain and understand psychological phenomena. [[Qualitative psychological research]] utilizes a broad spectrum of observational methods, including [[action research]], [[ethography]],  [[exploratory statistics]], [[structured interview|structured]] [[interview]]s, and [[participant observation]], to enable the gathering of rich information unattainable by classical experimentation. Research in [[humanistic psychology]] is more typically pursued by [[ethnography|ethnographic]], [[historical method|historical]], and [[historiography|historiographic]] methods.

The [[psychological testing|testing]] of different aspects of psychological function is a significant area of contemporary psychology. [[Psychometrics|Psychometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] methods predominate, including various well-known standardized tests as well as those created ad hoc as the situation or experiment requires.

Academic psychologists may focus purely on research and psychological theory, aiming to further psychological understanding in a particular area, while other psychologists may work in [[applied psychology]] to deploy such knowledge for immediate and practical benefit. However, these approaches are not mutually exclusive and most psychologists will be involved in both researching and applying psychology at some point during their career. Clinical psychology, among many of the various disciplines of psychology, aims at developing in practicing psychologists knowledge of and experience with research and experimental methods which they will continue to build up as well as employ as they treat individuals with psychological issues or use psychology to help others.

When an area of interest requires specific training and specialist knowledge, especially in applied areas, psychological associations normally establish a governing body to manage training requirements. Similarly, requirements may be laid down for university degrees in psychology, so that students acquire an adequate knowledge in a number of areas. Additionally, areas of practical psychology, where psychologists offer treatment to others, may require that psychologists be licensed by government regulatory bodies as well.

===Controlled experiments===
{{main|Experiment}}
[[Image:Skinner.jpg|126px|thumb|right|[[B.F. Skinner]], pioneer of the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[radical behaviorism]]]]

Experimental psychological research is conducted in a laboratory under controlled conditions. This method of research attempts to rely on an application of scientific methods to understand behavior. Examples of such measurements of behavior include rate of response, [[reaction time]] and various [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurements. In inductive approaches, experiments are designed to test functional relationships. In a hypothetico-deductive approach, experiments are conducted to test a particular [[hypothesis]]. Hypothesis testing was rejected as a productive method of research by B.F.Skinner as being too conducive to speculative theories that would promote useless research and stifle research <ref>Skinner, B.F.: Are Theories of Learning Necessary? http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Theories/ </ref>.

As an example of a psychological experiment, one may want to test people's perception of different [[Pitch (music)|tones]]. Specifically, one could ask the following question: is it easier for people to discriminate one pair of tones from another depending upon their frequency? To answer this, one would want to disprove the hypothesis that all tones are equally discriminable, regardless of their frequency. (See [[hypothesis testing]] for an explanation of why one would disprove a hypothesis rather than attempt to prove one.) A task to test this hypothesis would have a participant seated in a room listening to a series of tones. If the participant would make one indication (by pressing a button, for example) if they thought the tones were two different sounds, and another indication if they thought they were the same sound. The proportion of correct responses would be the measurement used to describe whether or not all the tones were equally discriminable. The result of this particular experiment would probably indicate better discrimination of certain tones based on the human [[Absolute threshold of hearing|threshold of hearing]].

===Longitudinal studies===
A [[longitudinal study]] is a research method which observes a particular population over time. For example, one might wish to study [[specific language impairment]] (SLI) by observing a group of individuals with the condition over a period of time. This method has the advantage of seeing how a condition can affect individuals over long time scales. However, such studies can suffer from attrition due to drop-out or death of subjects. In addition, since individual differences between members of the group are not controlled, it may be difficult to draw conclusions about the populations.

===Neuropsychological methods===
[[Neuropsychology]] involves the study of both healthy individuals and patients, typically who have suffered either [[brain injury]] or [[mental illness]].

[[Cognitive neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuropsychiatry]] study neurological or mental impairment in an attempt to infer theories of normal mind and brain function. This typically involves looking for differences in patterns of remaining ability (known as 'functional disassociation's') which can give clues as to whether abilities are comprised of smaller functions, or are controlled by a single cognitive mechanism.

In addition, experimental techniques are often used which also apply to studying the neuropsychology of healthy individuals. These include behavioral experiments, brain-scanning or [[functional neuroimaging]] - used to examine the activity of the brain during task performance, and techniques such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], which can safely alter the function of small brain areas to investigate their importance in mental operations.

===Computational modeling===
[[computer simulation|Computational modeling]] is a tool often used in [[cognitive psychology]] to simulate a particular behavior using a computer. This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process extremely quickly, many simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for a great deal of statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human.

Several different types of modeling are used to study behavior. [[Connectionism]] uses [[neural nets]] to simulate the brain. Another method is [[symbolic modeling]], which represents many different mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.

==Criticism==
===Controversy as a science===

====dehumanization====
Although modern psychology attempts to be a scientific endeavor, the field has a history of controversy. Some criticisms of psychology have been made on ethical and philosophical grounds. Some have argued that by subjecting the human mind to experimentation and statistical study, psychologists objectify persons. Because it treats human beings as things, as objects that can be examined by experiment, psychology is sometimes portrayed as dehumanizing, ignoring or downplaying what is most essential about being human. This criticism has come from within the field as well, particularly by existential and humanistic psychologists.

====weak methodologies====
A common criticism of psychology concerns its fuzziness as a science. Philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] suggested in [[1962]] that psychology is in a pre-paradigmatic state, lacking the agreement on facts found in mature sciences such as [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. Because some areas of psychology rely on "[[soft science|soft]]" research methods such as surveys and [[questionnaire]]s, critics have claimed that psychology is not as scientific as psychologists assume. Methods such as [[introspection]] and [[psychoanalysis]], used by some psychologists, are inherently [[subjective]]. Objectivity, validity, and rigor are key attributes in science, and some approaches to psychology have fallen short on these criteria. On the other hand, greater use of statistical controls and increasingly sophisticated research design, analysis, and statistical methods, as well as a decline (at least within academic psychology departments) in the use of less scientific methods, have lessened the impact of this criticism to some degree. 

Debates continue, however, such as the questioned effectiveness of probability testing as a valid research tool. The concern is that this statistical method may promote trivial findings as meaningful, especially when large samples are used.<ref>Cohen, J. (1994). The Earth is round, p < .05. ''American Psychologist, 49'',.</ref> Psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics, rather than sole reliance on the traditional ''p<.05'' decision rule.

===Research-practitioner gap===

There is also concern from researchers about a perceived scientific gap between empirically based practices. Exponents of evidence-based approaches to psychological practice say that "over the past several decades, the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, and social work have borne witness to a widening and deeply troubling gap between science and practice" and "less and less of what researchers do finds its way into the consulting room, and less and less of what practitioners do derives from scientific evidence."  Moreover there are many "unvalidated and sometimes harmful psychotherapeutic methods", such as [[neurolinguistic programming]], [[rebirthing]], and [[primal therapy]] that have been promoted within some professional bodies. The fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, and social work have recently placed increased emphasis on evidence-based mental health studies."[http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html] Alan Neuringer essentially made the same point in the field of the experimental analysis of behavior in 1984 <ref>Neuringer, A.:"Melioration and Self-Experimentation" Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1348111</ref>,
