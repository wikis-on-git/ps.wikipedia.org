{{Two other uses||the operating system|هايکو (operating system)|}}
'''{{nihongo|هايکو|[[wikt:俳句|俳句]]}}''' ''{{Audio|Haiku.ogg|listen}}'' is a mode of [[جاپاني شاعري]], the late [[19th century]] revision by [[Masaoka Shiki]] of the older {{nihongo|''hokku''|[[wikt:発句|発句]]}}, the opening verse of a linked verse form, ''[[renga|haikai no renga]]''.  The  traditional hokku consisted of a pattern of approximately 5, 7, 5 [[Onji|on]].  The Japanese word ''on'', meaning "sound", corresponds to a ''[[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]'', a phonetic unit similar but not identical to the [[syllable]] of a language such as [[English language|English]].  (The words ''onji,'' ("sound symbol") or ''moji'' (character symbol) are also sometimes used.)  A haiku contains a special ''season word'' (the ''[[kigo]]'') representative of the season in which the renga is set, or a reference to the natural world. 

هايکو usually combines three different phrases, with a distinct grammatical break, called kireji, usually placed at the end of either the first five or second seven or last five morae. In Japanese, there are actual kireji words. In English, kireji is often replaced with commas, hyphens, elipses, or implied breaks in the haiku. These elements of the older haiku are considered by many to be essential to haiku as well, although they are not always included by modern writers of Japanese "free-form haiku" and of non-Japanese haiku. Japanese haiku are typically written as a single line, while English language haiku are traditionally separated into three lines.

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], nouns do not have different singular and plural forms, so 'haiku' is usually used as both a singular and plural noun in [[English language|English]] as well.

[[Senryu]] is a similar poetry form that emphasizes humor and human foibles instead of seasons, and which may not have kigo or kireji. 



== بېلګې ==
Japanese hokku and haiku are traditionally printed in one vertical line, though in handwritten form they may be in any reasonable number of lines.
*An example of classic hokku by [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]]:
:古池や蛙飛込む水の音　
:Furu ike ya kawazu tobikomu mizu no oto
:An old mere
:When the frogs jump in
:The sound of water
*Another Bashō classic:
:初しぐれ猿も小蓑をほしげ也
:Hatsu shigure saru mo komino wo hoshige nari
:the first cold shower;
:even the monkey seems to want
:a little coat of straw.
[At that time, Japanese rain-gear consisted of a large, round [[hat]] and a shaggy straw [[cloak]].]
*A modern English Haiku (used with permission):
:Grey, smoky London.
:Traffic drone 24/7.
:How do people cope?

== د هايکو اصل او وده ==
=== د رېنګا نه تر هايکای پورې ===
The exact origin of hokku is still subject to debate, but it is generally agreed that it originated from the classical linked verse form called ''[[renga]]'' (連歌). There are two types of renga:
*The short renga, ''tanrenga'', has a 5–7–5 – 7–7 structure.  The first 5–7–5 of a short renga is called ''chōku'' (the longer verse), to which answers the remaining 7–7, ''tanku'' (the shorter verse).  
*The long renga, ''chōrenga'', consists of an alternating succession of chōku and tanku, 36 to 100 verses per volume.  The first verse of a long renga is a chōku (5–7–5) called ''hokku'' (発句, "the opening verse"), the second is a tanku (7–7) called ''waki'', … and the last is a tanku called ''ageku''.

In the [[1400s]] a rising [[middle class]] led to the development of a less courtly linked verse called {{nihongo|'''playful linked verse'''|俳諧の連歌|haikai no renga}}.  The term ''haikai no renga'' first appears in the renga collection Tsukubashu. ''Haiku'' came into being when the opening verse of ''haikai no renga'' was made an independent poem at the end of the 19th century.

The inventors of ''haikai no renga'' (abbr. ''haikai'') are generally considered to be [[Yamazaki Sokan]] ([[1465]]–[[1553]]) and [[Arakida Moritake]] ([[1473]]–[[1549]]).  Later exponents of ''haikai'' were [[Matsunaga Teitoku]] ([[1571]]–[[1653]]), the founder of the Teimon school,  and [[Nishiyama Sōin]] ([[1605]]–[[1682]]), the founder of the Danrin school.  The Teimon school's deliberate colloquialism  made ''haikai'' popular, but also made it depend on wordplay.  To counter this dependence, the Danrin school explored people's daily life for other sources of playfulness, but often ended up with frivolity.   

In the [[1600s]], two masters arose who elevated ''haikai'' and gave it a new popularity.  They were [[Matsuo Bashō]] ([[1644]]–[[1694]]) and [[Onitsura]] ([[1661]]–[[1738]]).  Hokku was only the first verse of ''haikai'', but its position as the opening verse made it the most important, setting the tone for the whole composition.  Even though hokku sometimes appeared individually, they were understood to always be in the context of ''haikai'', if only theoretically.  Bashō and Onitsura were thus writers of ''haikai'' of which hokku was only a part, though the most important part.

=== د باشو (Bashō) وخت ===
Bashō's first known hokku was written when he was eighteen (scholars doubt the authenticity of a supposed earlier hokku written in honor of the Year of the Bird), but it showed little promise, and much of his early verse is little more than the kind of wordplay popular at the time.  The verse generally considered to mark his turning point and departure from the Danrin school came in [[1680]], when he wrote of a crow perched on a bare branch.  Bashō made his living as a teacher of haikai, as a founder of the Shōfu school, and wrote a number of travel journals incorporating hokku.  He was strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism, and is said to have regretted, near the end of his life, devoting more time to haikai than to Buddhist practice.

Onitsura would be far more famous today as a haiku writer contemporary with Bashō, were it not that he, unlike Bashō, had no group of disciples to carry on his teachings.  He wrote hokku of high quality and emphasized truth and sincerity in writing.  Shōfu, Bashō's school of ''haikai'', was carried on by his disciples Kikaku, Ransetsu, Kyorai, Kyoroku, Shikō, Sampū, Etsujin, Yaha, Hokushi, Jōsō and Bonchō.  It became the '' haikai'' standard throughout Japan. Branches founded by his disciples Kikaku (1661–1707) and Ransetsu (1654–1707) still existed in the latter half of the 19th century.

=== د بوسون (Buson) وخت ===
[[دوتنه:YosaBusonGrave.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grave of Yosa Buson]]
The next famous style of haikai to arise was that of [[Yosa Buson]] ([[1716]]–[[1783]]) and others such as Gyōdai, Chora, Rankō, Ryōta, Shōha, Taigi, and Kitō, called the Tenmei style after the [[Tenmei|Tenmei Era]] ([[1781]]–[[1789]]) in which it was created.  Buson was better known in his day as a painter than as a writer of ''haikai'', but today that is reversed.  His affection for painting can be seen in the painterly style of his hokku, and in his attempt to deliberately arrange scenes in words.  Hokku was not so much a serious matter for Buson as it was for Basuuuhō.  The popularity and frequency of haikai gatherings in this period led to greater numbers of verses springing from imagination rather than from actual experience.

No new popular style followed Buson.  A very individualistic approach to ''haikai'' appeared, however, in the writer [[Kobayashi Issa]] ([[1763]]–[[1827]]) whose miserable childhood, [[poverty]], sad life, and devotion to the [[Pure Land]] sect of [[Buddhism]] are clearly present in his hokku.

=== د شيکي (Shiki) راښکاره کېدل ===
After Issa, ''haikai'' entered a period of decline in which it reverted to frivolity and uninspired mediocrity.  The writers of this period in the 19th century are known by the deprecatory term ''tsukinami'', meaning "monthly", after the monthly or twice-monthly ''haikai'' gatherings of the end of the [[18th century]].  But in regard to this period of ''haikai'', it came to mean "trite" and "hackneyed".

This was the situation until the appearance of [[Masaoka Shiki]] ([[1867]]–[[1902]]), a reformer and revisionist who marks the end of hokku in a wider context.  Shiki, a prolific writer even though chronically ill during a significant part of his life, not only disliked the ''tsukinami'' writers, but also criticized Bashō.  Like the Japanese [[intellectual]] world in general at that time, Shiki was strongly impressed by Western culture.  He favored the painterly style of Buson and particularly the European concept of ''plein-air'' [[painting]], which he adapted to create a style of reformed hokku as a kind of nature sketch in words, an approach called ''shasei'', literally "sketching from life".  He popularized his views by verse columns and [[essay]]s in [[newspaper]]s.

All hokku up to the time of Shiki were written in the context of ''haikai'', but Shiki completely separated his new style of verse from wider contexts.  Being [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], he also separated it from the influence of Buddhism with which hokku had very often been tinged.  And finally, he discarded the term "hokku" and called his revised verse form "haiku".  Shiki thus became the first haiku poet.  His revisionism  brought an end to ''haikai'' and hokku as well as to surviving ''haikai'' schools.

=== هايګا (Haiga) ===
[[Haiga]], the combination of haiku and art, is nearly as old as haiku itself. Haiga began as haiku added to paintings, but included in Japan the calligraphic painting of haiku via brushstrokes, with the calligraphy adding to the power of the haiku. Earlier haiku poets added haiku to their paintings, but Bashō is noted for creating haiga paintings as simple as the haiku itself. Yosa Buson, a master painter, brought a more artistic approach to haiga. Haiga poet-artists followed either of these approaches.

Today, artists have combined haiku with paintings, photographs and other art media.

== Haiku in the West ==
Although there were attempts outside Japan to imitate the old hokku in the early [[1900s]], there was little genuine understanding of its principles.  Early Western scholars such as [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]] ([[1850]]–[[1935]]) and [[William George Aston]] were mostly dismissive of hokku's poetic value.  One of the first advocates of English-language hokku was the Japanese poet [[Yone Noguchi]].  In "A Proposal to American Poets," published in the ''Reader'' magazine in February 1904, Noguchi gave a brief outline of the hokku and some of his own English efforts, ending with the exhortation, "Pray, you try Japanese Hokku, my American poets!"  At about the same time the poet [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] was publishing original English-language hokku, as well as other Japanese forms in both English and French.

In France, hokku was introduced by [[Paul-Louis Couchoud]] around 1906.  Couchoud's articles were read by early [[Imagist]] theoretician [[F. S. Flint]], who passed on Couchoud's(somewhat idiosyncratic) ideas to other members of the proto-[[Imagist]] [[Poets' Club]] such as [[Ezra Pound]].  Hokku subsequently had a considerable influence on [[Imagist]]s in the 1910s, but, notwithstanding several efforts by [[Yone Noguchi]] to explain "the hokku spirit" there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.

=== Blyth, Yasuda and Henderson ===
After early Imagist interest in haiku the genre drew less attention in English until after World War II, with the appearance of a number of influential volumes about Japanese haiku.

In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of ''Haiku'', the four-volume work by [[Reginald Horace Blyth|R.&nbsp;H. Blyth]], haiku was introduced to the post-war world. Blyth was an [[Englishman]] who lived first in Japanese-annexed [[Korea]], then in Japan.  He produced a series of works on [[Zen]], haiku, senryu, and on other forms of [[Japanese literature|Japanese]] and Asian literature.  Those most relevant here are his ''Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics'' (1942); his four-volume ''Haiku'' series (1949–52) dealing mostly with pre-modern hokku, though including Shiki; and his two-volume ''History of Haiku'' ([[1964]]).  Today he is best known as a major interpreter of haiku to [[Western civilization|the West]].

Present-day attitudes to Blyth's work vary.  Many contemporary writers of haiku were introduced to the genre through his works. These include the San Francisco and [[Beat Generation]] writers, such as [[Gary Snyder]], [[Jack Kerouac]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]], many of whom have written haiku as well as better-known works. Many members of the international "haiku community" also got their first views of haiku from Blyth's books, including [[James W. Hackett]], William J. Higginson, Anita Virgil and Lee Gurga. In the late twentieth century, members of that community with direct knowledge of modern Japanese haiku often noted Blyth's distaste for haiku on more modern themes, and his strong bias regarding a direct connection between haiku and Zen, a "connection" largely ignored by Japanese poets. (Bashō, in fact, felt that his devotion to haiku prevented him from realizing enlightenment<ref>As documented in Makoto Ueda's ''Literary and Art Theories in Japan'' (Press of Western Reserve U., 1967).</ref>) Blyth also did not view haiku by Japanese women favorably, downplaying their substantial contributions to the genre, especially during the Bashō era and the twentieth century.

Alhough Blyth did not foresee the appearance of original haiku in languages other than Japanese when he began writing on the topic, and although he founded no school of verse, his works stimulated the writing of haiku in English. At the end of the second volume of his ''History of Haiku'' (1964), he remarked that "The latest development in the history of haiku is one which nobody foresaw,— the writing of haiku outside Japan, not in the Japanese language". He followed that comment with several original verses in English by the American James W. Hackett, with whom Blyth corresponded.

In 1957, the Charles E. Tuttle Co., with offices in both Japan and the U.S., published ''The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples'' by the Japanese-American scholar and translator Kenneth Yasuda. The book consists mainly of material from Yasuda's doctoral dissertation at Tokyo University (1955), and includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English which had previously appeared in his book ''A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1947). In ''The Japanese Haiku'', Yasuda presented some Japanese critical theory about haiku, especially featuring comments by early twentieth-century poets and critics. His translations conform to a 5–7–5 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda's theory includes the concept of a "haiku moment", which he said is based in personal experience and provides the motive for writing a haiku. While the rest of his theoretical writing on haiku is not widely discussed, his notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in North America.

The impulse to write haiku in English in North America was probably given more of a push by two books that appeared in 1958 than by Blyth's books directly. His indirect influence was felt through the Beat writers; [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''The Dharma Bums'' appeared in 1958, with one of its main characters, Japhy Ryder (based on Gary Snyder), writing haiku.

Also in 1958, ''An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bashô to Shiki'' by [[Harold G. Henderson]], came from the American publisher Doubleday Anchor Books. This was a careful revision of Henderson's earlier book ''The Bamboo Broom'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1934), which apparently drew little notice as the world spiralled into militarist dictatorships before World War II. (After the war, Henderson and Blyth worked for the American Occupation in Japan and for the Imperial Household, respectively, and their mutual appreciation of haiku helped form a bond between the two, even as they collaborated on communications between their respective employers.<ref>Some of which is documented in ''A Haiku Path: The Haiku Society of America 1968–1988'', published by the Society in 1994.</ref>) 

Henderson translated every hokku and haiku into a [[rhyme]]d [[tercet]] (a-b-a), whereas the Japanese originals never used rhyme. Unlike Yasuda, however, he recognized that seventeen syllables in English are generally longer than the seventeen [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] of a traditional Japanese haiku. Since the normal modes of English poetry depend on accentual metre rather than on syllabics, Henderson chose to emphasize the order of events and images in the originals, rather than counting syllables.

Henderson also welcomed correspondence, and when North Americans began publishing magazines devoted to haiku in English, he encouraged them. Not as dogmatic as Blyth, Henderson insisted only that haiku must be poems, and that the development of haiku in English would be determined by the poets.

=== The budding of American haiku ===
Precisely who qualifies as the first American haiku poet depends on one's definition of haiku. Individualistic "haiku-like" verses by the innovative Buddhist poet and artist [[Paul Reps]] (1895–1990) appeared in print as early as 1939 (''More Power to You – Poems Everyone Can Make'', Preview Publications, Montrose CA.). Other [[Westerner]]s inspired by Blyth's translations attempted original haiku in English, though again generally failing to understand the principles behind the verse form, which in Blyth is predominantly the more challenging hokku rather than the later and more free-form haiku. The resulting verses, including those of the [[Beat poetry|Beat]] period, were often little more than the brevity of the haiku form combined with current ideas of poetic content, or uninformed attempts at "Zen" poetry.  

Nonetheless, these experimental verses expanded the popularity of haiku in English. While never making much of an impact on the literary world, haiku  in America has proven very popular as a system for introducing students to poetry in [[elementary school]]s and as a [[hobby]] for numerous [[amateur]] writers who continue the innovation and experimentation that is the legacy of Shiki's reforms. However, the literary achievement of leading English-language haiku writers should not be underestimated. The [[Haiku Society of America]] was founded in 1968 to promote haiku, and other organizations have arisen. In 1991, the biennial Haiku North America conference was first held in California, and it continues to be the primary meeting ground for leading haiku poets, scholars, and translators on the continent. Poets [[Gerald Vizenor]], [[Gordon Henry, Jr]] and [[Kimberley Blaeser]], meanwhile, have connected the haiku form to the tradition of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]/[[First Nations]] Peoples of the [[Anishinaabe]] tribe, stressing the essential interconnectedness of human and natural "worlds".

Today haiku is written in many languages, but the number of writers is still concentrated primarily in Japan and secondarily in English-speaking countries.

One French critic who arrived at an understanding of haiku was [[Roland Barthes]]. In his 1970 work ''Empire of Signs'', Barthes wrote that the haiku has the simple meaning of a child pointing his finger at something and saying, "this is how it is."

== Contemporary English-language haiku ==
While traditional hokku/haiku focused on [[nature]] and the place of [[human]]s in nature, modern haiku poets often consider any subject matter suitable, whether related to nature, an [[Urbanization|urban]] setting, or even a [[Technology|technological]] context.  While old hokku avoided some topics such as [[Romantic love|romance]], [[sex]], and overt [[violence]], contemporary haiku often deal specifically with such themes.

Traditional hokku/haiku required a long period of learning and maturing, but contemporary haiku is often (and mistakenly) regarded as an "instant" form of brief verse that can be written by anyone, from schoolchildren to [[professional]]s.  Many writers of modern haiku stay faithful to the standards of old hokku, however some other contemporary haiku poets have dropped such standards, emphasizing personal freedom and pursuing ongoing exploration in both form and subject matter. 

Due to the various views and practices today, it is impossible to single out any current style or format or subject matter as definitive "haiku".  Nonetheless, some of the more common practices in English are:
* Use of three (or fewer) lines of no more than 17 syllables in total;
* Use of a season word ([[kigo]]);
* Use of a [[caesura]] or a punctuation mark to implicitly contrast and compare two events, images or situations.

The poet-critic Bob Grumman,<ref> Modern Haiku (“A Divergery of Haiku, ToxanAtomyzd,”) 34:2,  2003, 20–26</ref> applies the word haiku to his own brief, mathematical "poems," ("mathemaku") and to visual poetry by Scott Helms. This stretching of the definition of haiku is considered by others to be excessive, but Grumman defends his position by pointing to what he perceives, with absolutely no evidence but his own assertions, to be a similar blurring of definitional boundaries in Japan.  In short, with no knowledge of Japanese, or access to current Japanese journals, Bob Grummen attempts to justify the misapplication of the word haiku by positing evidence that does not exist.    

At the start of the 21st century, there is a thriving community of haiku poets worldwide, mainly communicating through national societies and journals in English-speaking countries (Blithe Spirit, Presence, Modern Haiku, Snapshots, Frogpond, Heron's Nest, Yellow Moon, Shamrock and many more), in Japan, in Northern Europe (mainly Sweden, Germany, France and The Netherlands), in the Balkans (mainly Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania), and in Russia.

=== انترنت ===
Both haiku and hokku writers and verses, as well as huge volumes of pseudo-haiku, can be found online.  A search will lead to many forums where both new and experienced poets learn, share, discuss and freely criticize.

In the early days of the Internet, much of the development of haiku on-line stemmed from the ''Shiki Internet Haiku Salon''. This site began an email list for haiku poets in 1994, which continues to operate in 2006. This development enabled haiku poets from across the world to communicate more easily, an important development for those haijin who are geographically isolated from like-minded poets.  
In [[1995]], the [[scifaiku]] (science fiction haiku) form was invented by Tom Brinck.
In early [[1998]], [[Salon.com]] published the [http://www.salon.com/21st/chal/1998/02/10chal2.html results of a haiku contest] on the topic of [[computer]] error messages. The winning verses ([[senryu]] to be precise) were:
:Three things are certain:
:Death, taxes, and lost data.
:Guess which has occurred.
:::: — David Dixon
:Everything is gone;
:Your life's work has been destroyed.
:Squeeze trigger (yes/no)?
:::: — David Carlson 

There are online computerized systems for generating random haiku-like verse; there are "Spamku," (verses about [[SPAM (food)|SPAM]] – a brand of tinned meat) as well as many other clever variations on the brevity of the haiku form.

On the [[Macromedia Flash]] cartoon website, [[Homestar Runner]], for Halloween 2004, the character of [[Strong Sad]] was featured at a booth reciting such haiku as:
:Rapping at the door
:Fills up agèd pillowcase
:So sick of Smarties

Many [[social networking]] sites on the internet allow their users to express themselves creatively in many forms including haiku poetry. A good example of such would be the following 5–7–5 "haiku" submitted to [[Threadless]] (note 'haikus', the non-existent plural form of the word 'haiku'!):
:Haikus are easy 	 
:But sometimes they don't make sense 	 
:Refrigerator

=== Television ===

Witty haiku-like (or rather senryu-like) poems, often satirizing the form itself, have appeared in popular TV programs such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]''. and an episode of [[That 70's Show]].

Butt-Head:
:That was cool huh huh
:When we killed that frog huh huh
:It won't croak again

=== Novels ===
[[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' opens with a haiku narrated by Bobby Shaftoe, one of the main characters:
:Two tires fly. Two wail.
:A bamboo grove, all chopped down.
:From it, warring songs.
Throughout the course of the novel, Bobby Shaftoe writes many haiku describing his experiences in [[World War II]].

In [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s novel ''[[Fight Club]]'' the unnamed protagonist utilizes haiku poems to illustrate his beliefs on modern consumerism and his own ''zen-ness'' which he disseminates to his co-workers through the use of inter office e-mails.
:Worker bees can leave.
:Even drones can fly away.
:The queen is their slave.

=== Video games ===

In [[1996]], a group of ''[[Quake]]'' players started writing "Quaiku" poetry, often evoking various ideas from a Quake player's life. [http://que.planetquake.gamespy.com/haiku/haiku1.htm]

The character [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]] in the game ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'', for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]], had his own Haiku.
:Like the moon over 
:the day, my genius and brawn 
:are lost on these fools. ~haiku (Bowser)

Haiku (or, more appropriately, satires thereof) also play a large role in the online adventure game ''[[Kingdom of Loathing]]''. There is a Haiku Dungeon in which all adventures are written in haiku, and an in-game chat channel in which everyone must speak in haiku.

In addition, the characters in one level of ''[[Spyro: Year of the Dragon]]'', for [[PlayStation]], speak exclusively in freestyle haiku.

[[Slayer (Guilty Gear)|Slayer]] from ''[[Guilty Gear (series)|Guilty Gear]]'' says that he enjoys haikus; even in his Instant Kill he'll say a haiku.
=== Music ===
The american band [[Tally Hall (band)|Tally Hall]] wrote a song about writing a haiku.[http://www.tallyhall.com/discography.php] The whole song is sung in Haikus with pauses in between them.

=== Non-Japanese poets ===
Although all of the poets below have some haiku in print, only Hackett and Virgilio are known primarily for haiku. Richard Wright, known for his novel "''Native Son''", wrote some 4000 haiku in the last eighteen months of his life. Although few were published during his lifetime, in [[1998]] ''HAIKU: This Other World'' was published with the 817 haiku that he preferred.  Amiri Baraka recently authored a collection of what he calls "low coup," his own variant of the haiku form. Poet Sonia Sanchez is also known for her unconventional blending of haiku and the blues musical genre.
