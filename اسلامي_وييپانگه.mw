{{Islam}}
The following list consists of [[concept]]s that are derived from both [[Islamic culture|Islamic]] and [[Arab]] tradition, which are expressed as words in the [[Arabic language]]. The main purpose of this list is to disambiguate multiple spellings, to make note of spellings no longer in use for these concepts, to define the concept in one or two lines, to make it easy for one to find and pin down specific concepts, and to provide a guide to unique concepts of Islam all in one place. 

Separating concepts in Islam from concepts specific to Arab [[culture]], or from the language itself, can be difficult. Many [[Arabic]] concepts have an Arabic secular meaning as well as an Islamic meaning. One example is the concept of [[dawah]]. One of the complexities of the Arabic language is that a single word can have multiple meanings. The word ''[[Islam]]'' is itself a good example. 

Readers should also note that Arabic is written in its own [[alphabet]], with letters, symbols, and [[Orthography|orthographic]] conventions that do not have exact equivalents in the [[Latin alphabet]] (see [[Arabic alphabet]]). The following list is a [[transliteration]] of Arabic terms and phrases. Consequently, [[Muslim]]s may transliterate certain Arabic words differently, such as ''din'' as opposed to ''deen'', and ''aqidah'' as opposed to ''aqeedah''. Most items in the list also contain their actual Arabic spelling.

== Notes ==
*[[Arabic language|Arabic]] words are created from [[Triliteral|three-letter "roots"]] which convey a basic idea. For example, k-t-b conveys the idea of writing. Addition of other letters before, between, and after the root letters produces many associated words: not only "write" but also "book", "office", "library", and "author". The abstract consonantal root for Islam is s-l-m.
<!---- *The English word [[algorithm]] is derived from the name of the inventor of [[algebra]]; an Arabic word like [[alchemy]], [[alcohol]], [[azimuth]], [[nadir]], [[zenith]] and [[oasis]], which mean the same as in English.[[Arabic numerals]] are what we use in English ("0", "1", "2",...). Modern Arabs generally use the [[Hindi numerals]].---> 
*Some Islamic concepts are usually referred to in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkic]]. Those are typically of later origin than the concepts listed here; for completeness it may be best to list Persian terms and those unique to Shi'a on their own page, likewise Turkic terms and those unique to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period on their own page, as these are culturally very distinct.
* The word "crusade" in English is usually translated in Arabic as "Hamlah Ssaleebiyah" which means literally "campaign of Cross-holders" (or close to that meaning). In Arabic text it is "حملة صليبية" and the second word comes from "Ssaleeb" which means "cross."
* The verses in the Qur'an that Christians usually refer to as ''jihad'' verses have the phrase "''qitl fee sybil Allah''" (fight/kill for the sake of Allah).
* Westerners use the terms non-observant (secular), fundamentalist, extremist, reformist or moderate to refer to differing Muslim practices. Muslims use the terms tableeghi, takfiri, ikhwani, shirazzi.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}
