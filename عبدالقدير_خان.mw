[[Dr.]] [[prof.]] '''Abdul Qadeer Khan''' or ''' A. Q. Khan'''- Hilal-i-Imtiaz ([[Hilal-i-Imtiaz|HI]]), Nishan-i-Imtiaz ([[Nishan-i-Imtiaz|NI]]) (twice), ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''عبدالقدیر خان'''}}}}; born April 27, 1936 in [[Bhopal]], [[British India]]) is a [[Pakistani]] [[nuclear scientist]] and [[metallurgical engineer]], widely regarded as the founder of [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan's nuclear program]]. His middle name is occasionally rendered as '''Quadeer''', '''Qadir''' or '''Qadeer''', and his given names are usually abbreviated to '''A.Q.''' Khan is perhaps better known in much of the world for his involvement in nuclear proliferation - involvement in acquiring critical nuclear technology designs and using them to build Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, as well as selling this technology to [[Libya]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. Some of his critics have described him as the "[[Klaus Fuchs]] of Pakistan".<ref>http://www.chowk.com/interacts/7187/1/0/48</ref>

In January 2004, Khan confessed to having been involved in an international network of [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons technology proliferation]] from [[Pakistan]] to [[Libya]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. However, owing to domestic pressure from radical groups, on February 5, 2004, the [[President of Pakistan]], General [[Pervez Musharraf]], announced that he had [[pardon]]ed Khan. Khan is widely seen as a national hero in Pakistan.<ref name="Broad">William J. Broad, David E. Sanger, and Raymond Bonner, "A Tale of Nuclear Proliferation: How Pakistani Built His Network", ''New York Times'' (12 February 2004): A1.</ref>

In an August 23, 2005 interview with [[Kyodo News]] General Pervez Musharraf confirmed that Khan had supplied [[gas centrifuge]]s and gas centrifuge parts to North Korea and, possibly, an amount of [[uranium hexafluoride]].<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/2005/08/25/top3.htm "Dr AQ Khan provided centrifuges to N. Korea"], ''Dawn'', 25 August 2005</ref>

In interviews from May through July 2008, Khan recanted his previous confession of his involvement with Iran and North Korea. He said President Pervez Musharraf forced him to be a "scapegoat" for the "national interest."<ref>[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4964884&page=1 ABC News: ABC Exclusive: Pakistani Bomb Scientist Breaks Silence]</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/30/pakistan Extracts from an telephone interview conducted by the Guardian's correspondent, Declan Walsh]</ref> Khan accuses the Pakistan Army and President Musharraf of proliferating nuclear arms.<ref name="dawn.com">Dr A.Q Khan's accusation of Pervez Musharraf being involved in transferring nuclear technology to North Korea, Dawn, 2008-07-05[http://www.dawn.com/2008/07/05/top1.htm]</ref> He said centrifuges were sent from Pakistan in a North Korean plane loaded under the supervision of Pakistani security officials.

[[Islamabad High Court]] on [[February 6]], [[2009]] declared Dr. A. Q. Khan as a free citizen of [[Pakistan]] with freedom of movement inside the country. The verdict was rendered by [[Sardar Muhammad Aslam|Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Aslam]].<ref>http://geo.tv/2-6-2009/34508.htm</ref>

==Early life==

Khan was born in a Malik family in [[Bhopal]], [[India]] in [[1936]]. In 1947 the family, emigrated from [[India]] to [[Pakistan]]. Khan studied in [[St. Anthony's High School]] and then enrolled at the [[D. J. Science College]] of [[Karachi]], where he studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] under the supervision of noted [[solar physicist]] dr. [[Bashir Syed]]. He obtained a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree in 1960 from the [[University of Karachi]], majoring in [[Metallurgy|physical metallurgy]]. After his graduation, he worked as an [[inspector]] of weight and measures in [[Karachi]]. In 1961, he resigned from his position and flew to [[West Germany]] to study [[metallurgical engineering]] at a technical university there.  He then obtained an [[engineer's degree]] in 1967 from [[Delft University of Technology]], [[the Netherlands]], and a [[Doctor of Engineering|Ph.D.]] degree in [[metallurgical engineering]] under the supervision of dr. Martin Brabers from the [[Catholic University of Leuven]] in [[Belgium]]<ref>About Dr. Khan's education, achievements and research test http://www.draqkhan.com.pk/about.htm</ref>, just outside of Brussels, in 1972.

== Work in the Netherlands ==
In 1972, the year he received his PhD, Khan joined the staff of the Physical Dynamics Research Laboratory (FDO) in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands. FDO was a subcontractor for [[Urenco Group|URENCO]], the uranium enrichment facility at [[Almelo]] in the Netherlands, which had been established in 1970 by the [[United Kingdom]], [[West Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] to assure a supply of [[enriched uranium]] for the European [[nuclear reactor]]s. The URENCO facility used [[Zippe-type centrifuge]] technology to separate the fissionable [[isotope]] [[uranium-235]] out of [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas by spinning a mixture of the two isotopes at up to 100,000 revolutions a minute. The technical details of these centrifuge systems are regulated as secret information by export controls because they could be used for the purposes of [[nuclear proliferation]]. 

In May 1974, [[India]] carried out its first [[nuclear test]], codenamed ''[[Smiling Buddha]]'', to the great alarm of the Government of Pakistan. Around this time, Khan having a distinguished career and being one of the most senior scientists at the nuclear plant he worked at, had privileged access to the most restricted areas of the URENCO facility as well as to documentation on the gas centrifuge technology. India's surprise nuclear test and the subsequent Pakistani scramble to establish a deterrent caused great alarm to the Pakistani government as well as the Pakistani diaspora including individuals like Khan.  A subsequent investigation by the Dutch authorities found that he had passed highly-classified material to a network of Pakistani intelligence agents; however, they found no evidence that he was sent to the [[Netherlands]] as a spy nor were they able to determine whether he approached the Government of Pakistan about espionage first or whether they had approached him.  In December 1975, after having stolen the gas centrifuge blueprints, Khan suddenly left the [[Netherlands]]; he returned to Pakistan in 1976.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4145164.stm "AQ Khan relative held over attack"], ''BBC News'', 12 August 2005</ref>. 

The former Dutch Prime Minister, [[Ruud Lubbers]], said in early August 2005 that the Government of the [[Netherlands]] knew of Khan "stealing" the secrets of nuclear technology but let him go on at least two occasions after the [[CIA]] expressed their wish to continue monitoring his movements.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=22629 "CIA asked us to let nuclear spy go, Ruud Lubbers claims"], ''Expactica'', 9 August 2005</ref><ref>William J. Broad, David E. Sanger, and Raymond Bonner, "A Tale of Nuclear Proliferation: How Pakistani Built His Network", New York Times (12 February 2004): A1.[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E1D6133AF931A25751C0A9629C8B63]</ref>

== Relationship with Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ==
Khan did have a good and mutual relationship with [[Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].  After India’s first successful nuclear test on May 18, 1974. Khan, at this time working in a centrifuge production facility in [[the Netherlands]], began to approach [[Pakistani]] [[government]] [[representatives]] to offer help with Pakistan’s nuclear program. At first, he approached a pair of [[Pakistani]] [[military]] [[scientist]]s who were in [[the Netherlands]] on business. In spite of his offers, the Pakistani [[military]] [[scientist]]s discouraged him by saying: "As a [[metallurgical engineer]], it would be a hard job for him to find a job in [[PAEC]] ([[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]])". 

Undaunted, Khan wrote a letter to [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. His letter addressed to Prime Minister [[Bhutto]] that "he sets out his experience and encourages [[Prime Minister]] [[Bhutto]] to make a nuclear bomb using uranium, rather than plutonium, the method Pakistan is currently trying to adopt under the leadership of [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]". 

On December, 1974, Khan came back to Pakistan to meet Prime Minister Bhutto and [[PAEC]] Chairman [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], where he tried to convince Bhutto to adopt his [[Uranium]] route rather than [[Plutonium]] route. Bhutto did not agree to halt the plutonium route but decided on the spot to place Khan in charge of the uranium program as a parallel nuclear program advantage.<ref>http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=zulfikar_ali_bhutto_1</ref> Later that evening, Bhutto met with his close friend and PAEC Chairman Mr. [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] in his house, where he told him that that "He [Abdul Qadeer Khan] seems to make sense."

Abdul Qadeer Khan has praised Bhutto in his columns and numerous education-purpose conferences. In an interview with [[Jang Group of Newspapers]], a leading Pakistani news paper, Khan praised Bhutto and his daughter [[Benazir Bhutto]] in which he said "Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benazir Bhutto are credited in helping Pakistan to acquired nuclear technology." He also said "Despite international pressure, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto acted like a wall and due to his efforts, Pakistan achieved sensitive [[nuclear technology]] in a short time."<ref>http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/may2009-daily/28-05-2009/update.htm#86</ref>

==Development of nuclear weapons==
{{Main|Project-706}}
In 1976, Khan and [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Zahid Ali Akbar]] were put in charge of Pakistan's uranium enrichment program with the support of the then [[prime minister|Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. The [[uranium]] [[enrichment]] program was announced in 1972 and the work itself began in 1974 by the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] ([[PAEC]]) as Project-706 under the guidance of [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], Khan joined the project in the spring of 1976. Khan took over the project from another [[Pakistani]] [[nuclear engineer]], [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood]] in the same year. In July of that year, he took over the project from [[PAEC]] and re-named the enrichment project as the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|Engineering Research Laboratories]] ([[ERL]]) at [[Kahuta]], [[Rawalpindi]], subsequently, renamed the [[Khan Research Laboratories]] ([[KRL]]) by the then [[President of Pakistan]], [[General]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]].  The [[laboratories]] became the focal point for developing a [[uranium enrichment]] capability for [[Pakistan]]'s [[nuclear weapons]] development programme.

== Competing Against Munir Ahmad Khan and PAEC ==
But [[Kahuta Research Laboratories]] led by Khan was not mandated or involved with the actual design, development and testing of Pakistan's nuclear weapons which was the responsibility of [[PAEC]]. Nor was [[Kahuta Research Laboratories]] responsible for developing the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, which comprised of uranium exploration, mining, refining and the production of [[yellow cake]] as well as the conversion of [[yellow cake]] into [[uranium]] [[hexafluoride]] gas which is the feed material for enrichment and nuclear fuel fabrication or the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle comprising the civil and military nuclear reactor projects and the reprocessing program, all of which was developed and led from 1972 onwards by [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] under Mr. [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]. 

Khan initially worked under [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] ([[PAEC]]), headed by [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], for a short period. But the pair fell out, and in July 1976, [[Prime Minister]] [[Bhutto]] gave Khan autonomous control of the [[uranium]] enrichment project, reporting directly to the Prime Minister's office, which the arrangement has continued since Khan founded the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|Engineering Research Laboratories]] ([[ERL]]) on 31 July 1976, with the exclusive task of indigenous development of [[Uranium]] Enrichment Plant. Within the next five years the target would be achieved.<ref name="globalsecurity.org">http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/pakistan/khan.htm</ref> 

[[Kahuta Research Laboratories]], led by Khan and the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]], which was led by [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] created a tough [[institutional]] rivalry against each other. Khan  was also a staunch [[critic]] of [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]'s work. The Monthly Atlantic described Mr. [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and Abdul Qadeer Khan as a "''mortal enemy''" of each other. According to the The Monthly Atlantic, A.Q. Khan tried to convince [[Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] that [[Uranium]] route would be faster than [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]'s pursuit of [[plutonium]] reprocessing, then under way.<ref name="theatlantic.com">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/aq-khan/3</ref> However, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and his team of [[nuclear engineer]]s and [[nuclear physicist]]s at the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] believed that they could run the reactor without Canadian assistance, and they insisted that with the French extraction plant in the offing, Pakistan should stick with its original plan. [[Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] did not disagree, but he saw the advantage of mounting a parallel effort toward enriched [[uranium]] and decided on the spot to place A.Q. Khan in charge.<ref name="theatlantic.com" />

In the early 1980s, Khan's Kahuta Research Laboratories also sought to develop nuclear weapons in competition with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and claimed to have carried out at least one cold test in 1983, but it seems that this effort did not prove to be successful since the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission led by [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] had carried out the first cold test of a working nuclear device on March 11, 1983, and in the following years continued to carry out 24 cold tests of different weapons designs. That is why the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission also conducted the 1998 nuclear tests for Pakistan at Chagai and Kharan.

Kahuta Research Laboratories also launched other weapons development projects in competition with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission such as the development of the nuclear weapons-capable [[Ghauri missile]]. In early 1980s, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission was developing the [[solid]]-[[fuel]]led [[Shaheen]] [[ballistic missile]]. In competition with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, A.Q. Khan's Kahuta Lab. sought develop the [[liquid]]-[[fuel]]led [[Ghauri]] ballistic missile. Kahuta also sat up its own laboratories and produced its both Low-Enriched Uranium [LEU] and Highly Enriched Uranium [HEU] in competition with the PAEC.

The competition between [[KRL]] and [[PAEC]] became highly intense when [[India]] tested its nuclear test, [[Pokhran-II]] in 1998. India's second nuclear test caused a great alarm in [[Pakistan]] but the situation in Pakistan became more critical when then-[[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Nawaz Sharif]] came into intense public pressure from Pakistani society to reply to [[India]] by conducting its own nuclear tests. Abdul Qadeer Khan repeatedly met with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] in which he tried to get Prime Minister's permission to test Pakistan's nuclear weapons in Chagai. Despite his efforts, Nawaz Sharif instead granted permission to [[PAEC]], under Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] to test country's first nuclear test. The decision made by Nawaz Sharif was questioned by the Pakistani civil society. However, Nawaz Sharif avoided an intense rivalry between PAEC and KRL and asked A.Q. Khan to provide KRL's enriched uranium to the PAEC to test Pakistan's first nuclear tests in 1998. Nawaz Sharif also urged both KRL and PAEC to work together in the national interest of country. It was the enriched uranium in KRL that ultimately led to the successful detonation of Pakistan's first nuclear device on 28 May 1998.<ref name="globalsecurity.org" /> Two days later, on May 30 1998, PAEC tested a [[Plutonium]]-based nuclear device, according to a Pakistani defense analyst, the plutonium-based device was much powerful than Uranium device.

== Relationships with the Pakistan Armed Forces==
According to the [[Mass media|media]] reports, it said that A.Q. Khan had an extremely close relationship with [[President]] [[Mohammad Zia ul-Haq]] and the [[Military of Pakistan]]. Khan had also maintained an extremely close relationships with the [[Pakistan Air Force]].

[[Khan Research Laboratories]], as it was now known as, occupied a unique role in [[Pakistani industry|Pakistan Defense Industry]], reporting directly to the office of the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] and having extremely close relations with the [[Military of Pakistan]]. The former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] (late) once mentioned that during her term of office, even she was not allowed to visit [[Khan Research Laboratories]]. After President Zia-ul-Haq death, Khan sought to develop a close and friendly relationship with Pakistan's [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)]] [[General]] (r) [[Mirza Aslam Beg]]. According to Khan, General [[Mirza Aslam Beg]] was aware of the selling of [[nuclear technology]] to [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]] and one of his top-trusted [[general]] was supervising it.

Khan has praised [[President]] [[Zia ul-Haq]] in his columns and numerous conferences. In an interview with [[Jang Group of Newspapers]], Khan paid a tribute to General Zia-ul-Haq, in which he said "President General Zia-ul-Haq (late) is responsible in helping Pakistan acquire sensitive nuclear technology. He also said that he made significant contributions towards the country's nuclear program.

== Heading Kahuta Research Laboratories and Khan Labs ==
Pakistan's establishment of its own uranium enrichment capability was so rapid that international suspicion was raised as to whether there was outside assistance to this program. It was reported that [[China|Chinese]] [[technicians]] had been at the facility in the early 1980s, but suspicions soon fell on Khan's activities at URENCO. In 1983, Khan was sentenced ''in absentia'' to four years in prison by an Amsterdam court for attempted espionage; the sentence was later overturned at an appeal on a [[legal technicality]]. Khan rejected any suggestion that Pakistan had illicitly acquired nuclear expertise: "All the research work [at Kahuta] was the result of our innovation and struggle," he told a group of Pakistani librarians in 1990. "We did not receive any technical know-how from abroad, but we cannot reject the use of books, magazines, and research papers in this connection."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 1987, a British newspaper reported that Khan had confirmed Pakistan's acquisition of a nuclear weapons development capability, by his saying that the U.S. intelligence report "about our possessing the bomb (nuclear weapon) is correct and so is speculation of some foreign newspapers".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Khan's statement was disavowed by the Government of Pakistan. and initially he denied giving it, but he later retracted his denial. In October 1991, the Pakistani newspaper ''Dawn'' reported that Khan had repeated his claim at a dinner meeting of businessmen and industrialists in Karachi, which "sent a wave of jubilation" through the audience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Western governments became increasingly convinced that covert nuclear and ballistic missile collaboration was taking place between China, Pakistan, and [[North Korea]]. According to the [[Washington Post]], "U.S. intelligence operatives secretly rifled Dr. A.Q. [Khan's] luggage ... during an overseas trip in the early 1980s to find the first concrete evidence of Chinese collaboration with Pakistan's [nuclear] bomb effort: a drawing of a crude, but highly reliable, Hiroshima-sized [nuclear] weapon that must have come directly from Beijing, according to the U.S. officials."  In October 1990, the activities of KRL led to the United States terminating economic and military aid to Pakistan, following this, the Government of Pakistan agreed to a freeze in its nuclear weapons development program. But Khan, in a July 1996 interview with the Pakistani weekly ''Friday Times'', said that "at no stage was the program [of producing nuclear weapons-grade enriched uranium] ever stopped".<ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/facility/kahuta.htm Kahuta, Khan Research Laboratories, A.Q. Khan Laboratories, Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL)], [[Federation of American Scientists]] (FAS), accessed July 3, 2007</ref>

== Nuclear Proliferation and Rise to Fame ==
The American clampdown may have prompted an increasing reliance on Chinese and North Korean nuclear and missile expertise. In 1995, the U.S. Government learned that KRL had bought 5,000 specialized magnets from a Chinese Government-owned company, for use in the uranium enrichment equipment. More worryingly, it was reported that the Pakistani nuclear weapons technology was being exported to other states aspirant of nuclear weapons, notably, [[North Korea]]. In May 1998, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine published an article alleging that Khan had offered to sell nuclear know-how to [[Iraq]], an allegation that he denied. [[United Nations]] arms inspectors apparently discovered documents discussing Dr. Khan's purported offer in Iraq; Iraqi officials said the documents were authentic but that they had not agreed to work with Khan, fearing it was a sting operation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} A few weeks later, both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests (''[[Pokhran-II]]'' and ''[[Chagai-I]]'', respectively) that confirmed both countries' development of nuclear weapons. The tests were greeted with jubilation in both countries; in Pakistan, dr. Khan was feted as a national hero. The [[President of Pakistan]], [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]], awarded a [[Nishan-e-Imtiaz]] second time to him for his role in masterminding the Pakistani nuclear weapons development programme. The United States immediately imposed sanctions on both India and Pakistan and publicly blamed China for assisting Pakistan.

==Involvement in Pakistan's Space Program ==
After his active role in Pakistan's nuclear program Khan sought to re-organize and revitalize the Pakistani's national space agency, [[SUPARCO]].  In the late of 1990s, Khan was actively and heavily involved in Pakistan's space program, especially the [[Satellite Launch Vehicle]] ([[SLV]]) and Pakistan's first [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] ([[PSLV]]) project. He also worked closely with [[SUPARCO]]'s scientists in development and construction of Pakistan's first indigenously constructed launch facility and [[space port]], [[Tilla Satellite Launch Center]] at Tilla District. 

In 1999, Khan met with then-chief executive of Pakistan [[General]] [[Pervez Mushrraf]] with his indigenously self-designed [[Low Earth orbit]] ([[LEO]]) [[satellite]]. He briefed chief executive of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]]. 

He also suggested that Pakistan should launch a [[satellite]] from its own [[space center]]s and satellite launch centers. But [[General]] [[Musharraf]] seemed not to agree with him and did not grant him permission to develop his satellite. He was highly disappointed and he wrote about it in his column.<ref>http://draqkhan.com.pk/index.php/2008/11/the-past-and-the-present-12-nov-2008/#more-3</ref>

In March 2001, Khan announced that Pakistani scientists were in the process of building the country's first [[Satellite Launch Vehicle]] ([[SLV]]) and that the project had been assigned to [[SUPARCO]], which also built the [[Badr-1|Badr]] [[satellites]]. Khan also cited the fact that [[India]] had made rapid strides in the fields of [[SLV]] and [[satellite]] [[manufacture]] as another motivation for developing an indigenous launch capabilities.<ref>http://www.defence.pk/forums/defence-industry-technology/967-pakistan-space-satellite-developments.html</ref> He tried to convinced then-[[President of Pakistan]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] to launch the satellite from Pakistan. On December 10, 2001, despite his efforts, Pakistan launched its second  [[Low Earth orbit]] ([[LEO]]) [[satellite]] from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], [[Kazakhstan]] aboard a [[Russia]]n [[Zenit-2]].

==Investigations into Pakistan's nuclear proliferation==
Khan's open promotion of Pakistan's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities became something of an embarrassment to Pakistan's government. The [[United States]] government became increasingly convinced that [[Pakistan]] was trading nuclear weapons technology to [[North Korea]] in exchange for ballistic missile technology. In the face of strong U.S. criticism, the Pakistani government announced in March 2001 that Khan was to be dismissed from his post as [[Chairman]] of [[Kahuta Research Laboratories]], a move that drew strong criticism from the religious and nationalist opposition to [[Pervez Musharraf]]. Perhaps in response to this, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed Khan to the post of Special Science and Technology Adviser to the [[President]], with the status of federal minister. While this could be regarded as a promotion for Khan, it removed him from hands-on management of KRL and gave the government an opportunity to keep a closer eye on his activities. In 2002, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' quoted unnamed "senior Pakistani Government officials" as conceding that Khan's dismissal from KRL had been prompted by the U.S. government's suspicions of his involvement in nuclear weapons technology transfers with North Korea. 

Khan came under renewed scrutiny following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the U.S. and the subsequent [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]] to oust the fundamentalist [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]]. It emerged that [[al-Qaeda]] had made repeated efforts to obtain nuclear weapons materials to build either a [[radiological bomb]] or a crude nuclear bomb. In late October 2001, the Pakistani government arrested three Pakistani chief nuclear scientists, all with close ties to Khan, for their suspected connections with the Taliban.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] continued to investigate Pakistani nuclear weapons proliferation, ratcheting up the pressure on the Pakistani government in 2001 and 2002 and focusing on Khan's personal role. It was alleged in December 2002 that U.S. intelligence officials had found evidence that an unidentified agent, supposedly acting on Khan's behalf, had offered nuclear weapons expertise to Iraq in the mid-1990s, though Khan strongly denied this allegation and the Pakistani government declared the evidence to be "fraudulent". The United States responded by imposing sanctions on KRL, citing concerns about ballistic missile technology transfers.

==2003 revelations from Iran and Libya==
[[Image:Pakistan libya.jpg|thumb|250px|In 2003, [[Libya]] gave up nuclear weapons-related material including these [[centrifuge]]s that were acquired from Pakistan's AQ Khan nuclear "black market".<ref>[http://usinfo.org/zhtw/E-JOURNAL/EJ_Nuclear/desutter.htm Libya Renounces Weapons of Mass Destruction]</ref>]]
In August 2003, reports emerged of dealings with [[Iran]]; it was claimed that Khan had offered to sell nuclear weapons technology to that country as early as 1989. The Iranian government came under intense pressure from the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] to make a full disclosure of its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear programme]] and, finally, agreed in October 2003 to accept tougher investigations from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. The IAEA reported that Iran had established a large uranium enrichment facility using gas centrifuges based on the "stolen" URENCO designs, which had been obtained "from a foreign intermediary in 1987." The intermediary was not named but many diplomats and analysts pointed to [[Pakistan]] and, specifically, to Dr. Khan, who was said to have visited [[Iran]] in 1986. The Iranians turned over the names of their suppliers and the international inspectors quickly identified the Iranian gas centrifuges as Pak-1's, the model of intense [HEU] that was indegeniously developed by Dr. Khan in the early 1980s. In December 2003, two senior staff members at [[Khan Labs]] or KL were arrested on suspicion of having sold nuclear weapons technology to the [[Iran]]ians.

Also in December 2003, [[Libya]] made a surprise announcement that it had weapons of mass destruction programmes which it would now abandon. [[Libya]]n government officials were quoted as saying that Libya had bought nuclear components from various black market dealers, including [[Pakistani]] nuclear scientists. U.S. officials who visited the Libyan uranium enrichment plants shortly afterwards reported that the gas centrifuges used there were very similar to the Iranian ones. The IAEA officials also visited to the Libyan nuclear plant where they found the models of Paksat-1. The [[Interpol]] police also arrested three [[Swiss]] nuclear scientists, who were known to be  Khan's close associate and friends.

==Dismissal, confession, and pardon==
=== Investigation and confession ===
The Pakistani government's blanket denials became untenable as evidence mounted of illicit nuclear weapons technology transfers. It opened an investigation into Khan's activities, arguing that even if there had been wrongdoing, it had occurred without the Government of Pakistan's knowledge or approval.  But critics noted that virtually all of Khan's overseas travels, to Iran, Libya, North Korea, Niger, Mali, and the Middle East, were on official Pakistan government aircraft which he commandeered at will, given the status he enjoyed in Pakistan.  Often, he was accompanied by senior members of the Pakistan nuclear establishment.

Although he was not arrested, Khan was summoned for "debriefing". On January 25, 2004, Pakistani investigators reported that Khan and Mohammed Farooq, a high-ranking manager at KRL, had provided unauthorised technical assistance to Iran's nuclear weapons program in the late 1980s and early 1990s, allegedly in exchange for tens of millions of dollars. General [[Mirza Aslam Beg]], a former Chief of Army Staff at the time, was also said to have been implicated; the ''Wall Street Journal'' quoted U.S. government officials as saying that Khan had told the investigators that the nuclear weapons technology transfers to Iran had been authorised by General Mirza Aslam Beg.<ref>John Lancaster and Kamran Khan, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A6884-2004Feb2 Musharraf Named in Nuclear Probe: Senior Pakistani Army Officers Were Aware of Technology Transfers, Scientist Says"], ''Washington Post'', February 3, 2004 </ref>. On January 31, Khan was dismissed from his post as the Science Adviser to the President of Pakistan, ostensibly to "allow a fair investigation" of the nuclear weapons technology proliferation allegations.

In early February 2004, the Government of Pakistan reported that Khan had signed a confession indicating that he had provided Iran, Libya, and North Korea with designs and technology to aid in nuclear weapons programs, and said that the government had not been complicit in the proliferation activities. The Pakistani official who made the announcement said that Khan had admitted to transferring technology and information to Iran between 1989 and 1991, to North Korea and Libya between 1991 and 1997 (U.S. officials at the time maintained that transfers had continued with Libya until 2003), and additional technology to North Korea up until 2000.<ref>David Rohde and David Sanger, "Key Pakistani is Said to Admit Atom Transfers", ''New York Times'', 2 February 2004: A1.</ref> On February 4, 2004, Khan appeared on national television and confessed to running a proliferation ring; he was pardoned the next day by Musharraf, the Pakistani president, but held under [[house arrest]].<ref name="Powell">Bill Powell and Tim McGirk, "The Man Who Sold the Bomb; How Pakistan's A.Q. Khan outwitted Western intelligence to build a global nuclear-smuggling ring that made the world a more dangerous place", ''Time Magazine'', 14 February 2005, p. 22.</ref>

=== Information coming from the investigation ===
The full scope of the Khan network is not fully known. Centrifuge components were apparently manufactured in [[Malaysia]] with the aid of South Asian and German middlemen, and used a [[Dubai]] computer company as a false front. According to Western sources, Khan had three motivations for his proliferation: 1. a defiance of Western nations and an eagerness to pierce the "clouds of so-called secrecy," 2. an eagerness to give nuclear technology to Muslim nations, and 3. money, acquiring wealth and real estate in his dealings. Much of the technology he sold was second-hand from Pakistan's own nuclear program and involved many of the same logistical connections which he had used to develop the Pakistani bomb.<ref name="Broad" /> In Malaysia, Khan was helped by [[Sri Lanka]]-born [[Buhary Sayed Abu Tahir]], who shuttled between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Dubai to arrange for the manufacture of centrifuge components.<ref name="Powell" /> The Khan investigation also revealed how many European companies were defying export restrictions and aiding the Khan network as well as the production of the Pakistani bomb. Dutch companies exported thousands of centrifuges to Pakistan as early as 1976, and a German company exported facilities for the production of [[tritium]] to the country.<ref>Craig S. Smith, "Roots of Pakistan Atomic Scandal Traced to Europe", ''New York Times'', 19 February 2004, page A3</ref> 

The investigation exposed [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[businessman]] [[Asher Karni]] as having sold nuclear devices to Khan's associates. Karni is currently awaiting trial in a U.S. prison.  Tahir was arrested in Malaysia in May 2004 under a Malaysian law allowing for the detention of individuals posing a security threat.<ref name="Powell" />

=== Pardon and U.S. reaction ===
On February 5, 2004, the day after Khan's televised confession, he was pardoned by Pakistani President Musharraf.  However, Khan remained under house arrest.

The United States government imposed no [[International sanctions|sanctions]] on the Pakistani government following the confession and pardon. U.S. government officials said that in the [[War on Terrorism]], it was not their goal to denounce or imprison people but "to get results." Sanctions on Pakistan or demands for an independent investigation of the Pakistani military might have led to restrictions on or the loss of use of Pakistan military bases needed by US and NATO troops in Afghanistan. "It's just another case where you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar," a U.S. government official explained.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The U.S. also refrained from applying further ''direct'' pressure on Pakistan to disclose more about Khan's activities due to a strategic calculation that such pressure might topple President Musharraf.

In a speech to the National Defense University on February 11, 2004, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] proposed to reform the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]: "No state, under investigation for proliferation violations, should be allowed to serve on the IAEA Board of Governors—or on the new special committee. And any state currently on the Board that comes under investigation should be suspended from the Board. The integrity and mission of the IAEA depends on this simple principle: Those actively breaking the rules should not be entrusted with enforcing the rules."<ref>The transcript of the speech is available online at [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/02/20040211-4.html "President Announces New Measures to Counter the Threat of WMD"], 
address by President George W. Bush at the National Defense University, February 11, 2004 </ref> The Bush proposal was seen as targeted against Pakistan which, currently, serves a regular term on the IAEA's Board of Governors. It has not received attention from other governments.

In western media, Khan became a major symbol of the threat of proliferation. In February 2005, he was featured on the cover of U.S.-based ''[[Time magazine]]'' as the "Merchant of Menace", labeled "the world's most dangerous nuclear trafficker," and in November 2005, the ''Atlantic Monthly'' ran a cover on Khan ("The Wrath of Khan") that featured a picture of a mushroom cloud behind Khan's head.

== Subsequent developments ==
=== Questioning ===
In September 2005, Musharraf revealed that after two years of questioning Khan — which the Pakistani government insisted to do itself without outside intervention — that they had confirmed that Khan had supplied centrifuge parts to North Korea. Still undetermined was whether or not Khan passed a bomb design to North Korea or Iran that had been discovered in Libya.<ref>David E. Sanger, "Pakistan Leader Confirms Nuclear Exports," ''New York Times'', 13 September 2005, p. A10</ref>

=== Renewed calls for IAEA access ===
Since 2005, and particularly in 2006, there have been renewed calls by [[IAEA]] officials, senior U.S. congressmen, EC politicians, and others to make Khan available for interrogation by IAEA investigators, given lingering skepticism about the "fullness" of the disclosures made by Pakistan regarding Khan's activities.  In the U.S., these calls have been made by elected U.S. lawmakers rather than by the U.S. Department of State, though some interpret them as signalling growing discontent within the U.S. establishment with the current Pakistani regime headed by Musharraf.

In May 2006, the [[U.S House of Representatives]] Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation held a hearing titled, "The A.Q. Khan Network: Case Closed?" Recommendations offered by legislators and experts at this hearing included demanding that Pakistan turn over Khan to the U.S. for questioning as well as that Pakistan make further efforts to curb future nuclear proliferation.  In June 2006, the Pakistani Senate, subcommittee hearing, issued a unanimous resolution criticizing the committee, stating that it will not turn over Khan to U.S. authorities and defending its sovereignty and nuclear program. 

=== Lack of further action ===
Neither Khan nor any of his alleged Pakistani collaborators have yet to face any charges in Pakistan, where he remains an extremely popular figure. Khan is still seen as an outspoken nationalist for his belief that the West is inherently hostile to Islam. In Pakistan's strongly anti-U.S. climate, tough action against him posed political risks for Musharraf, who faced accusations of being too pro-U.S. from key leaders in Pakistan's Army. An additional complicating factor is that few believe that Khan acted alone and the affair risks gravely damaging the Army, which oversaw and controlled the nuclear weapons development programme and of which Musharraf was commander-in-chief, until his resignation from military service on November 28, 2007.<ref>Ron Moreau and Zahid Hussain, "Chain of Command; The Military: Musharraf dodged a bullet, but could be heading for a showdown with his Army", ''Newsweek'', 16 February 2004, p. 20.</ref> In December 2006, the Swedish Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission (SWMDC) headed by [[Hans Blix]], a former chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency ([[IAEA]]) and United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission ([[UNMOVIC]]); said in a report that Khan could not have acted alone "without the awareness of the Pakistani Government".<ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec82006/foreign2156302006127.asp "A Q Khan did not act alone" says Hans Blix team]</ref>

It has also been speculated that Khan's two daughters, who live in the UK and are UK subjects (thanks to their part-British, part-South African mother Henny), are in possession of extensive documentation linking the government of Pakistan to Khan's activities; such documentation is presumably intended to ensure that no further action is taken against Khan.<ref>Shyam Bhatia,  [http://in.rediff.com/news/2004/feb/16pak1.htm "Khan's daughter leaves country with important documents"], February 16, 2004</ref> Conversely, both high-profile government members, such as [[Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq]], as well as political opposition parties have expressed their support for Khan, allegations of nuclear trafficking notwithstanding.

=== Cancer ===
On August 22, 2006, the Pakistani government announced that Khan had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and was undergoing treatment. On September 9, 2006, Khan was operated at Aga Khan hospital, in [[Karachi]]. According to doctors, the operation was successful, but on October 30 it was reported that his condition had deteriorated and he was suffering from [[deep vein thrombosis]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10408184 "Disgraced Pakistani scientist's health poor"], ''Reuters'', October 30, 2006</ref>

=== Release from house arrest ===
In February 2009, two senior government officials told the ''Associated Press'' that restrictions on Khan has been removed and he is considered as a free citizen, and that Khan could meet friends and relatives either at his home or elsewhere in Pakistan.  The officials said that a security detail continued to control his movements.<ref>http://www.dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/ihc-declares-drkhan-free-citizen--qs</ref>

=== Hospitalization ===
On March 5, 2008, Khan was admitted to an [[Islamabad]] hospital <ref>[http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-16/0803058063154324.htm "Pakistan nuclear scientist shifted to hospital on infection"], ''IRNA'', March 5, 2008</ref> with low [[blood pressure]] and fever <ref>[http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-16/0803094605183949.htm "Pakistan's top nuclear scientist discharged from hospital"], ''IRNA'', March 9, 2008</ref>, reportedly due to an infection.  He was released four days later after "he gained significant improvement".

===Pakistan army accused of proliferation===
On July 4, 2008 he in an interview blamed President Musharraf and Pakistan Army for the transfer of nuclear technology, he claimed that Musharraf was aware of all the deals and he was the "Big Boss" for those deals<ref name="dawn.com" />.

Khan said that Pakistan gave centrifuges to North Korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the army. The uranium enrichment equipment was sent from Pakistan in a North Korean plane loaded under the supervision of Pakistani security officials.  He also said that he had travelled to North Korea in 1999 with a Pakistani Army general to buy shoulder-launched missiles from the government there. Asked why he had taken sole responsibility for the nuclear proliferation, Khan said friends, including a central figure in the ruling party at the time, had persuaded him that it was in the national interest. In return he had been promised complete freedom.<ref name="KhanPointsNYT" />

In an article published on September 20, 2009 in the Sunday Times, the journalist Simon Henderson reveals of a letter written to him by Dr.Khan dated December 10, 2003, in which he alleges that he was acting precisely under the orders of the Pakistani government when he sold the designs of nuclear weapons to North Korea, Iran and Libya. He also alleges that Pakistan built a centrifuge plant for China in Hanzhong province.

=== Writing Columns ===
On November 12, 2008, he started writing weekly columns in [[The News International]] <ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/editorial_arc1.asp?wn=Dr%20A%20Q%20Khan]</ref> and [[Daily Jang]] <ref name="jang.net">[http://www.jang.net/editorial/details.asp?id=66]</ref><ref name="jang.net" />. His columns heavily emphasis on the [[education]] and [[engineering]] disciplines. He advocated for the importance of [[engineering]] disciplines and importance of education. Khan who was accused of selling sensitive [[nuclear technology]] to other countries of the world, has gained a significant respect through his columns among in [[Pakistanis]]. Khan expressed his views on the of [[Environmental policy|environmental]] issues. Dr. Khan is an avid supporter of [[Science and Technology]] [[education]] in Pakistan. Even though his columns heavily focused on the issues of education, Khan severely criticized [[Pervez Musharraf]] and his policies, in which he said because of his cruel domestic policies within Pakistan. The Taliban insurgency grew momentarily as well as instability in the country.

== Contribution to Metallurgical Education in Pakistan ==
Dr. A.Q Khan played an important role in the establishment of [[engineering]] universities in [[Pakistan]]. As both [[PAEC]] Chairman [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] established a [[nuclear physics]] and a [[nuclear engineering]] university, Pakistan Institute of Applied Sciences and Engineering. Abdul Qadeer Khan established a [[metallurgy]] and material science institute in [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology]], which is known as Dr. A. Q. Khan Department of Metallurgical Engineering and material sciences. He also served as its both executive member and director there. Dr. Khan played an important and key role in establishing a research institute Dr. A. Q. Khan Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering at [[Karachi University]]. Khan introduces [[metallurgical engineering]] courses in many newly-founded universities and sciences colleges in [[Pakistan]].

== Legacy ==
Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan is no longer associated with Pakistan's nuclear program. However, he is still widely seen as ''"Father of Pakistan's nuclear Program"'' even though he was only head of the [[centrifuge]]-based [[enrichment]] [[project]] at [[Kahuta]] and not the entire nuclear program, which was developed and run by [[PAEC]] Chairman, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]. Dr. Khan's involvement in [[nuclear proliferation]] has shocked the entire nation and he was criticized by his peers and fellow scientists such as Dr. [[Pervaiz Hoodbhoy]]. However, Khan's debriefing heavily effected ex-President Pervez Musharraf's popularity. It also increased Anti-American feelings among some Pakistanis. Many people in Pakistan blamed the United States for Khan's house-arrest. Many journalists and the mainstream media supported Khan and expressed their sympathies to him. Opposition parties in Pakistan as well as the government coalition parties rose their voices for Khan. This created a tough position for President Musharraf as well as United States. High-profile government members such as ex-religious affairs minister Mr. Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq held a [[public]] press conference on May 2007 and expressed his support for Khan, allegations of nuclear trafficking notwithstanding. A local Pakistani journalist, Ahmed Quraishi, wrote in his column:

''"We did not invent [[nuclear proliferation]]. Certainly Abdul Qadeer Khan gets no marks for originality in this area. What Khan did is wrong, but he was only walking in the footsteps of the pioneers of [[nuclear proliferation]] before him such as [[Klaus Fuchs]]. Also the British, German, Swiss and French [[expert]]s and [[companies]] that criss-crossed the globe in the 1970s and 80s trying to sell components for [[enrichment]] [[technology]], complete with secret catalogues marketing their products and services"''.<ref>http://www.ahmedquraishi.com/article_detail.php?id=111</ref> 

On August, 14,1989, Khan, along with [[PAEC]] Chairman [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], was awarded the high civilian award of "[[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]]" by former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In August 14, 1996, he was awarded the highest civilian award "[[Nishan-e-Imtiaz]]" by former Prime Minister of Pakistan [[Nawaz Sharif]]. In March 12, 1999, he was twice awarded the highest civilian award "[[Nishan-e-Imtiaz]]" from [[President of Pakistan]] [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]]. Khan is the only Pakistani citizen who has been twice awarded the [[Nishan-e-Imtiaz]]. Many [[Pakistani]] [[nuclear]] analysts and [[nuclear]] [[expert]]s have concluded that Khan is a clear example of a Russian scientist of the "Sputnik Space Program", and who took the entire credit of the nuclear program and neglected his fellow scientists and fellow engineers who have worked hard equally just like him.   

Khan has been awarded various honorary doctorates from many universities in Pakistan. In 1989, Khan was awarded the honorary degree of [[Doctorate of Science]] by the [[University of Karachi]]. In 1993, an honorary degree of [[Doctorate of Science]] by the [[Baqai Medical University]], [[Karachi]]. In 1998, a [[D.Sc]] from the  [[Hamdard University]] in [[Karachi]]. In 1999 he was awarded a [[D.Sc]] from [[Gomal University]]. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary degree of [[Doctorate of Science]] by the  [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]].[[Lahore]].

Despite his international image, Khan remains widely popular among in [[Pakistanis]] and he is considered domestically to be one of the most-influential and respected scientists in Pakistan. In an interview with Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]], a known political analyst, Dr. Salim Farookhi described Khan as, " the most influential and talented scientist that Pakistan has produced."<ref>http://www.friendskorner.com/forum/f39/successful-pakistanis-around-world-8830/</ref>
