==مخينه او شخصي ژوند==
The daughter of a former medical student who lost a foot while fighting the [[Soviet
The daughter of a former medical student who lost a foot while fighting the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], Malalai Joya was 4 years old when her family fled Afghanistan in 1982 to the refugee camps of Iran and later Pakistan. She finished her education in [[Pakistan]] and began teaching [[literacy]] courses to other women at the age of 19. After the Soviet withdrawal, Malalai Joya returned to [[Afghanistan]] in 1998 during the [[Taliban]]'s reign. During that time she established an orphanage and health clinic, and was soon a vocal opponent of the Taliban. 

Malalai Joya is also director of the non-governmental group, '''"Organisation of Promoting Afghan Women's Capabilities" (OPAWC)''' [http://www.geocities.com/opawc/] in the Western Afghanistan provinces of [[Herat]] and [[Farah]]. She is married.

==Controversial stance in the Loya Jirga==
Malalai Joya gained international attention in December 2003 when, as an elected delegate to the [[2003 loya jirga|Loya Jirga]] convened to ratify the [[Constitution of Afghanistan|Afghan Constitution]], she spoke out publicly against what she termed the domination of warlords.  In response, Sibghatullah Mujadidi, chief of the Loya Jirga called her "infidel" and "communist". Since then she has survived four assassination attempts, and travels in Afghanistan under a burqa and with armed guards. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3331751.stm]

World Pulse Magazine (Issue 1, 2005) wrote:

{{cquote|... When her time came to make her 3-minute statement, she tugged her black headscarf over her hair, stepped up to the microphone, and with emotional electricity made the speech that would alter her life. 

After she spoke, there was a moment of stunned silence. Then there was an uproar. Male mujahideen, some who literally had guns at their feet, rushed towards her, shouting. She was brought under the protection of UN security forces. 

In a nation where few dare to say the word "warlord" aloud, Joya had spoken fiercely against a proposal to appoint high clergy members and fundamentalist leaders to guide planning groups. She objected that several of those religious leaders were war criminals who should be tried for their actions—not national heroes to influence the new government. 

Despite the commands of Assembly Chairman, Joya refused to apologize.}}

Joya's controversial stance against other members of the Loya Jirga have earned her much popularity as well as heavy criticism from her political opponents.

==Political appointments and speaking engagements==
Joya was elected to the 249-seat National Assembly, or [[Wolesi Jirga]] in September 2005, as a representative of [[Farah Province]], winning the second highest number of votes in the province. [http://www.results.jemb.org/results.asp?ElectionID=1&ProvinceID=25&Order=Vote]

Although Joya receives numerous death threats and her home has been bombed, she has chosen to continue her stance against the inclusion of former [[mujahideen]] in the current Afghan government. in 2004, she and a delegation of 50 tribal elders persuaded President Karzai to dismiss a provincial governor who was a former Taliban commander.

The BBC has called Joya "the most famous woman in Afghanistan." In a January 27, 2007 interview with BBC News Joya commented on her personal political mission amid continuous death threats, saying:

"They will kill me but they will not kill my voice, because it will be the voice of all Afghan women. You can cut the flower, but you cannot stop the coming of spring." 
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4606174.stm]

In 2006, The [[Washington Post]] said of Joya: "Her truth is that warlords should not be permitted to hide behind "the mask of democracy to hold on to their chairs" and their pernicious pursuits at the expense of poor, "barefoot" Afghans who remain voiceless and disillusioned. The warlords are corrupt "war criminals" who should be tried, and incorrigible "drug dealers" who brought the country to its knees, she said." [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/16/AR2006031602102.html]

Malalai Joya appeared at the Federal Convention of Canada's [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) in Quebec City on September 10, 2006, supporting party leader [[Jack Layton]] and the NDP's criticism of the [[NATO]]-led mission in southern Afghanistan. She told "No nation can donate liberation to another nation."  [http://www.ndp.ca/page/4194]

On September 13 she addressed a gathering in McGill University in Montreal as well as the University of Ottawa, where she expressed her disappointment with American involvement in her home country, stating that, "Countries like the US have their own strategic policies in Afghanistan ... As long as they support the Northern Alliance with the mask of democracy, there will never be improvements in Afghanistan."  [http://dominionpaper.ca/foreign_policy/2006/09/20/canada_mus.html]
[http://www.arabamericannews.com/newsarticle.php?articleid=6338] [http://canadiandimension.com/articles/2006/09/15/660/]

Malalai was in [[Sydney, Australia]], on March 8, 2007, as a guest of [[UNIFEM]], speaking about women's rights in Afghanistan in honor of [[International Women's Day]].[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21336015-5001031,00.html]

==Parliament statements, attack, and ouster==
On May 7, 2006, Malalai Joya was physically and verbally attacked by fellow members of parliament after accusing several colleagues of being "warlords" and unfit for service in the new Afghan government.
"I said there are two kinds of mujahedeen in Afghanistan," Joya told the Associated Press. "One kind fought for independence, which I respect, but the other kind destroyed the country and killed 60,000 people." In response, angered lawmakers shouted death threats and threw empty plastic water bottles at Joya, who was shielded by sympathetic colleagues.[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0605090086may09,1,2440891.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed], [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002981276_afghan09.html],[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2171202,00.html], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050800550.html], [http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2006/05/09/afghan_legislator_attacked_for_views],[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-afghan-parliament-fight,1,6244716.story?coll=sns-ap-world-headlines], 

In response to such threats, Joya continues to speak out against those she believes to be former mujahedeen in Afghanistan, stating: 

{{cquote|"Never again will I whisper in the shadows of intimidation. I am but a symbol of my people's struggle and a servant to their cause. And if I were to be killed for what I believe in, then let my blood be the beacon for emancipation and my words a revolutionary paradigm for generations to come."}} [http://www.worldpulsemagazine.com/issues/1/the_woman_who_defies_warlords]

On May 21, 2007, fellow members of the Wolesi Jirga voted to suspend Malalai Joya for three years from the legislature, citing that she had broken Article 70 of the Parliament, which had banned Wolesi Jirga members from openly criticizing each other.  Joya had compared the Wolesi Jirga to a "stable or zoo" on a recent TV interview, and later called other members of parliament "criminals" and "drug smugglers." [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/4821465.html]

Joya said the vote was a "political conspiracy" and that she had been told Article 70 was written specifically for her saying "since I've started my struggle for human rights in Afghanistan, for women's rights, these criminals, these drug smugglers, they've stood against me from the first time I raised my voice at the Loya Jirga,"[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/21/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Lawmaker-Suspended.php]

In a statement, Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch wrote: "Malalai Joya is a staunch defender of human rights and a powerful voice for Afghan women, and she shouldn't have been suspended from parliament."  [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/05/23/afghan15995.htm]

People in Farah, Jalalabad, Takhar, Kabul and some other provinces of Afghanistan staged protests against suspension of Joya. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEZlnmYrFSw][http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20070530-085321-6823r][http://english.people.com.cn/200705/30/eng20070530_379384.html][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJoN3i__qXo]

On June 21, 2007, one month after Joya was suspended, an international day of action was observed by Joya supporters in Rome, New York, Barcelona, Milan, Alberta, Bologna, Viareggio, Vancouver, Melbourne and some other cities by staging protests to Afghan government to reinstate Joya to the parliament.

== Joya's 2-minute historical speech ==

Her speech in the Loya Jirga Meeting, Kabul, Afghanistan (December 17, 2003): 

{{cquote|My name is Malalai Joya from Farah Province. By the permission of the esteemed attendees, and by the name of God and the colored-shroud martyrs of the path of freedom, I would like to speak for a couple of minutes. 

My criticism on all my compatriots is that why are they allowing the legitimacy and legality of this Loya Jerga come under question with the presence of those felons who brought our country to this state. 

I feel pity and I feel very sorry that those who call Loya Jerga an infidel basis equivalent to blasphemy after coming here their words are accepted, or please see the committees and what people are whispering about. The chairman of every committee is already selected. Why do you not take all these criminals to one committee so that we see what they want for this nation. These were those who turned our country into the nucleus of national and international wars. They were the most anti-women people in the society who wanted to [makes pause] who brought our country to this state and they intend to do the same again. I believe that it is a mistake to test those already being tested. They should be taken to national and international court. If they are forgiven by our people, the bare-footed Afghan people, our history will never forgive them. They are all recorded in the history of our country.}}
