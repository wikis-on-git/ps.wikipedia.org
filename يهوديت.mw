'''Judaism''' is the [[religion]] of the [[Jew]]ish people, based on principles and ethics embodied in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) and the [[Talmud]]. According to Jewish tradition, the history of Judaism begins with the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] and [[Abraham]] (ca. 2000 BCE), the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] and progenitor of the Jewish people. Judaism is among the oldest religious traditions still in practice today. Jewish history and doctrines have influenced other religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. 

While Judaism has seldom, if ever, been [[Wiktionary:monolithic|monolithic]] in practice, it has always been [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] in [[theology]]. It differs from many religions in that central authority is not vested in a person or group, but in sacred texts and [[Halakha|traditions]]. Throughout the ages, Judaism has clung to a number of [[Jewish principles of faith|religious principles]], the most important of which is the belief in a single, [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[benevolence|benevolent]], [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Names of God in Judaism|God]], who [[Creation according to Genesis|created the universe]] and continues to govern it. According to traditional Jewish belief, the God who created the world established a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the [[Israelite]]s, and revealed his laws and [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of the [[Torah]], and the Jewish people are the descendants of the Israelites. The traditional practice of Judaism revolves around [[Torah study|study]] and the observance of God's laws and commandments as written in the Torah and expounded in the [[Talmud]]. 

With an estimated 14 million adherents in 2006,<ref>For an exploration of the Jewish population, please see [[Jewish population]] and [[Jews by country]].</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Judy|last=Jones|coauthors=William Wilson|title=An Incomplete Education|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=2006|edition=3rd edition|id=ISBN 978-0-7394-7582-9|pages=463|chapter=Religion}}</ref>

==Religious doctrine and ''Principles of Faith''==
{{main|Jewish principles of faith}}

Historically, Judaism has considered belief in the divine revelation and acceptance of the Written and Oral [[Torah]] as its fundamental core belief, but Judaism does not have a centralized authority dictating religious dogma. This gave rise to many different formulations as to the specific theological beliefs inherent in the Torah and [[Talmud]]. While some [[rabbi]]s have at times agreed upon a firm formulation, others have disagreed, many criticizing any such attempt as minimizing acceptance of the entire Torah.<ref>Rabbi S. of Montpelier, Yad Rama, Y. Alfacher, Rosh Amanah.</ref> Notably, in the Talmud some principles of faith (e.g., the Divine origin of the Torah) are considered important enough that rejection of them can put one in the category of "''apikoros''" ([[heresy|heretic]]).<ref>M. San 10:1.</ref>

Over the centuries, a number of clear formulations of Jewish principles of faith have appeared, and though they differ with respect to certain details, they demonstrate a commonality of core ideology. Of these, the one most widely considered authoritative is [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides.27 13 principles of faith|thirteen principles of faith]]. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]]. The thirteen principles were ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries. (Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought, Menachem Kellner). Over time two poetic restatements of these principles ("''[[Ani Ma'amin]]''" and "''[[Yigdal]]''") became canonized in the Jewish prayer book, and eventually became widely held. Today most Orthodox authorities hold that these beliefs are obligatory, and that Jews who do not fully accept each one of them are potentially heretical:

#I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His Name, is the Creator and Guide of everything that has been created; He alone has made, does make, and will make all things.
#I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His Name, is One, and that there is no unity in any manner like His, and that He alone is our God, who was, and is, and will be.
#I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His Name, is not a body, and that He is free from all the properties of matter, and that there can be no (physical) comparison to Him whatsoever.
#I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His Name, is the first and the last. 
#I believe with perfect faith that to the Creator, blessed be His Name, and to Him alone, it is right to pray, and that it is not right to pray to any being besides Him. 
#I believe with perfect faith that all the works of the prophets are true.
#I believe with perfect faith that the prophecy of Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, was true, and that he was the chief of the prophets, both of those who preceded him and of those who followed him.
#I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah that is now in our possession is the same that was given to Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him.
#I believe with perfect faith that this Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be any other Law from the Creator, blessed be His name.
#I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His name, knows all the deeds of human beings, and all their thoughts, as it is said: “[He] that fashioned the hearts of them all, [He] that comprehends all their actions.”
#I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His Name, rewards those that keep His commandments and punishes those that transgress them.
#I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah; and even though he may tarry, with all this I wait every day for his coming.
#I believe with perfect faith that there will be a revival of the dead at the time when it shall please the Creator, blessed be His name, and exalted be His Name forever and ever.

Some, such as Rabbi Joseph Albo and [[Abraham ben David|the Raavad]], criticized Maimonides' list as containing too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith, and thus placed too many Jews in the category of "heretic", rather than those who were simply in error. Many others criticized any such formulation as minimizing acceptance of the entire Torah (see above). As noted however, neither Maimonides nor his contemporaries viewed these principles as encompassing all of Jewish belief, but rather as the core theological underpinnings of the acceptance of Judaism. Along these lines, the ancient historian [[Josephus]] emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating [[apostasy]] with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included [[circumcision]] and adherence to traditional customs.

{{main|Halakha}}
The basis of Jewish law and tradition ("halakha") is the [[Torah]] (also known as the [[Pentateuch]] or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition there are [[613 mitzvot|613 commandments]] in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite|Leviyim]] (members of the tribe of [[Levi]]), some only to farmers within the land of [[Israel]]. Many laws were only applicable when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] existed, and fewer than 300 of these commandments are still applicable today.

While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were claimed to be based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the [[Sadducees]], and the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]), most Jews believed in what they call the [[oral law]]. These oral traditions were transmitted by the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] sect of ancient Judaism, and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.

Rabbinic Judaism has always held that the books of the Torah (called the written law) have always been transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition. To justify this viewpoint, Jews point to the text of the Torah, where many words are left undefined, and many procedures mentioned without explanation or instructions; this, they argue, means that the reader is assumed to be familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources. This parallel set of material was originally transmitted orally, and came to be known as "the [[oral law]]".

By the time of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] (200 CE), after the destruction of Jerusalem, much of this material was edited together into the [[Mishnah]]. Over the next four centuries this law underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonia]]), and the commentaries on the Mishnah from each of these communities eventually came to be edited together into compilations known as the two [[Talmud]]s. These have been expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.

Halakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition - the Mishnah, the halakhic [[Midrash]], the Talmud and its commentaries. The Halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as [[responsa]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Sheelot U-Teshuvot''.) Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.

===يهودي فلسفه===
{{main|Jewish philosophy}}

Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]]. Major changes occurred in response to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (late 1700s to early 1800s) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], and [[Yitzchok Hutner]]. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include [[Martin Buber]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], and [[Emmanuel Lévinas]].

===Distinction between Jews and Judaism===
According to Daniel Boyarin, the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in [[Plato|Platonic philosophy]] and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism.<ref>{{cite book

 | quote = <small>Paul was motivated by a Hellenistic desire for the One, which among other things produced an ideal of a universal human essence, beyond difference and hierarchy. This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body — as did, for instance, the gnostics — but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity.</small>
}}</ref>  Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that most of Judaism's 4,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West. During this time, Jews have experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile; in the Diasporas, they have been in contact with and have been influenced by ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see [[Haskalah]]) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in the Levant. They also saw an elite convert to Judaism (the [[Khazar]]s), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols. Thus, Boyarin has argued that "Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension."<ref>{{cite book

{{main|Who is a Jew?}}

According to traditional Jewish Law, a Jew is anyone born of a Jewish mother or [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in accord with Jewish Law. American [[Reform Judaism]] and British [[Liberal Judaism]] accept the child of one Jewish parent (father or mother) as Jewish if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity. All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his sincerity and knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html |title=Who is a Jew? |accessdate=2007-10-06 |last=Weiner |first=Rebecca |coauthors= |date=2007 |work= |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] }}</ref>

Traditional Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. Thus, one's Jewishness is a technical measure, made in accordance with a standard definition. However, the Reform movement maintains that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew,<ref>http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/10-Reform/section-15.html ''Reform's Position On...What is unacceptable practice?''</ref><ref>Heschel, Susannah (1998) Abraham Geiger and the Jewish Jesus. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 157.

The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, [[David Ben-Gurion]] requested opinions on ''mihu Yehudi'' ("who is a Jew") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is far from settled, and occasionally resurfaces in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].

===Jewish demographics===
{{main|Jewish population}}

The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of "who is a Jew" is problematic as not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the ''Jewish Year Book'' (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3 million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million. Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001. Intermarriage and the declining birthrate are taking their toll on Jewish population figures, although conversion to Judaism may help to offset this slightly.

==Jewish denominations==
{{main|Jewish denominations}}
In the late [[Middle Ages]], when [[Europe]] and western [[Asia]] were divided into [[Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic countries, the [[Jew]]ish people also found themselves divided into two main groups. Jews in [[central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], namely in [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], were called [[Ashkenazi]]. [[Sephardic Jews]] can trace their tradition back to the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] countries, particularly [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] under Muslim rule. When they were expelled in 1492, they settled in [[North Africa]], the eastern Mediterranean, the [[Far East]], and [[northern Europe]]. The two traditions differ in a number of ritual and cultural ways, but their theology and basic Jewish practice are the same.

Over the past two centuries the Ashkenazi Jewish community has divided into a number of [[Jewish denominations]]; each has a different understanding of what principles of belief a Jew should hold, and how one should live as a Jew. To some degree, these doctrinal differences have created [[schisms among the Jews|schisms between the Jewish denominations]]. Nonetheless, there is some level of Jewish unity. For example, it would not be unusual for a Conservative Jew to attend either an Orthodox or Reform synagogue. The article on [[Relationships between Jewish religious movements]] discusses how different Jewish denominations view each other. Many non-Ashkenazi Jews, especially in the United States, are members of congregations affiliated with the various movements, although they may not specifically identify themselves as members of that denomination. They frequently do so out of convenience, and are likely to describe their religious practice as "traditional" or "observant", as opposed to "Orthodox" or "Conservative".

*[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that both the Written and [[Oral Torah]] were divinely revealed to [[Moses]], and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the ''[[Shulchan Arukh|Shulchan Aruch]]'' (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions) such as the [[Moses Isserlis]]'s ''HaMapah'' and the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', to be the definitive codification of Jewish law, and assert a continuity between the Judaism of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], pre-Enlightenment Rabbinic Judaism, and modern-day Orthodox Judaism. Most of Orthodox Judaism holds to one particular form of Jewish theology, based on [[Maimonides#The 13 principles of faith|Maimonides' 13 principles of Jewish faith]]. Orthodox Judaism broadly (and informally) shades into two main styles, Modern Orthodox Judaism and Haredi Judaism. The philosophical distinction is generally around accommodation to modernity and weight placed on non-Jewish disciplines, though in practical terms the differences are often reflected in styles of dress and rigor in practice. According to most Orthodox Jews, Jewish people who do not keep the laws of [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Yom Tov]] (the holidays), [[kashrut]], and [[niddah|family purity]] are considered non-religious. Any Jew who keeps at least those laws would be considered observant and religious. [[Image:Hasidim.jpg||230px|thumb|right|[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] wearing black frock coats and fur shtreimels]]
**[[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] emphasizes strict observance of religious laws and commandments but with a broad, liberal approach to modernity and living in a non-Jewish or secular environment. Modern Orthodox women are gradually assuming a greater role in Jewish ritual practice, which is not acceptable in the Haredi community. 
**[[Haredi Judaism]] (also known as "ultra-Orthodox Judaism," although some find this term offensive) is a very conservative form of Judaism. The Haredi world revolves around study, prayer and meticulous religious observance. Some Haredi Jews are more open to the modern world, perhaps most notably the [[Chabad|Lubavitch]] Hasidim, but their acceptance of modernity is more a tool for enhancing Jewish faith than an end in itself. 
***[[Hasidic Judaism]] is a stream of Haredi Judaism based on the teachings of Rabbi [[Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)]]. [[Hasidic philosophy]] is rooted in the [[Kabbalah]], and Hasidic Jews accept the Kabbalah as sacred scripture. They are distinguished both by a variety of special customs and practices including reliance on a [[Rebbe]] or supreme religious leader, and a special dress code particular to each Hasidic group. 

*[[Conservative Judaism]], known as [[Masorti]] Judaism outside of the United States and Canada, developed in Europe and the United States in the 1800s as Jews reacted to the changes brought about by the Enlightenment and Jewish emancipation. It is characterized by a commitment to following traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of [[Shabbat]] and [[kashrut]], a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic modes of study along with modern scholarship and critical text study when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses. Similarly, Conservative Judaism holds that Judaism's [[oral Torah|Oral Law]] is divine and normative, but rejects some Orthodox interpretations of the Oral Law. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions, although great caution should be exercised in doing so. 

*[[Reform Judaism]], called [[Liberal Judaism|Liberal]] or [[Progressive Judaism|Progressive]] in many countries, originally formed in [[Germany]] in response to the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. (Note that in the United Kingdom, there are two distinct congregational unions, Reform and Liberal. The former is significantly more traditional than the latter, but both hold to similar theoretical positions.) Its defining characteristic with respect to the other movements is its rejection of the binding nature of Jewish ceremonial law as such and belief instead that individual Jews should exercise an informed autonomy about what to observe. Reform Judaism initially defined Judaism as a religion, rather than as a race or culture, rejected most of the ritual ceremonial laws of the [[Torah]] while observing moral laws, and emphasized the ethical call of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. Reform Judaism developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in many cases) and emphasized personal connection to Jewish tradition over specific forms of observance. Today, many Reform congregations encourage the study of Hebrew and traditional observances, while a smaller number continue to espouse the liberal ethos of the classical reformers of the nineteenth century.
[[Image:ReformJewishService.jpg||230px|thumb|right|A Reform synagogue with mixed seating and equal participation of men and women]]

*[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] started as a stream of philosophy by [[Mordechai Kaplan]], a Conservative rabbi, and later became an independent movement emphasizing reinterpreting Judaism for modern times. Like Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.

*[[Jewish Renewal]], a recent North American movement, was begun by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], a Hassidic rabbi, in the 1960s. Jewish Renewal focuses on spirtuality and social justice, but does not address issues of Jewish law. Men and women participate equally in prayer.

*[[Humanistic Judaism]]. A small nontheistic movement that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity. Founded by Rabbi [[Sherwin Wine]], it is centered in North America and Israel but also has affiliated groups in Europe and Latin America. 

===Jewish denominations in Israel===
{{main|Religion in Israel}}
Even though all of these denominations exist in Israel, Israelis tend to classify Jewish identity in ways that are different than [[diaspora]] Jewry. Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as "secular" (''hiloni''), "traditional" (''masorti''), "religious" (''dati'') or ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]''. The term "secular" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).

The term "traditional" (''masorti'') is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of "eastern" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the official [[Masorti]] (Conservative) movement.

There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways "secular" and "traditional" are used in Israel. They often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of ideology and religious observance.

The term "Orthodox" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category in Israel is far greater than in the diaspora. Various methods of measuring this percentage, each with its pros and cons, are the proportion of religiously observant [[Knesset]] members, the proportion of Jewish children enrolled in religious schools, and statistical studies on "identity."

What would be called "Orthodox" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called ''dati'' (religious) or ''haredi'' (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called "Religious Zionism" or the "National Religious" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as ''haredi-leumi'' ([[nationalism|nationalist]] ''haredi''), or "Hardal," which combines a largely ''haredi'' lifestyle with nationalist ideology.

''Haredi'' applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) "Lithuanian" (non-hasidic) ''haredim'' of Ashkenazic origin; (2) Hasidic ''haredim'' of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) Sephardic ''haredim''. The third group is the largest, and has been the most politically active since the early 1990s.

===Alternative Judaism===
[[Alternative Judaism|Other expressions of Jewish identity]] fall outside of this conservative-liberal continuum.

Unlike the above denominations, which were ideological reactions that resulted from the exposure of traditional rabbinic Judaism to the radical changes of modern times, [[Karaite Judaism]] did not begin as a modern Jewish movement. The followers of Karaism believe they are the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the [[Second Temple]] period, such as the [[Sadducees]], though others contend they are a sect started in the 8th and 9th centuries. The Karaites (or "Scripturalists") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat: "Plain or Simple Meaning"; and do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community, while most do. It is interesting to note that the Nazis often did not associate Karaites with Jews, and therefore several Karaite communities were spared in WWII and exist to this day even in places such as [[Lithuania]] where Jewish communities were completely devastated. In other areas, such as [[Greece]], the Nazis deemed Karaites as belonging to a greater Jewish tradition and abused them accordingly.

Another historical division among ethnic Jews are the [[Samaritan]]s, who maintain a distinct cultural and religious identity from mainstream Judaism, and are located entirely around [[Mount Gerizim]] in the [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]] region of the [[West Bank]] and in [[Holon]], near [[Tel Aviv]] in Israel.

==Jewish observances==
===Religious clothing===
A ''[[kippah]]'' (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural ''kippot''; [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: יאַרמלקע, ''yarmulke'') is a slightly-rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jewish men while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. Some Jewish women have also begun to wear kippot. ''Kippot'' range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head, to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.   

''[[Tzitzit]]'' (Hebrew: צִיציִת) ([[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi pronunciation]]: ''tzitzis'') are special knotted "fringes" or "tassels" found on the four corners of the ''[[tallit]]'' (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: ''tallis''), or prayer [[shawl]]. The ''tallit'' is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A  ''tallit katan'' (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.  

[[Tefillin]] (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word "phylakterion," meaning fortress or protection), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.<ref>"Tefillin," "The Book of Jewish Knowledge," Nathan Ausubel, Crown Publishers, NY, 1964, p.458)</ref>

A ''[[kittel]]'' (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leades and some observant traditional Jews on the [[High Holidays]]. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a ''tallit'' and ''kittel'' which are part of the ''tachrichim'' (burial garments).

Traditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, with a fourth prayer added on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|holidays]]. At the heart of each service is the ''[[Amidah]]'' or ''Shemoneh Esrei''. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' (or ''Shema''). The ''Shema'' is the recitation of a verse from the Torah ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4): ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad'' — "Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!"

Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be said in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a [[quorum]] of ten adult Jews, called a ''[[minyan]]''. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a ''minyan''; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.

In addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Everyday prayers and blessings|performing various acts]]. Prayers are recited upon [[Modeh ani|waking up in the morning]], before eating or drinking different foods, [[Birkat Hamazon|after eating a meal]], and so on.

The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an [[Egalitarianism|equal basis]] with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as [[Torah reading|reading from the Torah]]. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.

Jewish holy days celebrate central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as [[Creation (theology)|creation]], [[revelation]], and [[salvation|redemption]]. 

====Shabbat====
{{main|Shabbat}}

''[[Shabbat]]'', the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to shortly after sundown Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation.<ref name = "shabbat">{{

}}</ref> It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have [[challah]], two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of ''melakhah'',]] translated literally as "work." In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not "work" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel, and using electricity.

====Three pilgrimage festivals====
{{main|Shalosh regalim}}

Jewish holidays (''haggim''), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called "regalim" (derived from the Hebrew word "regel," or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.

*[[Passover]] (''Pesach'') is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the [[Exodus]] from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the [[Passover Seder|Seder]]. [[leavening agent|Leavened]] products ([[chametz]]) are removed from the house prior to the holiday, and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to insure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. [[Matzo]] is eaten instead of bread. 

*[[Shavuot]] ("Pentecost" or "Feast of Weeks") celebrates the revelation of the [[Torah]] to the [[Israelite]]s on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity. 

*[[Sukkot]] ("Tabernacles" or "The Festival of Booths") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called ''sukkot'' (sing. ''[[sukkah]]'') that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest, and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in ''sukkot'' for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with [[Shemini Atzeret]], where Jews begin to pray for rain and [[Simchat Torah]], "Rejoicing of the Torah," a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls.

====High Holy Days====
{{main|High Holidays}}

The High Holidays (''Yamim Noraim'' or "Days of Awe") revolve around judgment and forgiveness.

*[[Rosh Hashanah]],  (also ''Yom Ha-Zikkaron'' or "Day of Remembrance," and ''Yom Teruah'', or "Day of the Sounding of the [[Shofar]]"). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, "head of the year"), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Tishri]]. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates. 

*[[Yom Kippur]], ("Day of Atonement") is the most solemn day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a "Mahzor." Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the "seuda mafseket," is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called "Ne'ilah," ends with a long blast of the shofar.

====Other holidays====
<big>'''[[Hanukkah]]'''</big>

'''Hanukkah''', חנוכה, also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] ([[Hebrew calendar]]). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.

The holiday was called Hanukkah meaning "dedication" because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the "Miracle of the Oil". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] following the victory of the [[Maccabees]] over the [[Seleucid Empire]], there was only enough consecrated [[oil]] to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days - which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.

Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.  

<big>'''[[Purim]]'''</big>

'''Purim''' (Hebrew: פורים Pûrîm English: "Lots") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the [[Persian Jews]] from the plot of the evil [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], who sought to [[genocide|exterminate]] them, as recorded in the biblical [[Book of Esther]]. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, [[Alms|charity]] to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called [[hamantash]]en, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.    

Purim is celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]], which comes out in February-March.

===Torah readings===
{{main|Torah reading}}
The core of festival and [[Shabbat]] prayer services is the public reading of the [[Torah]], along with connected readings from the other books of the [[Tanakh]], called [[Haftarah]]. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on [[Simchat Torah]].

===Synagogues and Religious Buildings===
{{main|Synagogue}}
[[Image:SPAmster.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Interior of the [[Amsterdam Esnoga|Esnoga synagogue in Amsterdam]]]]

Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study, they usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are: 
*The [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] (called ''aron ha-kodesh'' by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] and ''hekhal'' by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) where the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (''[[parochet]]'') outside or inside the ark doors); 
*The elevated reader's platform (called ''[[bimah]]'' by Ashkenazim and ''tebah'' by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues); 
*The [[sanctuary lamp|eternal light]] (''ner tamid''), a continually-lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit [[menorah]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] 
*The pulpit, or ''amud'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a lecturn facing the Ark where the [[hazzan]] or prayer leader stands while praying. 

In addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include [[yeshiva]]s, or institutions of Jewish learning, and [[mikvah]]s, which are ritual baths.

===Dietary laws: ''Kashrut''===
{{main|Kashrut}}

The laws of [[kashrut]] ("keeping kosher") are the Jewish dietary laws. Food in accord with Jewish law is termed [[kosher foods|kosher]], and food not in accord with Jewish law is termed ''treifah'' or ''treif''. The Torah cites no reason for the laws of kashrut, but the rabbis have offered various explanations, including ritual purity, teaching people to control their urges, and health benefits. Kashrut involves the abstention from consuming birds and beasts that prey on other animals, and creatures that roam the sea floor eating the excretions of other animals. Major prohibitions exist on eating pork, which is considered an unclean animal, and seafood. Meat is ritually slaughtered, and meat and milk are not eaten together, based on the biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk. 

Although hygiene may have been a factor, the deeper purpose of kashrut is to lend a spiritual dimension to the physical act of eating. The idea is that Jews should not put anything into their mouths that involves spiritual "negatives" such as pain, sickness, uncleanliness, or cruelty to animals.

===Family purity===
{{main|Niddah}}

The laws of ''[[niddah]]'' ("menstruant", often referred to euphemistically as "family purity") and various other laws regulating the interaction between men and women (e.g., ''[[tzniut]]'', modesty in dress) are perceived, especially by Orthodox Jews, as vital factors in Jewish life, though they are rarely followed by Reform or Conservative Jews. The laws of ''niddah'' dictate that [[sexual intercourse]] cannot take place while the woman is having a [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual]] flow, and she has to count seven "clean" days and immerse in a ''[[mikvah]]'' (ritual bath) following menstruation.

===Life-cycle events===
Life-cycle events, or [[rites of passage]], occur throughout a Jew's life that serve to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community. 

*[[Brit milah]] - Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of [[circumcision]] on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named ''[[zeved habat]]'', enjoys limited popularity.
*[[Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah|Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah]] - This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a "portion" of the Torah. 
*[[Jewish views of marriage|Marriage]] - Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event. A wedding takes place under a ''[[chupah]]'', or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people.
*[[bereavement in Judaism|Death and Mourning]] - Judaism has a multi-staged [[mourning]] practice. The first stage is called the [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] (literally "seven", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the ''shloshim'' (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, ''avelut yud bet chodesh'', which is observed for eleven months.

==Community leadership==
===Classical priesthood===
The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future [[Third Temple]] and need to remain in readiness for future duty. 
*[[Kohen]] (priest) - patrilineal descendant of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. In the Temple, the ''kohanim'' were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the [[Priestly Blessing]], as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.
*Levi ([[Levite]]) - Patrilineal descendant of [[Levi]] the son of [[Jacob]]. In the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the levites sang [[Psalms]], performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.

===Prayer leaders===
From the time of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities &mdash; reading the [[Torah]] and ''haftarah'' (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals &mdash; require a ''minyan'', the presence of ten adults (Orthodox Jews and some Conservative Jews require ten adult men; some Conservative Jews and Reform Jews include women in the minyan).

The most common professional clergy in a [[synagogue]] are:
*[[Rabbi]] of a congregation - Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e. from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as ''shatz'' or ''baal kriyah'' (see below).
**Hassidic ''[[Rebbe]]'' - rabbi who is the head of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] dynasty.
*[[Hazzan]] (note: the "h" denotes [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]) (cantor) - a trained vocalist who acts as ''shatz''. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.

Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi and/or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:
*Shaliach tzibur or ''Shatz'' (leader &mdash; literally "agent" or "representative" &mdash; of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer, and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a ''shatz'' recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is ''not'' acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying ''amen'' at their conclusion; it is with this act that the ''shatz's'' prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as ''shatz''. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but the Conservative and Reform movements now allow women to serve in this function. 
*The [[Baal kriyah]] or ''baal koreh'' (master of the reading) reads the weekly [[Torah]] portion. The requirements for being the ''baal kriyah'' are the same as those for the ''shatz''. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role, and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.

Many congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:
*[[Gabbai]] (sexton) - Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the ''shatz'' for each prayer session if there is no standard ''shatz'', and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.

The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as ''shatz'' and ''baal kriyah'', and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.

===Specialized religious roles===
*''[[Beth din#Officers of a Beth Din|Dayan]]'' (judge) - An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a ''[[beth din]]'' (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community. 
*[[Mohel]] - Ritual circumciser who performs the ''[[brit milah]]'' (circumcision). An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a qualified ''mohel''.
*[[shechita|Shochet]] (ritual slaughterer) - In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a ''shochet'' who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another ''shochet.''
*[[Sofer (scribe)|Sofer]] (scribe) - [[Torah]] scrolls, ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), ''[[mezuzah|mezuzot]]'' (scrolls put on doorposts), and ''gittin'' (bills of divorce) must be written by a ''sofer'' who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.
*[[Rosh yeshiva]] -  A Torah scholar who runs a [[yeshiva]].
*[[Mashgiach ruchani|Mashgiach]] of a yeshiva - Supervises the emotional and spiritual welfare of students in a ''yeshiva'', and gives lectures on ''mussar'' (Jewish ethics).
*[[Mashgiach]] - Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of [[kashrut]] and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself.

====دوديزه اندونه====
[[Image:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|thumb|300px|left|Scenes from the [[Book of Esther]] decorate the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] dating from 244 CE]]
At its core, the Bible is an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with [[God]] from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 350 BCE). This relationship is often a contentious one, as the Israelites struggle with their faith in God and attraction to other gods. Among the larger-than-life figures we meet in the Bible are the Patriarchs — [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], who wrestled with their beliefs —- and [[Moses]], who led the Israelites out of Egypt. 

[[Abraham]], hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the Jewish people, rejected the [[idolatry]] that he saw around him and embraced [[monotheism]]. As a reward for this act of faith in one God, he was promised many offspring: "Look now toward heaven and count the stars/So shall be your progeny." ([[Genesis]] 15:5) Abraham's first child was [[Ishmael]] and his second son was [[Isaac]], whom God said would continue Abraham's work and inherit the [[Land of Israel]] (then called [[Canaan]]), after having been exiled and redeemed. God sent the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] [[Jacob]] and his children to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], where after many generations they became enslaved. God later commanded [[Moses]] to redeem the Israelites from slavery, leading to [[the Exodus]] from Egypt. The Israelites gathered at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in 1313 BCE (Jewish Year 2448) and received the  [[Torah]] - the five books of Moses: [[Genesis]], [[Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]]. These books, together with [[Nevi'im]] and [[Ketuvim]] are known as ''Torah Shebikhtav'': literally the "Written Torah," as opposed to the [[Oral Torah]], which refers to the Mishna and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the [[land of Israel]].

God designated the descendants of [[Aaron]], Moses' brother, to be a [[Kohen|priestly class]] within the Israelite community. They first officiated in the [[tabernacle (Judaism)|tabernacle]] (a portable house of worship), and later their descendants were in charge of worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

Once the Israelites had settled in the land of Israel, the tabernacle was planted in the city of [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]] for over 300 years during which time God provided great men, and occasionally women, to rally the nation against attacking enemies, some of which were sent by God as a punishment for the sins of the people. This is described in the [[Book of Joshua]] and the [[Book of Judges]]. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the [[Philistines]] to capture the tabernacle in Shiloh.

The people of Israel then told [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] the [[prophet]] that they had reached the point where they needed to be governed by a permanent king, as were other nations, as described in the [[Books of Samuel]]. Samuel grudgingly acceded to this request and appointed [[Saul the King|Saul]], a great but very humble man, to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint [[David]] in his stead.

Once King David was established, he told the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] that he would like to build a permanent temple, and as a reward for his actions, God promised David that he would allow his son to build the temple and the throne would never depart from his children (David himself was not allowed to build the temple because he had been involved in many wars, making it inappropriate for him to build a temple representing peace). As a result, it was David's son [[Solomon]] who built the [[Solomon's Temple|first permanent temple]] according to God's will, in [[Jerusalem]], as described in the [[Books of Kings]]. 
[[Image:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] is a remnant of the wall encircling the [[Second Temple]]. The [[Temple Mount]] is the holiest site in Judaism.]] 

Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the ''[[Oral Torah]]'' or ''[[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]'', were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by [[Rabbi]] [[Judah haNasi]] (Judah the Prince) in the [[Mishnah]], redacted ''circa'' 200 CE. The [[Talmud]] was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the [[Gemara]], rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, [[Palestine]] and Babylonia. Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. It was compiled sometime during the fourth century in Israel. The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars [[Ravina I]], [[Ravina II]], and [[Rav Ashi]] by 500 C.E., although it continued to be edited later.

====Critical historical view====
Critical scholars (who may or may not be observant Jews), reject the claim that sacred texts, including the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] were either dictated by God or divinely inspired. Instead, they see these texts as authored by humans and meaningful in specific historical and cultural contexts. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the [[Documentary hypothesis]] and suggest that the [[Torah]] consists of a variety of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts.<ref>Yehezkal Kauffman, ''The Religion of Israel''</ref><ref>Robert Alter ''The Art of Biblical Poetry''</ref><ref>.A. Speiser ''Genesis'' (The Anchor Bible)</ref>
[[Image:Torah and jad.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A [[Torah]] scroll.]]

These scholars have various theories concerning the origins of the Israelites and Israelite religion. Most agree that the people who formed the nation of Israel during the First Temple era had origins in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, although some question whether any or all of their ancestors had been slaves in Egypt. Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel were [[henotheism|henotheists]], that is, they believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods.<ref>John Bright ''A History of Israel''</ref><ref>Martin Noth ''The History of Israel''</ref> Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism.<ref>Ephraim Urbach ''The Sages''</ref>  

In this view, it was only by the [[Hellenic period]] that most Jews came to believe that their God was the only God (and thus, the God of everyone), and that the record of His revelation (the Torah) contained within it universal truths. This attitude reflected a growing [[Gentile]] interest in Judaism (some Greeks and Romans considered the Jews a most "philosophical" people because of their belief in a God that cannot be represented visually), and growing Jewish interest in [[Greek philosophy]], which sought to establish universal truths, thus leading - potentially - to the idea of monotheism, at least in the sense that "all gods are One."  It was also at this time that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.<ref>Shaye Cohen ''The beginnings of Jewishness</ref> According to one scholar, the clash between the early Christians and Pharisees that ultimately led to the birth of the Christian religion and Rabbinic Judaism reflected the struggle by Jews to reconcile their claims to national particularism and theological universalism.<ref>Daniel Boyarin ''A Radical Jew''</ref>

===Antiquity===
{{see|Canaanite religion}}

The [[United Monarchy]] was established under [[Saul the King|Saul]] and continued under [[King David]] and [[Solomon]] with its capital in [[Jerusalem]]. After Solomon's reign the nation split into two kingdoms, the [[Kingdom of Israel]] (in the north) and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (in the south). The [[Kingdom of Israel]] was conquered by the [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the [[Habor]] valley. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the [[First Temple]] that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judean elite were exiled to [[Babylonia]] and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. During this captivity the Jews in Babylon wrote what is known as the "Babylonian Talmud" while the remaining Jews in Judea wrote what is called the "Palestinian Talmud". These are the first written forms of the Torah and the Babylonian Talmud is the Talmud used to this day. Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] seventy years later, a period known as the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. A new [[Second Temple]] was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed. 

During the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed. 
[[Hellenistic Judaism]] spreads to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BC, and becomes a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' throughout the [[Roman Empire]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].

After a Jewish revolt against Roman rule in 66 CE, the Romans all but destroyed [[Jerusalem]]. Following a second revolt, Jews were not allowed to enter the city of Jerusalem and most Jewish worship was forbidden by Rome. Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see [[Jewish diaspora]]).

===Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)===
Around the [[1st century|first century CE]] there were several small Jewish sects: the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Zealots]], [[Essenes]], and [[early Christianity|Christians]]. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished. [[Christianity]] survived, but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion; the [[Pharisees]] survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism (today, known simply as "Judaism"). The [[Sadducees]] rejected the [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] and the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], relying only on the [[Torah]] as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. 

Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the [[oral law|Oral Law]] as recorded in the [[Mishnah]] (and developed by later rabbis in the two [[Talmud]]s), relying instead only upon the [[Tanakh]]. These included the [[Isunians]], the [[Yudganites]], the [[Malikites]], and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the [[Karaism|Karaite]] sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.

Over time Jews developed into distinct ethnic groups — amongst others, the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]), the [[Sephardi Jews]] (of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[North Africa]]), the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]] and the [[Yemenite Jews]], from the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. This split is cultural, and is not based on any doctrinal dispute, although the distance did result in minor differences in practice and prayers.

===Persecutions===
{{main|Persecution of Jews|Antisemitism|History of antisemitism}}
Antisemitism arose during the [[Middle Ages]], in the form of persecutions, [[pogrom]]s, [[forced conversion]], expulsions, social restrictions and [[ghetto]]ization.

This was different in quality to any repressions of Jews in ancient times. Ancient repression was politically motivated and Jews were treated no differently than any other ethnic group would have been. With the rise of the Churches, attacks on Jews became motivated instead by theological considerations specifically deriving from Christian views about Jews and Judaism {{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

===Hasidism===
{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}

Hasidic Judaism was founded by [[Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)|Yisroel ben Eliezer]] (1700-1760), also known as the ''Ba'al Shem Tov'' (or ''Besht''). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people, when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too "academic", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. His disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across [[Europe]]. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the [[United States]]. 

Early on, there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as [[Mitnagdim]], (lit. "opponents"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship, its untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle-working to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Since then differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of [[Haredi Judaism]].

===The Enlightenment and [[Reform Judaism]]===
{{main|Haskalah|Reform Judaism}}

In the late 18th century CE, [[Europe]] was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, [[Haskalah]] or the "Jewish Enlightenment," began, especially in [[Central Europe]], in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge such as reason. The thrust and counter-thrust between supporters of Haskalah and more traditional Jewish concepts eventually led to the formation of a number of different branches of Judaism: Haskalah supporters founded Reform Judaism and [[Liberal Judaism]], while traditionalists founded what is called [[Orthodox Judaism]], and Jews seeking a balance between the two sides founded [[Masorti]] and [[Conservative Judaism]]. A number of smaller groups came into being as well.

===The Holocaust===
{{main|The Holocaust}}

The Holocaust was the genocide of millions of Jews under [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]<ref name=Niewyk1>Niewyk, Donald L. ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust,'' [[Columbia University Press]], 2000, p.45: "The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans in World War II." Also see "The Holocaust," ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 2007: "the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women and children, and millions of others, by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators during World War II. The Germans called this "the final solution to the Jewish question."</ref> The state-led systematic [[persecution]] and [[genocide]] of the Jews (and other [[minority group]]s) of Europe and [[History of North Africa#European colonization|European Colonial North Africa]] during [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and its [[Non-German cooperation with nazis during World War 2|collaborators]]<ref>Donald L Niewyk, ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust,'' [[Columbia University Press]], 2000, p.45: "The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans in World War II."  However, the Holocaust usually includes all of the different victims who were systematically murdered.</ref> The persecution and [[genocide]] were accomplished in stages. [[Nuremberg Laws|Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society]] was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II. [[Nazi concentration camps|Concentration camp]]s were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] conquered new territory in eastern Europe, specialized units called [[Einsatzgruppen]] murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6724481.stm Ukrainian mass Jewish grave found]</ref> Jews and Roma were crammed into [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939 - 1944|ghettos]] before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to [[extermination camp]]s where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers. Every arm of [[Germany]]'s bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder, turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called "a genocidal nation."<ref name=Berenbaum103>Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know," United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103.</ref>

===Judaism today===
In most industrialized nations with modern economies, such as the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]], a wide variety of Jewish practices exist, along with a growing plurality of [[secular Jewish culture|secular]] and non-practicing Jews. For example, in the world's second largest Jewish community, that of the United States, according to the [http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=83784 2001 edition] of the [[National Jewish Population Survey]], 4.3 million out of 5.1 million Jews had some sort of connection to the religion. Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a synagogue.

Religious (and secular) Jewish movements in the USA and Canada perceive this as a crisis situation, and have grave concern over rising rates of [[Interreligious marriage|intermarriage]] and [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] in the Jewish community. Since American Jews are marrying later in life, and are having fewer children, the birth rate for American Jews has dropped from over 2.0 to 1.7 (the replacement rate is 2.1). (''This is My Beloved, This is My Friend: A Rabbinic Letter on Intimate relations'', p. 27, [[Elliot N. Dorff]], The [[Rabbinical Assembly]], 1996). Intermarriage rates range from 40-50% in the US, and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to intermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5 million in 1990 to 5.1 million in 2001. This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the [[Diaspora]], but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities, such as [[Haredi Judaism]].

The [[Baal teshuva]] movement is a movement of Jews who have "returned" to religion or become more observant. While interest in religion may be on the rise, it has not been sufficient to offset the general demographic loss resulting from intermarriage and [[acculturation]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

{{main|Islam and Judaism}}
{{see also|History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Islam and antisemitism}}

[[Islam and Judaism]] have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and to administer their internal affairs, but subject to certain conditions.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp.10,20</ref> They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-muslim males) to Muslims.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp.10,20</ref> Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.<ref> Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27 </ref> Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The most degrading one was the requirement of [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], not found in the Qur'an or hadith but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]]; its enforcement was highly erratic.<ref>Lewis (1999), p.131</ref> Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.<ref>Lewis (1999), p.131; (1984), pp.8,62</ref> Indeed, the period 712-1066 under the [[Ummayad]]s and the [[Abbasid]]s has been called the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden Age]] of Jewish culture in Spain.  The notable examples of massacre of Jews include the killing or forcibly conversion of them by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]] in the 12th century. <ref>Lewis (1984), p. 52; Stillman (1979), p.77 </ref> Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters ([[mellah]]s) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century. <ref> Lewis (1984), p. 28 </ref> There were some forced conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of North Africa and [[al-Andalus]] as well as in Persia.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp.17,18,94,95; Stillman (1979), p.27</ref> Standard antisemitic themes have become commonplace in the propaganda of Arab Islamic movements such as [[Hizbullah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of [[Refah Partisi]]."<ref name=Lewis_MEQ>[http://www.meforum.org/article/396 Muslim Anti-Semitism] by Bernard Lewis (Middle East Quarterly) June 1998</ref>

====يهوديت او زردشتيت====
For part of its early history, Jews lived under the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Persian Empire]]. Some scholars believe Judaism started off as a western branch of the state religion of the Persian empire, as evidenced by the fact that [[Cyrus the Great]], the first king of the Persian empire, and subsequent Iranian kings funded the construction of the second temple.

===Syncretic beliefs incorporating Judaism===
There are some organizations that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions. The most well-known of these is the [[Messianic Judaism]] movement (closely related to [[Jewish Christians|Hebrew Christianity]]), groups of ethnic Jews and gentiles (non-Jews), historically sponsored by Christian organizations, who promote the belief that [[Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]]. The Jew-to-Gentile ratio of adherents is unknown and can vary widely between bodies of believers.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}  These groups typically combine [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]] and [[Christology]] with a thin veneer of [[Jewish services|Jewish religious practices]]. The most controversial of these groups is the [[United States|American]] [[Jews for Jesus]] which actively proselytizes ethnic Jews through numerous missionary campaigns in major American cities.

Other examples of [[syncretism]] include [[Judeo-Paganism|Judeo-Paganists]], a loosely-organized set of Jews who incorporate pagan or [[Wicca]]n beliefs; [[Jewish Buddhists]], another loosely-organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith; and some [[Jewish Renewal|Renewal Jews]] who borrow freely and openly from [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religion, and other faiths. Some [[Rastafari movement#Haile Selassie and the Bible|Rastafarian]] traditions emphasize a connection to Judaism and believe that [[Black people|Black Africans]] are the true "lost tribe" of Israel.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
