== تاريخ ==
{{main|History of the Netherlands}}
Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Holy Roman Emperor, and king of [[Spain]], the region was part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the Netherlands, which also included most of present-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and some land of [[France]] and [[Germany]]. 1568 saw the start of the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the provinces and Spain.  In 1579, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces declared itself independent from Spain, and they formed the [[Union of Utrecht]], which is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], the son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], was not prepared to let them go that easily and war continued until 1648 when Spain finally recognised Dutch independence.

After gaining formal independence from the [[Spanish Empire]] under [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV]], the Dutch grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers of the 17th century during the period of the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. In the era, referred to as the [[Dutch Golden Age]], colonies and [[trading post]]s were established all over the globe. (See [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonial empire]])

Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly [[capitalism|capitalist]] country in the world. In early modern Europe it featured the wealthiest trading city ([[Amsterdam]]) and the first full-time [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. The inventiveness of the traders led to [[insurance]] and retirement funds as well as such less benign phenomena as the boom-bust cycle, the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the [[tulip mania]] of 1636–1637, and according to Murray Sayle, the world's first bear raider - Isaac le Maire, who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount<ref>"Japan Goes Dutch", ''London Review of Books'' [April 5, 2001]: 3-7).</ref>

After briefly being incorporated in the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], the Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815, consisting of the present day Netherlands, [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]. In addition, the king of the Netherlands became hereditary [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. Belgium rebelled and gained independence in 1830, while the [[personal union]] between [[Luxembourg]] and the Netherlands was severed in 1890 as a result of ascendancy laws which prevented [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] from becoming Grand Duke.

The Netherlands possessed several colonies, most notably the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and [[Suriname]] (the latter was traded with the British for [[New Amsterdam]], now known as [[New York]]). These 'colonies' were first administered by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], both collective private enterprises. Three centuries later these companies got into financial trouble and the territories in which they operated were taken over by the Dutch government (in 1815 and 1791 respectively). Only then did they become official colonies.

During the 19th century, the Netherlands was slow to industrialise compared to neighbouring countries, mainly due to its unique infrastructure of waterways and reliance on wind power. The Netherlands remained neutral in [[World War I]] and intended to do so in [[World War II]]. However, [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Netherlands in 1940 in the Western European campaign of the second world war, Subsequently the Netherlands joined the Anglo-French alliance, asking them for help. The country was quickly overrun and then occupied; although a British expeditionary force held Zeeland for a while.  During the occupation over 100,000 Dutch [[Jew]]s were murdered in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] along with significant numbers of Dutch [[Roma people|Roma]] (gypsies).  The allied [[21st Army Group]] was given the task to conduct military operations to liberate The Netherlands after the breakout from [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]]. British, Canadian, Polish and American soldiers fought on Dutch soil beginning in September 1944 culminating in the (failed) operation [[Market-Garden]]. Allied focus now shifted to the German heartland and the country was only liberated on 5 May 1945 (just 3 days before the unconditional surrender of all German troops on May 8). The disrupted infrastructure, due to allied advances, and German confiscation of many goods made the winter of 1944-1945 one in which malnutrition and starvation were rife among the Dutch population. After the war, the Dutch economy prospered by, after leaving behind an era of neutrality, thorough bonding with neighbouring states. The Netherlands became member of the [[Benelux]] ('''Be'''lgium, the '''Ne'''therlands and '''Lux'''embourg) cooperation. Furthermore, the Netherlands was among the twelve founding members of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and among the six founding members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]].

== Naming conventions ==
{{main|Netherlands (terminology)}}

Various terms have been used in English to refer to the Netherlands and its inhabitants.

'(The) Netherlands' is the official name of the European part of the 'Kingdom of the Netherlands'. The term '[[Holland]]' is commonly used as a synonym for the Netherlands, but the word Holland derives from a region in the west of the country that currently makes up two of the twelve provinces, namely [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]]. The country's [[Dutch people|people]] and [[Dutch language|language]] are called 'Dutch'. The term '[[Low Countries]]' is used sometimes to refer to the Netherlands, but technically it refers to a bigger region in Western Europe, including Belgium and Luxembourg.

To address this confusion some solutions have been proposed, for instance, in [[linguistics]], the term '''Netherlandic''' has been coined{{reference needed}}.

<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands has been a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] since 1848 and a constitutional monarchy since 1815; before that it had been a [[republic]] from 1581 to 1806 and a kingdom between 1806 and 1810 (it was part of [[France]] between 1810 and 1813). The [[head of state]] is the monarch (at present [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]]). The monarch has today in practice a mainly ceremonial function but the constitution allows for the exertion of real power, should the responsible ministers subordinate themselves; an open conflict between them and the monarch — whose signature is needed for any law or warrant to come into effect — would lead to a constitutional crisis (see [[د نېدرلانډ/هالېنډ سياست#Executive branch|main article]]). 

Dutch governments have since the 19th century always consisted of a coalition, as there was not a single political party large enough to get the majority vote. Formally, the monarch appoints the members of the government. In practice, once the results of parliamentary elections are known, a [[coalition government]] is formed (in a process of negotiations that has taken up to seven months), after which the government formed in this way is officially appointed by the monarch. The head of the government is the [[Prime Minister]], in Dutch ''Minister President'' or ''Premier'', a [[primus inter pares]] who is usually also the leader of the largest party in the coalition. The degree of influence the monarch has on actual government formation is a topic of ongoing speculation.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Tweedekamer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Tweede Kamer|Second Chamber]] of parliament]]  -->
The parliament consists of two houses. The 150 members of the Lower House (''Tweede Kamer'', or Second Chamber) are elected every four years in [[direct election]]s. The provincial assemblies are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect every two years a third of the members of the less important Senate (the ''Eerste Kamer'', or First Chamber that is hereby fully [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] within six years), that can merely reject laws, not propose or amend them. Together, the First and Second Chamber are known as the ''Staten-Generaal'', the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States General]].

On [[February 7]], 2006, the [[Tweede Kamer|Second Chamber]] introduced the citizens' initiative right at the national level.<ref>[http://www.democracy-international.org/dutch-initiative.html Web reference]</ref> 

Political scientists consider the Netherlands to be a classic example of a [[consociational state]], traditionally explained by the necessity since the early Middle Ages for different social groups to cooperate in order to fight the water. Better founded hypotheses include a partial failing of [[feudalism|feodalisation]] and the successful resistance against [[absolutism]]. This system of reaching an agreement despite differences is called the [[Polder Model|polder model]] in Dutch. Also, the Netherlands has long been a nation of traders, dominated by a freethinking [[bourgeoisie]] and for international trade one has to be [[tolerant]] of an other person's culture; at home, despite [[calvinism]] being till the 19th century the [[state religion]], there was in practice much [[religious tolerance]] shown towards [[Catholics]] and [[Jews]]. Nevertheless Catholics were practically not allowed to hold government functions until the [[19th century]] and in regards to Catholic, but also Jewish, church buildings, Protestant restrictions were observed. Until the middle of the [[19th century]] Catholics were rarely allowed to build new churches which were visibly Catholic. The Netherlands tried between 1839 and 1940 to be a neutral country in most international affairs and thus managed to keep out of [[World War I]] (although this failed in [[World War II]]). As a result, the Dutch have a 'friendly' reputation in other countries, to the point that bearers of a Dutch passport often have relatively little difficulty getting into other countries, for visits or even for emigration purposes. 

However, the early years of the 21st century have seen a political change with the right wing in politics gaining on the left. This is illustrated by the quick rise (and fall) of the [[List Pim Fortuyn|LPF]]. [[Pim Fortuyn]], its founder, held former cabinets responsible for the presumed failing integration of immigrants. 

The present government is led by the minority cabinet [[Third Balkenende cabinet|Balkenende III]], a short-term continuation of [[Second Balkenende cabinet|Balkenende II]] ([[CDA]]/[[VVD]]/[[Democrats 66|D66]]) without the smallest coalition party, [[Democrats 66|D66]]. Elections are planned for [[November 22]], [[2006]].

Balkenende II's economic reforms and controversial immigration policies had resulted in a shift in public opinion to the left, showing from political polls and the 2006 municipal elections, in which the government coalition parties faced great losses in favour of the opposition parties, mainly the Labour Party (PvdA) and the Socialist Party (SP). Following the controversial decisions of minister [[Verdonk]] regarding the legal status of immigrant politician [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], the Dutch cabinet went into crisis on [[June 29]], [[2006]]. Jan-Peter Balkenende presented his temporary minority cabinet to the Queen on [[July 7]].

On [[June 1]] 2005 the Dutch electorate voted in a [[Dutch referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] against the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|EU Constitution]] by a majority of 61.6%, three days after the French had also voted against.

Dutch policies on [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]], [[prostitution]], [[same-sex marriage]] and [[euthanasia]] are among the most liberal in the world.

The Netherlands is divided into twelve administrative regions, called [[province]]s, each under a [[Governor]], who is called ''Commissaris van de Koningin'' (Commissioner of the Queen), except for the province [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] where the commissioner is called Gouverneur ([[Governor]]) which underlines the more "non-Dutch" mentality.

All provinces are divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] (''gemeenten''), 458 in total ([[1 January]] [[2006]]). 

The country is also subdivided in water districts, governed by a water board (''waterschap'' or ''hoogheemraadschap''), each having authority in matters concerning water management. As of [[1 January]] [[2005]] there are 27. The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. In fact, the Dutch water boards are one of the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence.

== جغرافيه ==
{{main|Geography of the Netherlands}}
A remarkable aspect of the Netherlands is the flatness of the country. Hilly landscapes can be found only in the central part and the south-eastern tip of the country.

About half of its surface area is less than 1 metre (3.3&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]], and large parts of it are actually below sea level (see [http://www.minbuza.nl/default.asp?CMS_ITEM=MBZ302750 map showing these areas]). An extensive range of [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] and [[dunes]] protects these areas from flooding. Numerous massive pumping stations keep the ground water level in check. The highest point, the [[Vaalserberg]], in the south-eastern most point of the country, is 321 metres (1,053&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The [[Vaalserberg]] is a foothill of the [[Ardennes]]mountains. A substantial part of the Netherlands, for example, all of the province of [[Flevoland]] (contains the largest man-made island in the world) and large parts of [[Holland]], has been reclaimed from the sea. These areas are known as [[polder]]s. This has led to the saying "God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands."

In years past, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably due to human intervention and natural disasters. Most notable in terms of land loss are the 1134 storm, which created the [[archipelago]] of Zeeland in the south west, and the 1287 storm, which killed 50,000 people and created the [[Zuider Zee|''Zuyderzee'']] (now dammed in and renamed the ''IJsselmeer'' — see below) in the northwest, giving Amsterdam direct access to the sea. The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder, replacing it with the 72 square kilometres (28&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The most recent parts of Zeeland were flooded during the [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea Flood of 1953]] and 1,836 people were killed, after which the ''[[Delta Works|Delta Plan]]'' was executed.

[[دوتنه:Satellite image of the Netherlands in May 2000.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Satellite image of the Netherlands (ca. May 2000)]] 
The disasters were partially man-made; the people drained relatively high lying swampland for use as farmland. This drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to compress and the ground level to drop, locking the land users in a vicious circle whereby they would lower the water level to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to compress even more. The vicious circle is unsolvable and remains to this day. Up until the 19th century peat was dug up, dried, and used for fuel, further adding to the problem.

To guard against floods, a series of defenses against the water were contrived. In the first millennium, villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''"waterschappen"'' (English "water bodies") or ''"hoogheemraadschappen"'' ("high home councils") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods. (The water bodies are still around today performing the exact same function.) As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. In the 13th century, windmills came into use to pump water out of the areas by now below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s. In 1932, the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (English "Closure Dike") was completed, blocking the former ''Zuyderzee'' (Southern Sea) off from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake). It became part of the larger [[Zuiderzee Works]] in which four polders totalling 1,650 square kilometres (637&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) were reclaimed from the sea.

After the 1953 disaster, the [[Delta Works|Delta project]], a vast construction effort designed to end the threat from the sea once and for all, was launched in 1958 and largely completed in 2002. The official goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in Holland to once per 10,000 years. (For the rest of the country, the protection-level is once per 4,000 years.) This was achieved by raising 3,000 kilometres (1,864&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of outer sea-dikes and 10,000 kilometres (6,200&nbsp;mi) of inner, canal, and river dikes to "delta" height, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally incur additional Delta project work in the form of dike reinforcements. The Delta project is the single largest construction effort in human history and is considered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World|seven wonders of the modern world]].

Because of the high cost of maintaining the polders some have argued that maybe some of the deepest polders should be given up. Additionally, the Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from [[Climate change|climatic change]]. Not only is the rising sea a problem, but also erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow. These flooded polders might then be used as water catchments to take part of the blow.

The country is divided into two main parts by three rivers [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), [[Waal]], and [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas''). The south-western part of the Netherlands is actually one big [[river delta]] of these rivers. These rivers not only function as a natural barrier, but also as a cultural divide, as is evident in the different [[dialect]]s spoken north and south of these great rivers and the (previous) religious dominance of Catholics in the south and Calvinists in the north.

The predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is south-west, which causes a moderate [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with cool summers and mild winters.

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|Economy of the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands has a prosperous and [[open economy]] in which the government has reduced its role since the 1980s. Industrial activity is predominantly in food-processing (for example [[Unilever]] and [[Heineken]]), chemicals (for example [[DSM (company)|DSM]]), [[petroleum]] refining (for example [[Royal Dutch Shell]]), and electrical machinery (for example [[Philips]]). [[Slochteren]] has one of the largest [[natural gas field]]s in the world, which has so far (2006) resulted in a total revenue of €159 billion since the mid 1970s. With just over half of the reserves used up and an expected continued rise in oil prices, the revenues over the next few decades are expected to be at least that much.<ref>[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/25899792/ web reference]</ref> A highly mechanised [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector employs no more than 4% of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Dutch rank third worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the [[United States|US]] and [[France]]. Other important parts of the economy are [[international trade]] (Dutch colonialism started with cooperative private enterprises such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]), [[banking]] and [[transport]] (for example the [[Rotterdam]] harbour). The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners.

As a founding member of the [[Euro]], the Netherlands replaced its former [[currency]], the [[Dutch guilder|guilder]], on [[January 1]] [[1999]] along with the other adopters of the single European currency, with the actual [[Euro coins]] and [[Euro banknotes|banknotes]] following on [[January 1]], [[2002]]. However, in the first years of the third millennium, economic and employment growth came to a standstill, which the government tried to resolve by cutting into its expenses.

In 2003 the economy shrunk 0.9%. In 2004, the recession was over and the economy began its slow recovery with a meagre 1.3% growth. The CPB (''"Centraal Plan Bureau"'', Central Planning Bureau), a think tank of leading Dutch economists linked with the government, expects a recovery of the economy in 2005, with a growth of 2.25%. In 2004, inflation was 1.2%, the lowest level since 1989.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of the Netherlands}}
[[دوتنه:Netherlands-demography.png|thumb|200px|right|Demographics of Netherlands, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

The Netherlands is the 23rd [[List of countries by population density|most densely populated]] country in the world, with 395 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,023&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)—or 484 people per square kilometre (1,254/sq&nbsp;mi) if only the land area is counted, since 18.4% is water. Partly because of this it is also one of the most densely cabled countries in the world. Internet penetration is at 66.2% the 7th highest in the world.<ref>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/top25.htm internetworldstats.com] </ref>

According to [[CBS Statline]], the official statistics bureau of the Netherlands, the ethnic origins of the citizens are very diverse. The vast majority of the population however still remains [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. They were: 80.8% [[Dutch people|Dutch]], 5.6% other [[Western European]] (including 2.4% [[German people|German]]), 2.4% [[Indonesia]]n ([[Indo|Indo-European]], Indo-Dutch, [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan]]), 2.2% [[Turkish people|Turks]], 2.0% [[Suriname]]se, 1.9% [[Morocco|Moroccan]], 0.8% [[Netherlands Antilles|Antillean]] and [[Aruba]]n, and 4.2% other. However, this does not include the whole Kingdom of the Netherlands (such as the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, which have a non-European majority  community), and only include the population in the Netherlands itself. The Netherlands also has a resident population of some 200,000 people of mixed Dutch and [[Indonesia]]n descent (Indonesia being a [[Dutch East Indies|former colony]] of the Netherlands). 

There are no cities with a population over 1 million in the Netherlands, but the 'four big cities' as they are called ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) can in many ways be regarded as one 'big city' agglomeration, the [[Randstad]] ('fringe city') with about 7 million inhabitants and an agricultural 'green heart' (het [[Groene Hart]]). This is illustrated by the idea to create a circular train network with a frequency and carriages similar to a [[Metropolitan Line|metropolitan railway]].

The 5 largest cities are, in order of descending population:
* [[Amsterdam]]
* [[Rotterdam]]
* [[The Hague]] ([[Den Haag]])
* [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] 
* [[Eindhoven]].

[[Eindhoven]] is the only of these cities that is not located in the [[Randstad]].

The population of the Netherlands is physically the tallest in the world, with an average height of 1.83 m (6 ft ) for adult males and 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) for adult females.  A few centuries ago, it was among the shortest.  The reasons for the increase in height are uncertain (CBS 2006).

=== Languages ===
The official language is [[Dutch language|Dutch]], which is spoken by practically all inhabitants. Another official language is [[Frisian language|Frisian]], which is spoken in the northern province of [[Friesland]] and has a strong resemblance to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and especially [[English language|English]]. Frisian is co-official only in the province of Friesland, although with a few restrictions. Several dialects of [[Low Saxon]] (''Nedersaksisch'' in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognised by the Netherlands as ''regional languages'' according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. To the south, the Dutch language shifts into other varieties of [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] and German, which may or may not be best classified as Dutch, most notably [[West Flemish language|West Flemish]]. One of these, [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], which is spoken in the south-eastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], has been recognised as a minority language since 1997. There is a tradition of speaking foreign languages in the Netherlands: about 85% of the total population speaks [[English language|English]], 55–60% speaks [[German language|German]] and about 17% speaks [[French language|French]]. Note, though, that these percentages do not represent fluency, but basic knowledge.

=== مذهب ===
According to the governmental statistics agency ([[Statistics Netherlands|CBS]]) 30% of the population consider themselves to be [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], 20% [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (predominantly [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]]) and 8% 'other denominations'. 42% consider themselves unaffiliated. Church attendance however is much lower than these figures may suggest: some 70% of the population 'rarely or never' visit a house of worship (be it a church, mosque, synagogue or temple), and even then it is mostly for occasions like weddings and baptisms. Most Protestants live in the northern provinces while the southern provinces,  [[North Brabant|Noord-Brabant]] and [[Limburg]], are mainly [[Roman Catholic]], along with some regions in the east of the country like [[Twente]] in [[Overijssel]].

The largest part of the 'other denominations', at 920,000, are [[Islam|Muslim]] immigrants mainly living in the bigger cities, mostly from [[Morocco]] and [[Turkey]], and their descendants. The other denominations also include some 200,000 [[Hindu]]s (1.3% of the population), mostly descendants of [[indentured servant]]s who migrated from [[India]] to the former Dutch colony of [[Surinam]] around 1900. 

During the Nazi occupation in [[The Netherlands in World War II|World War II]] about 100,000 out of 140,000 Dutch [[Judaism|Jews]] were murdered in [[extermination camps]]. The Jewish population of the Netherlands today is estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. They are mostly [[Liberal Judaism|Liberal]] in practice, rather than [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].

{{main|Culture of the Netherlands}}
One of the main characteristics of the Dutch culture is the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blunt bluntness].  Their proverbial bluntless is not to everyone's taste. The Dutch are also so committed to equality, compromise and avoiding conflict that they have created a labyrinth of rules and regulations from which there is no easy exit. Dutch obsession with equality and keeping everything "normal" is reflected in one of the most famous Dutch sayings which says: "Doe maar gewoon, dan doe je al gek genoeg" (Behave normally, that's mad enough).
The term in English that demonstrates a stereotype of Dutch behaviour is [[Dutch uncle]]. A Dutch uncle is someone who believes himself to be practical, direct, outspoken, stubborn, well-organised, blunt, and thinks he is always right. (See the source below p. 38). The Dutch are also very prone to grumbling and complaining. According to the writer of the "Culture shock, the Netherlands" this is the result of the fact that the Dutch think they know how matters really should be arranged.

The Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, when the Dutch republic was prosperous, was the age of the "Dutch Masters" such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]] and many others. Famous Dutch [[painters]] of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M.C. Escher|M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.  [[Han van Meegeren]] was an infamous Dutch [[art forgery|art forger]].

The Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], and all of [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done there. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) discovered Saturn's moon Titan and invented the [[pendulum clock]].

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]], [[literature]] flowered as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the bad treatment of the natives in Dutch colonies. Important 20th century authors include [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard van het Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Diary of a Young Girl]]'' was published after she died in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.

Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in Huis ten Bosch, [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]].

[[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[clogs|wooden shoes]], and [[Delftware]] pottery are among the items associated with the Netherlands.

[[Efteling]] is a famous amusement park in the Netherlands.
