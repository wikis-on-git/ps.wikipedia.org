The '''Marshall Islands''', officially the '''Republic of the Marshall Islands''' (RMI), is a [[Micronesia]]n [[island nation]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]], located north of [[Nauru]] and [[Kiribati]], east of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and south of the U.S. territory of [[Wake Island]].

== History ==
{{main|History of the Marshall Islands}}

While settled by [[Micronesia]]ns in the [[2nd millennium BC]], little is known of the early history of the islands. [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Alonso de Salazar]] was the first [[Europe]]an to sight the Marshalls in [[1526]], but the islands remained virtually unvisited by Europeans for several more centuries, before being visited by [[England|English]] captain [[John Marshall (British captain)|John Marshall]] in [[1788]]; the islands owe their name to him.

A [[Germany|German]] trading company settled on the islands in [[1885]], and they became part of the [[protectorate]] of [[German New Guinea]] some years later. [[Japan]] conquered the islands in [[World War I]], and administered them as a [[League of Nations mandate]].

In [[World War II]], the [[United States]] invaded the islands ([[1944]]), and they were added to the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (including several more island groups in the South Sea). 

In [[1979]] the Republic of the Marshall Islands was established and a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the U.S. government was signed, becoming effective in [[1986]]. The independence was formally completed under international law in [[1990]], when the UN officially ended the trust given to the USA.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|Municipalities of the Marshall Islands}} 

The Marshall Islands have no formal administrative division, but are divided into 25 legislative districts, which correspond to the inhabited islands and atolls of the country.

* [[Ailinglaplap Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Ailuk Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Arno Atoll|Arno]] (legislative district)
* [[Aur Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Ebon Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Enewetak Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Jabat Island]] (legislative district)
* [[Jaluit Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Kili Island]] (legislative district)
* [[Kwajalein Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Lae Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Lib Island]] (legislative district)
* [[Likiep Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Majuro Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Maloelap Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Mejit Island]] (legislative district)
* [[Mili Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Namorik Atoll]] (or Namdrik; legislative district)
* [[Namu Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Rongelap Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Ujae Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Ujelang Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Utirik Atoll]] (or Utrik; legislative district)
* [[Wotho Atoll]] (legislative district)
* [[Wotje Atoll]] (legislative district)

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the Marshall Islands}}
[[دوتنه:RMImap-CIA.jpg|right|thumb|420px|Map of the Marshall Islands]]
[[دوتنه:ClimateMajuroMarshallIslands.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Average monthly temperatures (red) and precipitation (blue) on [[Majuro]].]] 
The country consists of 29 [[atoll]]s and 5 isolated islands. The most important atolls and islands form two groups: the [[Ratak Chain]] and the [[Ralik Chain]] (meaning "sunrise" and "sunset" chains). Two-thirds of the nation's population lives on Majuro (which is also the capital) and Ebeye.  The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development.  Life on the outer atolls is generally still fairly traditional, and the nutrition of the rural population, being grown and caught, is superior that of most of the urban residents, who rely considerably on white rice.

The uninhabited atolls include:

* [[Ailinginae Atoll]]
* [[Bikar Atoll]] (or Bikaar)
* [[Bikini Atoll]]
* [[Bokak Atoll]]
* [[Erikub Atoll]]
* [[Jemo Island]]
* [[Nadikdik Atoll]] (or Knox)
* [[Rongerik Atoll]]
* [[Toke Atoll]]

The climate is hot and humid, with a wet season from May to November. The islands occasionally suffer from [[typhoon]]s.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of the Marshall Islands}}

[[United States]] Government assistance is the mainstay of the economy. Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial crops are [[coconut]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[breadfruit]]. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and [[copra]]. The tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. Around 1999 a tuna loining plant was built and employed upwards of 400 people, mostly women.  After absorbing significant training costs and lack of government assistance the plant was closed in 2005.  Although the plant brought almost $6 million into the economy, and provided a significant number of jobs that previously had not existed, the government let the plant close and chose not to provide any incentives to the owners to keep it open. Under the terms of the Amended [[Compact of Free Association]], the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2023, at which time a Trust Fund made up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts. Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline in tourism and foreign investment due to the Asian financial difficulties, and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1% over the past decade. 

The United States also maintains the U.S. Army's [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site]] on [[Kwajalein]] Atoll.  It is an important aspect of the Marshallese economy, as the Marshallese land owners receive rent for the base, and a large number of Marshallese work at the base. It is noted that the Majuro Atoll benefited from many foreign assistances. The main airport was built by the Japanese (during [[World War II]]), the only tarmac road of the capital was built by the Americans.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of the Marshall Islands}}

The Marshallese are of [[Micronesia]]n origin and migrated from Asia several thousand years ago. Although [[English language|English]] is an official language and is spoken widely, although not fluently, [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] is used by the government. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is also occasionally spoken in some areas of Marshall Islands.

Virtually all Marshallese are [[Christianity|Christian]], most of them [[Protestantism|Protestant]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of the Marshall Islands}}

Although now in decline, the Marshallese were once able navigators, using the stars and stick and shell charts. They are also experienced in [[canoe]] building and still hold annual competitions involving the unique oceanic sailing canoe, the [[proa]].

== Nuclear testing ==
Between 1946 and 1958 the USA tested 67 [[nuclear weapons]] in the Marshall Islands, including the largest [[nuclear test]] the US ever conducted, [[Castle Bravo]], which resulted in the [[radiation poisoning]] of 236 Marshallese. Nuclear claims between the United States and the Marshall Islands are ongoing, and health effects still linger from these tests. (see [[Rongelap]])

== Mexican Fishermen ==

On [[October]] of [[2005]], [[Mexican]] [[fishermen]] got lost in the sea and a [[Taiwanese]] boat found them alive 9 months after, close to the [[Marshall Islands]] where they set foot again on [[August 9]] of [[2006]]. They are still is [[Asia]] in a [[hospital]] and are waiting to return to [[Mexico]].
