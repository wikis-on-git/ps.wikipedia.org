A '''nurse''' is a [[healthcare professional]] who, in collaboration with other members of a health care team, is responsible for: treatment, safety, and recovery of [[Acute (medical)|acutely]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronically]] ill individuals; health promotion and maintenance within families, communities and populations; and, treatment of life-threatening emergencies in a wide range of health care settings. Nurses perform a wide range of clinical and non-clinical functions necessary to the delivery of health care, and may also be involved in [[medical research|medical]] and [[nursing research]].

Both [[Nursing]] roles and education were first defined by [[Florence Nightingale]], following her experiences caring for the wounded in the [[Crimean War]].<ref name="TOM"> Tomey, A. M. and Alligood, M. R. (2006). Nursing Theorists and their Work (6th ed.). Mosby: St. Louis.</ref> Prior to this, [[nursing]] was thought to be a [[trade (profession)|trade]] with few common practices or documented standards. Nightingale's concepts were used as a guide for establishing nursing schools at the beginning of the twentieth century, which were mostly hospital-based training programs emphasizing the development of a set of clinical skills.<ref name="TOM"/> The profession's early utilization of a general, hospital-based education is sometimes credited for the wide range of roles nurses have assumed within health care, and this is contrasted with present-day nursing education, which is increasingly specialized and typically offered at post-secondary institutions.<ref> Barr, O. and Sines, D. (2009). The development of the generalist nurse within preregistration nurse education in the UK: some points for consideration. Nurse Education Today, 4, 274-277.</ref>

Practice as a nurse is often defined by [[federated state|state]], [[province|provincial]] or [[territory (administrative division)|territorial]] governments. As an example, the province of [[Ontario]] classifies nurses into the roles of [[Registered Practical Nurse]], [[Registered Nurse|Registered Nurse (general class)]], and [[nurse practitioner|Registered Nurse (extended class)]].<ref name="GOV"> Government of Ontario, Nursing Act, S.O. C-32 (1991). Retrieved from http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_91n32_e.htm</ref> In this respect, the title "nurse" is protected by law within the province, and regulated by legislative statute.<ref name="GOV"/> Some regions have legislated different or expanded roles for nurses, generating many potential nurse careers.

Around the world, nurses are often female. However, in [[Francophone Africa]], which includes the countries of [[Benin]], [[Burkino Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Ivory Coast]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Djibouti]], [[Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], and [[Togo]], there are more male than female nurses.<ref name="MIN">[http://books.google.ca/books?id=-Ag7TqTyIC0C&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=Nurses+spain+males&source=bl&ots=5YiyohJZGv&sig=S7y246l0WaSmFL7m0QvVNyatogo&hl=en&ei=DeIJSpNpn7Iwn4et4Qs&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#PPP1,M1 Men in nursing By Chad E. O'Lynn, Russell E. Tranbarger]</ref> In [[Europe]], in countries such as [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Italy]], over 20% of nurses are male.<ref name="MIN"/>

Currently, a [[nursing shortage]] exists within the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and a number of other developed countries.<ref name="SIG"> Sigma Theta Tau, International Honor Society of Nursing (2001, July). Facts About the Nursing Shortage. Retrieved from http://www.nursesource.org/facts_shortage.html</ref> The majority of analysis refers to a shortage of [[Registered Nurse]] staff.<ref name="SIG"/> The Canadian [[Registered Nurse]] shortage has been linked to longer wait times for hospital-based procedures, increased adverse events for patients, and more stressful work environments.<ref>Canadian Nurses Association (2009, July). Report: Tested Solutions for Eliminating Canada's Registered Nurse Shortage.</ref> As the shortage of [[Registered Nurses]] increases, it is expected that there will be an increasing move towards utilizing unregulated healthcare workers to meet demands for basic nursing care within hospitals and the community.<ref>Pan-Canadian Planning Committee on Unregulated Health Workers (2009, August). Maximizing Health Human Resources: Valuing Unregulated Health Workers.They now use computer to help their patient. Retrieved from http://www.cna-nurses.ca/CNA/documents/pdf/publications/UHW_Final_Report_e.pdf.</ref> 

==Etymology==
The English word ''nurse'' also refers to the act of [[breastfeeding]].<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the [[English Language]], 4th edition, via [http://www.answers.com/nurse Nurse] at Answers.com</ref> A [[wet nurse]] is considered someone who provides her own breast-milk to infants. In other languages, the word for ''nurse'' comes from the same etymology as the word [[infirmary]], such as in [[French language|French]] (''infirmier''), or [[Italian language|Italian]] (''infermiere'').

==Education==
Typically, nurses are distinguished from one another by the area they work in (critical care, perioperative, oncology, nephrology, pediatrics, adult acute care, geriatrics, psychiatric, community, occupational health, etc.). Bodies such as the ''American Nurses Association'' and the ''Canadian Nurses Association'' have both supported a move towards the creation of [[nursing board certification|national specialty certifications]], in order to support more specialized nursing roles.<ref> [http://www.cna-aiic.ca/CNA/nursing/certification/default_e.aspx], [http://www.nursecredentialing.org/Certification.aspx] </ref> As nursing roles and specialties are continually changing, the ''International Council of Nurses'' states that nursing education should always include continuing education activities; while educational preparation is expected to vary between countries, all nursing jurisdictions are encouraged to promote continuing education as an important form of professional education.<ref>International Council of Nurses (2004). Position Statement: Continuing competence as a professional responsibility and public right.</ref>

[[Nurse education|Nursing education]] varies widely, and continues to produce an array of options as nursing roles evolve and also expand in scope. Educational preparation as a nurse may include [[certificate]], [[Diploma in Nursing|diploma]], [[Associate of Science in Nursing|associates]], [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|bachelors]], [[Master of Science in Nursing|masters]] or [[Doctorate in Nursing|doctoral]] preparation.
