== تاريخ ==
''Main articles: [[Illyria]], [[Illyricum]], [[Dalmatia]], [[History of Albania]].''

The earlier inhabitants were probably part of the pre-Indo-European populace that occupied the coastline of most parts of the Mediterranean. Their physical remains are scarce though, and concentrated on the coastal region. Soon, these first inhabitants were overrun by the Proto-Hellenic tribes that gradually occupied modern-day Greece, southern parts of what is now the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the south of present-day Albania. This process was completed over the second millennium BC and did not really affect northern or central Albania, an area that at the time presented the image of a political vacuum (in essence a historical paradox).

Historians do not agree over the origin of the [[Illyrians]]. Some of them maintain that the Illyrians descended from the pre-Indo-European [[Pelasgians]], while most scholars place them in the later wave of Indo-European invasions. Their presence can be traced back to 900 BC, when their political structure was formulated in the [[7th century BC|7th]] and [[6th century BC|6th]] centuries BC. Excellent metal craftsmen and fierce warriors, the Illyrians formed warlord based kingdoms that fought amongst themselves for most of their history. Only during the 6th century did the Illyrians venture significant raids against their immediate neighbours: the kingdom of the [[Molossians]] in southern Albania, the kingdom of [[Macedon]], and the kingdom of [[Paionia]].

Besides warfare, the [[Illyrians]] were also peaceful traders of agricultural products and metal works. The [[Illyrian]] culture was heavily influenced by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture (mainly the south Illyrian tribes). Albania is also the site of several ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies.

=== Macedonian Rule ===
Probably their most important success was the slaughter of [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], king of Macedon. Unfortunately for the [[Illyrians]], [[Perdiccas]] was succeeded by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], father of [[Alexander the Great]], who effectively terminated the [[Illyrian]] aggression, effectively ending any dominant control by the [[Illyrians]] in the region.

=== Roman and Byzantine Rule ===
After being conquered by the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was reorganized as a [[Roman]] province, [[Illyricum]], later divided into the provinces of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]], the lands comprising Albania mostly being included in [[Dalmatia]]. Later, the [[Byzantine Empire]] governed the region. It was also ruled by the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian Empire]]. After centuries, use of the name ''Illyria'' to denote the region fell out of fashion.

=== Ottoman Rule ===
In the middle ages, the name ''Albania'' (see ''[[Origin and history of the name Albania]]'') began to be increasingly applied to the region now comprising the nation of Albania. From [[1443]] to [[1468]] [[Skanderbeg|Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu]] led a successful resistance against the invading [[Ottomans]]. After the death of [[Skenderbeg]], resistance continued until [[1478]], although with only moderate success. The loyalties and alliances created and nurtured by [[Skenderbeg]] faltered and fell apart, and the [[Ottomans]] conquered the territory of Albania shortly after the fall of the [[castle]] [[Kruje]]. '''Albania''' then became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Following this, many Albanians fled to neighboring [[Italy]], and the majority of the '''Albanian''' population that remained converted to the [[Muslim]] religion. They would remain a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until [1912].

=== د بالکاني جنګونو اغېزې ===
After the [[Balkan Wars|Second Balkan War]], the [[Ottomans]] were removed from Albania and there was a possibility of the lands being absorbed by [[Serbia]], and the southern tip by [[Greece]]. This decision angered the [[Italians]] who did not want [[Serbia]] to have an extended coastline, and it angered the [[German people|Germans]] who could build a railway to reach the Orient. [[Berlin]] then held discussions with [[Russia]] (the superpower in charge of [[Serbia]]) and with [[Greece]]. Eventually, it was decided that the country should not be divided but instead consolidated into the [[Principality]] of Albania under a German [[prince]],[[William of Wied]]. When the German [[prince]] was expelled by the [[Albanian]] people after 6 months as the self named "King of Albania", [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], as members the [[League of Nations]], wanted to divide the territory once and for all. Intervention by [[United States of America]] [[president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] vetoed the vote and allowed Albania to retain its status. From [[1928]], the country was ruled by [[Zog of Albania|King Zog I]] until [[1938]] when it became a puppet of [[Italy]].

=== دوهمه نړېواله جګړه ===
Albanian communists and nationalists actively fought a partisan war against the Italian and German invasions in WW II.  Certain smaller organizations helped the foreign invaders, but it was the [[communists]] (formed in [[1941]]) who took over after [[World War II]]. In November [[1944]] the communists gained control of the government under the leader of the resistance, [[Enver Hoxha]] . From [[1945]] until [[1990]] Albania had one of the most repressive governments in [[Europe]], tolerating no opposition.

=== Enver Hoxha Rule ===
For many decades of his domination, Hoxha created and destroyed relationships with Belgrade, Moscow, and China, always in his personal interests. The country was isolated, first from the West (Western Europe, North America and Australasia) and later even from the communist East. 

In 1985, Enver Hoxha died and [[Ramiz Alia]] took his place. Initially, Alia tried to follow in Hoxha's footsteps, but in Eastern Europe the changes had already started: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had appeared in the [[Soviet Union]] with new policies ([[Glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]). The totalitarian regime was pressured by the US and Europe and the anger and dispair of its own people. After [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] (the communist leader of [[Romania]]) was executed in a revolution, Alia knew he would be next if changes were not made. He signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] (which was signed by other countries in 1975) that respected some [[human rights]]. He also allowed [[pluralism]], and even though his party won the election of 1991 it was clear that the change would not be stopped. In 1992 the general elections were won by the Democratic Party with 62% of the votes.

In the general elections of June 1996 the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority and manipulated the results. In 1997 the economic fraud of the [[pyramid schemes]] shocked the entire government and riots started. Police stations and military bases were looted of millions of weaponry - mostly [[Kalashnikov]]s. Anarchy prevailed and many cities were controlled by militia and armed citizens. Even the US military advisors left the country for safety. This anarchy and rebellion caused the Socialist Party to win the early elections of 1997. To this day, the sudden rise of these militia and the prevalence of mafia style local overlords means it is difficult to consider Albania in a European sense as a unified country governed by its capital.

However, stability was far from being restored in the years after the 1997 riots. The power feuds raging inside the Socialist Party led to a series of short-lived Socialist governments. The country was flooded with refugees from neighboring Kosovo in 1998 and 1999. In June, 2002, a compromise candidate, Alfred Moisiu, a former general and defense minister, was elected to succeed President Meidani. Parliamentary elections in July, 2005, brought back to power Sali Berisha, Leader of the Democratic Party, mostly owing to the Socialist power infighting and a series of corruption scandals plaguing the Nano government.

Since 1990 Albania has been oriented towards the West, it was accepted to the Council of Europe and has requested membership of [[NATO]]. The working force of Albania has continued to emigrate to Greece, Italy, Europe and North America. Corruption in the government is becoming more and more obvious. The politics have not yet fulfilled the people's hope for a short and not too painful transition.

== سياست ==
''Main article:'' [[Politics of Albania]]

The head of state is the president, who is elected by the ''[[Kuvendi]]'', or the Assembly of the Republic of Albania every 5 years. The main part of the Assembly's 140 members is elected every 4 years. 100 of the parliament's members are chosen by the people with a direct vote, while the other 40 members are chosen using a proportional system. The head of government is the Prime Minister who is assisted by a council of ministers.  The Council of Ministers is selected by the Prime Minister (A process called "forming the government") and then approved by a simple majority (71 votes) in the Assembly.

== Administrative divisions ==
''Main articles: [[Districts of Albania]] and [[Counties of Albania]]''

Albania is divided into 12 ''qark'' (county or prefecture), which are further divided into 36 ''rrethe'' (districts).  The capital city, Tiranë, has a special status. The districts are:

== جغرافيه ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Albania]]''

[[دوتنه:Albania map.png|frame|Map of Albania]]

Albania consists of mostly [[hill]]y and [[mountain]]ous terrain, the highest mountain, Korab in the district of Dibra reaching up to 2,753 m. The country mostly has a continental [[climate]], with cold [[winter]]s and hot [[summer]]s.

Besides capital city [[Tirana]], with 800,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durrës]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkodër]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Korçë]]. In Albanian grammar a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: so both Tiranë and Tirana, Shkodër and Shkodra are used.

== اقتصاد ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Albania]]''

In Albania, half of the economically-active population still engaged in [[agriculture]] and a fifth works abroad.

The country has almost no exports, and imports most if its goods from Greece and Italy. Money for imports comes from financial aid and from the money that [[immigrant]]s working abroad - mostly in neighbouring Greece - bring to Albania. This is a good [[status quo]] business for both Greece and Italy. 

Albania's coastline on the Ionian Sea, near the Greek tourist island of [[Corfu]], is becoming increasingly popular with foreign visitors due to its relatively unspoilt nature and good beaches. However, the tourist industry is still in its infancy.

Growth was strong 2003-05 and inflation is not a problem.

GDP(purchasing power parity): 18.05 billion
Note: Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP. (2005 est.)

GDP (official exchange rate): 8.741 billion (2005 est.)

GDP (real growth rate): 6% (2005 est.)  

GDP- composition by sector: 
agriculture: 23.6%
industry: 20.5%
services: 55.9%  (2005 est.)

Exports: 708 million f.o.b. (2005 est.)

Imports: 2.473 billion f.o.b. (2005 est.)

Aid per Capita:  52 US$ 

External Debt:  1.41 billion (2003 est.) 

Defence Expenditure:  (n/a)  

Children in Labour Force:  1 % of children aged 10-14 work

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Albania]]''

Most of the population is ethnically Albanian (95% according to the [[CIA World Factbook]] Feb 2005), there is a [[Greece|Greek]] minority (3% of the population), this however could significally vary according to other sources, (note: in 1989, other estimates of the Greek population ranged from 1% (official Albanian statistics) to 12% (from a Greek organization) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/al.html#People]). Many ethnic Albanians also live in the bordering countries of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (around 1,850,000; of that, around 1,800,000 in [[Serbia]] (around 1,700,000 in its province called [[Kosovo]] (officially [[Kosovo and Metohia]]) only) and around 50,000 in [[Montenegro]]) and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (around 500,000). Since [[1991]], large numbers of Albanians have emigrated, both legally and illegally, to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]]. According to the Greek government, about 200,000 ethnic Greeks have moved to Greece from Albania since 1990, which likely accounts for most of Albania's Greek minority at the time of the fall of Communism.

The language is [[Albanian language|Albanian]], although [[Greek language|Greek]] is also spoken by the Greek minority in the southern regions of the country.

At the height of the Ottoman occupation, the majority of [[Albanians]] were mostly [[Muslim]] (70%), even though religion was prohibited during the communist era. The Albanian government proclaimed Albania the only officially atheistic country in the world. After the fall of the Communist Regime in 1989-1990 religions were reinstated. According to 1939 statistics, the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox]] (20%) and [[Roman Catholic Church]] (10%) would be the other main religions in Albania. Religious fanaticism has never been a serious problem, with people from different religions living in peace and even getting married although this was not considered to be an optimal solution.  20% of the total Muslim population is [[Bektashi]], people who follow a faith originating in the Turkish migrations into Turkey, and came to Albania through the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]. It has outwardly Shi'ite Islamic elements, but is really a Shamanic-Pantheistic faith.
