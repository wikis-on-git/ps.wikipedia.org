بوټپوهنه پخپله په ځان کې د بوټو په هکله ډېرې نورې زده کړې رانغاړي چې په دې کې د [[د بوټو اناتومي|بوټو جوړښت]]، د [[د سلول وده|برار او ودې]]، د [[توليد]]اتو، د [[مېټابوليزم]]، د [[مورفوجېنېسز|لويېدلو]] او د [[فيتوپېتالوژي|بوټو د ناروغيو]] په هکله زده کړې شاملې دي. 
The study of plants and botany began with tribal lore, used to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making botany one of the oldest sciences.  From this the scope of botany has increased to include the study of over 550,000 kinds or species of living organisms.


==Scope and importance of botany==
[[Image:Beli-hibiskus.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hibiscus]]]]As with other life forms in biology, plant life can be studied from different perspectives, from the [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] level through [[organelle]]s, [[cell biology|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], individuals, plant [[population]]s, and [[biodiversity|communities]] of plants. At each of these levels a botanist might be concerned with the classification ([[taxonomy]]), structure ([[Plant anatomy|anatomy]]), or function ([[Plant physiology|physiology]]) of plant life.

Historically, botany covers all organisms that were not considered to be [[animal]]s. Some of these "plant-like" organisms include [[fungi]] (studied in [[mycology]]), [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[viruses]] (studied in [[microbiology]]), and [[algae]] (studied in [[phycology]]). Most algae, fungi, and microbes are no longer considered to be in the plant kingdom. However, attention is still given to them by botanists, and bacteria, fungi, and algae are usually covered in introductory botany courses. 

The study of plants is important for a number of reasons. Plants are a fundamental part of [[life on earth]]. They  generate the [[oxygen]], [[food]], [[fibre]]s, fuel and medicine that allow higher life forms to exist. Plants also absorb [[carbon dioxide]], a significant [[greenhouse gas]], through [[photosynthesis]]. A good understanding of plants is crucial to the future of human societies as it allows us to:
* Feed the world
* Understand fundamental life processes
* Utilize medicine and materials
* Understand environmental changes

===Human nutrition===
[[Image:US long grain rice.jpg|right|thumb|Nearly all the food we eat comes (directly and indirectly) from plants like this American long grain [[rice]].]]
Virtually all food eaten comes from plants, either directly from [[staple food]]s and other [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]], or indirectly through [[livestock]] or other animals, which rely on plants for their nutrition. In other words, plants are at the base of nearly all [[food chain]]s, or what ecologists call the first [[trophic level]]. Understanding how plants produce the food we eat  is therefore important to be able to ''feed the world'' and provide [[food security]] for future generations, for example through [[plant breeding]]. Not all plants are beneficial to humans, some weeds are a considerable problem in [[agriculture]] and botany provides some of the basic science in order to understand how to minimize their impact. However, other weeds are pioneer plants which start an abused environment back on the road to rehabilitation, underlining that the term ''weed'' is a very relative concept, and that broadly defined a weed is simply a plant which is too successful.  [[Ethnobotany]] is the study of this and/or other relationships between plants and people.

[[Image:mendel.png|frame|left|[[Gregor Mendel]] laid the foundations of genetics from his studies of plants.]]

===د ژوند بنسټيزه کړنې===
Plants are convenient organisms in which fundamental life processes (like [[cell division]] and [[protein synthesis]] for example) can be studied, without the ethical dilemmas of studying animals or humans. The [[mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] were discovered in this way by [[Gregor Mendel]], who was studying the way [[peas|pea]] shape is inherited. What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany. Additionally, [[Barbara McClintock]] discovered '[[transposon|jumping genes']] by studying [[maize]]. These are a few examples that demonstrate how botanical research has an ongoing relevance to the understanding of fundamental biological processes.

===دارو درمل===
Many [[medication|medicinal]] and [[recreational drugs]], like [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[caffeine]], and [[nicotine]] come directly from the plant kingdom. [[Aspirin]], which originally came from the [[bark]] of [[willow]] trees, is just one example. There may be many [[drug discovery|novel cures for diseases]] provided by plants, waiting to be discovered. Popular [[stimulant]]s like [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[tobacco]], and [[tea]] also come from plants. Most [[alcoholic beverage]]s come from [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]] plants such as [[barley]] malt and [[grapes]].

Plants also provide us with many natural materials, such as [[cotton]], [[wood]], [[paper]], [[linen]], [[vegetable oil]]s, some types of [[rope]], and [[rubber]]. The production of [[silk]] would not be possible without the cultivation of the [[mulberry]] plant. [[Sugarcane]], [[rapeseed]], [[soy]] and other plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content have recently been put to use as sources of [[biofuel]]s, which are important alternatives to [[fossil fuel]]s, see [[biodiesel]].

===Environmental changes===
Plants can also help us understand changes in on our environment in many ways. 

*Understanding [[habitat destruction]] and [[endangered species|species extinction]] is dependent on an accurate and complete catalog of plant [[systematics]] and [[taxonomy]].
*Plant responses to [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] can help us monitor problems like the [[ozone depletion]]. 
*[[palynology|Analyzing pollen]] deposited by plants [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years ago]] can help scientists to reconstruct past climates and predict future ones, an essential part of [[climate change]] research.
*Recording and analyzing the timing of plant [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] are important parts of [[phenology]] used in climate-change research.
*[[Lichens]], which are sensitive to atmospheric conditions, have been extensively used as [[pollution]] indicators.

In many different ways, plants can act a little like the '[[canary|miners canary']], an ''early warning system'' alerting us to important changes in our environment. In addition to these practical and scientific reasons, plants are extremely valuable as recreation for millions of people who enjoy [[gardening]], [[horticulture|horticultural]] and [[herb|culinary]] uses of plants every day.

==تاريخ==
===Early botany (before 1945)===
[[Image:Botany.jpg|thumb|right|The traditional tools of a botanist.]]
Among the earliest of botanical works, written around [[300 B.C.]], are two large treatises by [[Theophrastus]]: ''On the History of Plants'' (''[[Historia Plantarum]]'') and ''On the Causes of Plants''. Together these books constitute the most important contribution to botanical science during antiquity and on into the Middle Ages. The Roman medical writer [[Dioscorides]] provides important evidence on Greek and Roman knowledge of medicinal plants.

In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]] in [[cork (material)|cork]], a short time later in living plant tissue. The German [[Leonhart Fuchs]], the Swiss [[Conrad von Gesner]], and the British authors [[Nicholas Culpeper]] and [[John Gerard]] published herbals that gave information on the medicinal uses of plants.

===Modern botany (since 1945)===
A considerable amount of new knowledge today is being generated from studying [[model organisms|model plants]] like ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. This weedy species in the mustard family was one of the first plants to have its [[genome]] sequenced. The sequencing of the [[rice]] (''Oryza sativa'') genome and a large international research community have made [[rice]] the de facto [[cereal]]/[[grass]]/[[monocot]] model. Another grass species, [[Brachypodium distachyon]] is also emerging as an experimental model for understanding the genetic, cellular and molecular biology of temperate grasses. Other commercially important staple foods like [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[millet]] and [[soybean]] are also having their genomes sequenced. Some of these are challenging to sequence because they have more than two [[haploid]] (n) sets of [[chromosome]]s, a condition known as [[polyploid]]y, common in the plant kingdom. The "Green Yeast" ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a single-celled, green [[alga]]) is another plant model organism that has been extensively studied and provided important insights into cell biology.

In 1998 the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogeny]] of flowering plants based on an analysis of [[DNA]] sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, major questions such which families represent the earliest branches in the genealogy of [[angiosperms]] are now understood.  Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.
