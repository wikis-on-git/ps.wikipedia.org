'''Grenada''' is an [[island nation]] in the southeastern [[Caribbean Sea]] including the southern [[Grenadines]]. Grenada is the second-smallest independent country in the [[Western Hemisphere]] (after [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]). It is located north of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and south of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Grenada]]''

The recorded history of Grenada begins in [[1498]], when [[Christopher Columbus]] first sighted the island and named it ''Conception''. At the time of settlement, the island was occupied either by [[Caribs|Island Caribs]] (Kalinago) or by their mainland cousins, the Kariña.  After a failed [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement attempt, the [[France|French]] 'purchased' the island from the indigenous people in [[1650]], which resulted in warfare with the Caribs of [[Dominica]] and [[St. Vincent]] who feared losing their trade routes to the mainland. The island was ceded to the [[United Kingdom]] in [[1763]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. Grenada was made a [[Crown Colony]] in [[1877]].

The island was a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] from [[1958]] to [[1962]]. In 1967 Grenada attained the position of "Associated State of the United Kingdom", which meant that Grenada was now responsible for her own internal affairs, and the UK was responsible for her defence and foreign affairs. Independence was granted in [[1974]] under the leadership of the then [[Eric Gairy|Premier Sir Eric Matthew Gairy]], who became the first [[Prime Minister of Grenada]].  Eric Gairy's government became increasingly authoritarian and dictatorial, prompting a ''[[coup d'état]]'' in March [[1979]] by the charismatic and popular left-wing leader of the [[New Jewel Movement]], [[Maurice Bishop]]. Bishop's failure to allow elections, coupled with his [[Marxist-Leninist]] socialism and cooperation with communist [[Cuba]] did not sit well with the country's neighbours, including [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], [[Dominica]] and the [[United States]]. A power struggle developed between Bishop and a majority of the ruling [[People's Revolutionary Government (PRG)]], including the co-founder of the NJM, [[Bernard Coard]]. This led to Bishop's house arrest; he and many others were eventually executed at Fort George on [[October 19]], [[1983]].

Six days later, the island [[Invasion of Grenada|was invaded]] by forces from the United States purportedly at the behest of [[Eugenia Charles|Dame Eugenia Charles]], of Dominica. Five other Caribbean nations participated with Dominica and the USA in the campaign, called ''Operation Urgent Fury''. Although the [[Governor-General]], [[Paul Scoon|Sir Paul Scoon]] later stated that he had requested the invasion, the governments of the United Kingdom and Trinidad and Tobago expressed anger at having not been consulted.  The forces quickly captured the ringleaders and hundreds of Cuban "advisors" (most of whom were labourers working on the construction of a major [[airport]] for the island, which the British completed a year later). A publicised tactical concern of the United States was the safe recovery of U.S. [[national]]s enrolled at [[St. George's University]]. However, it should be noted that the island of Grenada could have become a corner of a triangle comprised also of Cuba and Nicaragua, both also declared enemies of US interests at that time. These three countries could have militarily controlled the deep water passages, thereby controlling the movement of oil from [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (supplies then considered vital by US military planners).  But this supposed rationale was not even asserted as a justification of armed invasion.

17 members of the PRG and the PRA (army) were convicted via a Court set up and financed by the USA.  14 were sentenced to death, eventually commuted to life imprisonment after an international campaign.  Another 3 were sentenced to 45 years in prison.  These 17 have become known as the Grenada 17, and are the subject of an ongoing international campaign for their release.  In October 2003 Amnesty International issued a Report which stated that their arrest and trial had been a miscarriage of justice.  The 17 have protested their innocence consistently since 1983.  The campaign for justice for the 17 is the subject of a 60 minute documentary "Prisoners of the Cold War" (UK, 2006, www.silvercityfilms.co.uk), which explores the idea that the continued confinement of the 17 reflects the post-traumatic state of the island as a whole.  Hence that the islanders, as well as the 17, remain frozen as emotional "prisoners" of the Cold War.

In 2000-2002 much of the controversy of the late 1970s and early 1980s was once again brought into the public consciousness with the opening of the truth and reconciliation commission. The commission was chaired by a Catholic priest, [[Mark Haynes|Friar Mark Haynes]], and was tasked with uncovering injustices arising from the PRA, Bishop's regime, and before. It held a number of hearings around the country. The commission was formed, bizarrely, because of a school project. [[Robert Fanovich|Brother Robert Fanovich]], head of Presentation Brothers' College (PBC) in St. George's tasked some of his senior students with conducting a research project into the era and specifically into the fact that Maurice Bishop's body was never discovered. Their project attracted a great deal of attention, including from the [[Miami Herald]] and the final report was published in a book written by the boys called ''Big Sky, Little Bullet''. It also uncovered that there was still a lot of resentment in Grenadian society resulting from the era, and a feeling that there were many injustices still unaddressed. The commission began shortly after the boys concluded their project.

In [[2004]], the island after being hurricane free for 49 years, was directly hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]] ([[September 7]]). The [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 hurricane]] caused 90 percent of the homes to be damaged or destroyed. The following year, 2005, [[Hurricane Emily]] ([[July 14]]) struck the island, causing an estimated [[USD]] $110 million ([[East Caribbean Dollar|EC$]] 297 million) worth of damage. This was much less damage than Ivan had caused.

Grenada has recovered with remarkable speed, due to her climate and the resilience of her people combined with much needed help from her neighbours, and financing from the world at large. By December 2005, 96% of all hotel rooms were to be open for business and to have been upgraded in facilities and strengthened to an improved building code.  The agricultural industry and in particular the nutmeg industry suffered serious losses, but that event has begun changes in crop management and the [[nutmeg]] industry may be returning to its pre-Ivan position as a major supplier in the western world.

== Politics ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Grenada]]''

As a [[Commonwealth Realm]], [[Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is Queen of Grenada and Head of State. The Crown is represented by a [[List of Governors-General of Grenada|Governor-General]], who is currently [[Daniel Williams|Sir Daniel Williams]].  Day-to-day executive power lies with the Head of Government, the Prime Minister. Although appointed by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the largest faction in the Parliament.

The Parliament consists of a Senate (13 members) and a House of Representatives (15 members). The senators are appointed by the government and the opposition, while the representatives are elected by the population for 5-year terms. With 49.9% of the votes and 8 seats in the [[Grenada parliamentary election, 2003|2003 election]], the [[New National Party (Grenada)|New National Party]] remains the largest party in Grenada. The largest opposition party is the [[National Democratic Congress (Grenada)|National Democratic Congress]] with 45.1% of the votes and 7 seats.

Grenada is a full and participating member of both the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

== Parishes ==
''Main article: [[Parishes of Grenada]]''

Politically, Grenada is divided into six parishes:

* [[Saint Andrew Parish, Grenada|Saint Andrew]]
* [[Saint David Parish, Grenada|Saint David]]
* [[Saint George Parish, Grenada|Saint George]]
* [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|Saint John]]
* [[Saint Mark Parish, Grenada|Saint Mark]]
* [[Saint Patrick Parish, Grenada|Saint Patrick]]

[[Carriacou and Petit Martinique]], two of the [[Grenadines]] have the status of dependency.

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Grenada]]''

[[دوتنه:Gj-map.gif|right|Map of Grenada]]

The island Grenada itself is the largest island; smaller Grenadines are [[Carriacou]], [[Petit Martinique]], [[Rhonde Island]], [[Caille Island]], [[Diamond Island]], [[Large Island]], [[Saline Island]] and [[Frigate Island]]. Most of the population lives on Grenada itself, and major towns there include the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]] and [[Gouyave]]. Largest settlement on the other islands is [[Hillsborough, Grenada|Hillsborough]] on Carriacou.

The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin with extremely rich soil. Grenada's interior is very mountainous with Mount St. Catherine being the highest at 2,756 feet.  Several small [[river]]s with beautiful waterfalls flow into the sea from these mountains. The [[climate]] is tropical: hot and humid in the rainy season and cooled by the trade winds in the dry season.  Grenada being on the southern edge of the hurricane belt has suffered only 3 hurricanes in 50 years. Hurricane Janet passed over Grenada on 23 September 1955 with winds of 115 mph, causing severe damage. The most recent storms to hit have been Hurricane Ivan on [[September 7]], [[2004]] causing severe damage and 39 deaths and Hurricane Emily on [[July 14]], [[2005]] causing serious damge in Carriacou and in the north of Grenada which had been relatively lightly affected by hurricane Ivan.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Grenada]]''

Economic progress in fiscal reforms and prudent macroeconomic management have boosted annual growth to 5%-6% in [[1998]]-99; the increase in economic activity has been led by construction and trade. Tourist facilities are being expanded; [[tourism]] is the leading [[foreign exchange]] earner. Major short-term concerns are the rising fiscal deficit and the deterioration in the external account balance. Grenada shares a common [[central bank]] and a common [[currency]] (the [[East Caribbean Dollar]]) with seven other members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

[[دوتنه:NutmegGrenada-jhw.jpg|left|frame|Mace within nutmeg fruit]]Grenada is sometimes called '''spice island'''. [[Cinnamon]], [[cloves]], [[ginger]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], and [[nutmeg]] are important exports. There is a nutmeg on the nation's flag. 

The red lacy material in the photo is mace.  It is found between the nutmeg fruit and the nut itself.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Grenada]]''

About 80% of the population are descendants of the [[Africa]]n [[Slavery|slaves]] brought by the Europeans; no indigenous [[Carib]] and [[Arawak]] population survived the French purge at Sauteurs.  About 12% are descendants of the Indian indentured emigration to St. Lucia and Grenada which started in 1855 with the rest of a mixture of African, Indian, and European descent.

Grenada, like many of the Caribbean islands is subject to a large amount of migration, with a large amount of young people wanting to leave the island to seek life elsewhere. With less than 100,000 people living in Grenada, estimates and census data suggest that there are at least that number of Grenadian-born people in other parts of the Caribbean (such as Barbados and Trinidad) and at least that number again in 'first world' countries. Popular migration points for Grenadians further north include [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[London]] and [[Yorkshire]]. This means that probably around a third of those born in Grenada still live there.

The official language, [[English language|English]], is spoken by virtually everyone. Aside from a marginal community of Rastafarians living in Grenada, nearly all are Christians, about half of them [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]; [[Anglicanism]] is the largest [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination with Presbyterian and Seventh Day Adventist taking up the remainder.  Most Churches have demonination based schools but are open to all.  There is a small Muslim population mostly from old Iraqi immigrants who came many years ago and set up some merchant shops.

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Grenada]]''

Although [[France|French]] influence on culture is much less than in other [[Caribbean islands]], surnames and place names in French remain and some French architecture has survived from the [[1700s]]. Island culture is heavily influenced by the [[African]] roots of most of the Grenadians but [[India]]n influence is also seen with Dhal Puree, Goat and Chicken curry in the cuisine.

Foods aren't the only important aspect of Grenadian culture. Music, dance, and festivals are also extremely important. [[Soca]], [[calypso]], and [[reggae]] set the mood for Grenada's annual [[Carnival]] activities. The islanders' African heritage has also played an influential role in many aspects of Grenada's culture.
