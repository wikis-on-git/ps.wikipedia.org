The '''People's Republic of China''' ('''PRC'''; [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified Chinese]]: 中华人民共和国, [[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional Chinese]]: 中華人民共和國; [[pinyin]]: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó {{Audio|Zh-Zhonghua renmin gongheguo.ogg|listen}}), or '''[[چين]]''', is a [[state]] in [[East Asia]]. The PRC is home to over 1.3 billion people, which makes it the most populous country in the world.

Since its founding in [[1949]], the PRC has been led by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) under a [[Single-party state|one-party]] system. Though [[Constitution of the PRC|constitutionally]] a [[socialist state]], the PRC has extensively [[privatization|privatized]] its economy in the past three decades under "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]." Nonetheless, it retains significant political control over the remaining [[state-owned enterprise]]s and the [[bank]]ing sector. These [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] have succeeded in creating jobs and spurring economic growth, lifting much of the populace from poverty and leading to a growing Chinese [[Geopolitics|global]] influence in [[economics|economic]], [[Politics of China|political]], [[military]], [[science|scientific]], [[technology|technological]], and [[Culture of China|cultural]] affairs. 

In an ongoing dispute, the PRC [[political status of Taiwan|claims sovereignty over Taiwan]] and some neighboring islands, whose control was never relinquished by the [[Republic of China]]. The PRC asserts the Republic of China to be an illegitimate and supplanted entity and administratively categorizes [[Taiwan]] as a province of the PRC. The term "[[mainland China]]" is sometimes used to denote the area under the PRC's rule, usually excluding the two [[Special Administrative Region]]s, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. 

==Terminology==
The name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China as a positive term by the Communist Party as a political and social term contrasting China before 1949 (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, and sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC has also been known (mainly in the [[Cold War]] era), as '''Communist China''' and somewhat disparagingly as '''Red China''', to distinguish it from the ROC on Taiwan (once known as Nationalist China or Free China). In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sporting, "China" is often used to refer to mainland China to the exclusion of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

==History==
{{main articles|[[History of China]], [[History of the People's Republic of China]], and [[Timeline of Chinese history]]}}
After [[World War II]], the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Kuomintang]] ended in 1949 with the Communists in control of [[mainland China]] and the Kuomintang in control of [[Taiwan]] and some outlying islands of [[Fujian]]. On [[October 1]], [[1949]], [[Mao Zedong]] emphatically declared the People's Republic of China, establishing a [[communist state]], and proclaiming "the Chinese people have stood up."[[Image:China, Mao (2).jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Mao Zedong]] declares the founding of the PRC in 1949]] <!-- This picture should really go in the history section but the infobox is preventing it from doing so -->

Supporters of the Maoist Era claim that under Mao, China's unity and [[sovereignty]] was assured for the first time in a century, and there was development of [[infrastructure]], [[industry]], [[healthcare]], and [[education]], which raised [[standard of living]] for the average Chinese. They also believe that [[Political_campaign|campaign]]s such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]] were essential in jumpstarting China's development and purifying its culture. More nuanced arguments claim that though the consequences of both these campaigns were economically and humanly disastrous, they left behind a "clean slate" on which later economic progress could be built. Supporters may also doubt statistics or accounts given for death tolls or other damages incurred by Mao's campaigns. Some, including Mao at the time, attributed the high death toll to [[natural disaster]]s; still others doubt this figure entirely, or claim that many more people died due to famine or other consequences of political chaos during the rule of [[Chiang Kai-Shek]].

Critics of Mao's [[regime]] assert that Mao's administration imposed strict controls over everyday life, and believe that campaigns such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Cultural Revolution]] contributed to or caused millions of deaths, incurred severe economic costs, and damaged China's [[cultural heritage]]. The [[Great Leap Forward]] in particular preceded a massive [[famine]] in China which, according to numbers guessed by credible Western and Eastern sources[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm], 20–30 million people died; most Western and many Chinese analysts attribute this to the [[Great Leap Forward]].

Following the dramatic economic failures of the early 1960s, Mao stepped down from his position as chairman of the People's Republic. The National People's Congress elected [[Liu Shaoqi]] as Mao's successor. Mao remained head of the Party but was removed from day to day management of economic affairs which came under the control of a more moderate leadership  under the dominant influence of [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and others who initiated economic reforms.

In 1966, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which is viewed by his opponents (including both Western analysts and many Chinese people who were youth at the time) as a strike back at his rivals by mobilizing the youth of the country in support of his thought and purging the moderate leadership, but was viewed by his supporters as an experiment in direct [[democracy]] and a genuine attempt at purging Chinese society of [[political corruption|corruption]] and other negative influences. Mao's [[personality cult]] at the time and the relatively [[hierarchical|hierarchy]], top-down structure of the "[[Red Guard]]" tend to contradict this interpretation, however, as did the economic reconstruction needed in China after these events. Extreme disorder followed but gradually under the leadership of [[Zhou Enlai]] moderate forces regained influence.

After Mao's death, [[Deng Xiaoping]], seen as the leader of the economic reformists, succeeded in winning the power struggle, and Mao's widow, [[Jiang Qing]] and her associates, the [[Gang of Four]], who had assumed control of the country, were arrested and put on trial. Since then, the government has gradually and greatly loosened governmental control over people's personal lives, and began transitioning China's planned economy into a [[mixed economy]]. Supporters of the economic reforms point to the rapid development of the [[consumer]] and [[export]] sectors of the economy, the creation of an urban [[middle class]] that now constitutes 15% of the population, higher living standards (which is shown via dramatic increases in [[GDP per capita]], consumer spending, [[life expectancy]], [[literacy rate]], and total grain output) and a much wider range of personal rights and freedoms for average Chinese as evidence of the success of the reforms. Critics of the economic reforms claim that the reforms have caused [[wealth disparity]], [[environmental pollution]], rampant [[Political corruption|corruption]], widespread [[unemployment]] associated with layoffs at inefficient [[state-owned enterprise]]s, and has introduced often unwelcome cultural influences. Consequently they believe that China's culture has been corrupted, the poor have been reduced to a hopeless abject underclass, and that the social stability is threatened.  They are also of the opinion that various political reforms, such as moves towards popular elections, have been unfairly nipped in the bud.  Regardless of either view, today, the public perception of Mao has improved dramatically, and images of Mao and Mao related objects have become fashionable. [[Image:Shanghai_-_Nanjing_Road.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Nanjing Road, Shanghai|Nanjing Road]] (&#21335;&#20140;&#36335;), one of the world's busiest shopping streets.]]<!-- something to represent the transformation to capitalism -->

Despite these concessions to capitalism, the Communist Party of China remains in control and has maintained policies against groups which it feels are threats, such as [[Falun Gong]] and the separatist movement in [[Tibet]]. Supporters of these policies claim that these policies safeguard stability in a society that is torn apart by class differences and rivalries, has no tradition of civil participation, and limited rule of law. Opponents of these policies claim that these policies severely violate norms of [[human rights]] that the international community recognizes, and further claim that this results in a [[police state]], which creates an atmosphere of fear and ignorance.

In 1989, the death of pro-reform official [[Hu Yaobang]] led to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others held protests in Beijing's [[Tiananmen Square]] and elsewhere to campaign for democratic reform and freedom. The protests ended on [[June 3]] - [[June 4]] when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops entered the square, killing hundreds. The event brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the PRC government. The PRC government itself has since remained relatively silent on the issue, though it has also defended it by saying that it was necessary for the continued stability of the country.

The People's Republic of China adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on [[December 4]], [[1982]].

==Politics==
[[Image:National People's Congress.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Great Hall of the People]], where the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), highest legistlative body, of China convenes.]]
{{main|Politics of the People's Republic of China}}<!-- This section is on the politics of [[Mainland China]] -->
In the [[technical terminology]] of [[political science]] the PRC was a [[communist state]] for much of the 20th century, and is still considered a communist [[state]] by many, though not all [[List of political scientists|political scientist]]s agree. Attempts to characterize the nature of China's political [[structure]] into a single, simple category are typically seen as lacking sufficient depth to be satisfactory. A major reason for this is China's political history:  for over two thousand years, prior to 1949, the state had been ruled by some form of [[Chinese Empire|centralized imperial monarchy]] with strong [[Confucian]] influences, which have left significant traces on subsequent political and social structures. This was followed by a chaotic succession of largely [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] governments as well as [[warlord]]-[[occupation|held]] administration since the first [[Chinese Revolution]] of 1912.

The PRC [[regime]] has variously been described as [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[communism|communist]], [[socialism|socialist]] and various combinations of those terms. It has also been described as a [[Communist state|communist government]]. This may be called [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] by more left-leaning communists. It appears China is slowly becoming [[Capitalism|capitalist]] in its economic system. China recently released an official statement on its political structure, upholding the notion that the state should be ruled by democratic means. Personal freedoms have grown considerably since the early days of Communist rule. However, heavy restrictions remain in some areas, most notably [[Internet censorship in mainland China|internet censorship]] and [[freedom of the press]].

The government of the PRC is controlled by the [[Communist Party of China|China Communist Party]] (CPC). There are some other political parties in PRC, called "democratic parties". However they are very closely associated with the CPC.  These minor parties participate in the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies. While there have been some moves toward political liberalization, in that open [[contested election]]s are now held at the village level and legislatures have shown some assertiveness from time to time, the party retains effective control over governmental appointments. While the state uses authoritarian methods to deal with challenges to its rule, it simultaneously attempts to reduce dissent by improving the economy, allowing expression of personal grievances, and giving lenient treatment to persons expressing dissent whom the regime does not believe are organizers.

[[Censorship]] of political speech and information is openly and routinely used to protect what the government claims to be national security interests, including [[Internet censorship in China|internet censorship]]. The government has a policy of suppressing any protests and organizations that it considers a threat to its power, as was the case after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]]. However, there are limits to the repression that the Party is willing or able to achieve. The media have become increasingly active in publicizing social problems and exposing corruption and inefficiency at lower levels of government, although recently the PRC has tended to increase crackdowns on reporters. The Party has also been rather unsuccessful at controlling information, and in some cases has had to change policies in response to public outrage. Although organized opposition against the Party is not tolerated, demonstrations over local issues are frequent and increasingly tolerated.

The support that the Communist Party of China has among the Chinese population is unclear, as there are no national elections, and private conversations and anecdotal information often reveal conflicting views. Many in China appear to appreciate the role that the government plays in maintaining social stability, which has allowed the economy to grow without interruption. Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor in the PRC, and the growing discontent with widespread corruption within the leadership and officials.

===Human rights debates===
''Main article [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China]]''

The PRC is sometimes under criticism from Western governments and [[NGO]]s concerning allegations of lengthy [[detention without trial]], forced confessions, [[torture]], and [[mistreatment of prisoners]] as well as allegations of restrictions on freedoms of [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of the press|the press]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], and [[workers' rights]], as being violations of their definition of human rights. They argue these alleged violations stem from the PRC government's intolerance of dissent and the inadequacy of legal safeguards for individual political rights.

The PRC government argues that the notion of human rights should include economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity. It views the rise in the standard of living of the Chinese people as an indicator of improvement of the human rights situation.

==Political Divisions==
{{main|Political divisions of China}}
The People's Republic of China has administrative control over 22 provinces (省); the government of the People's Republic of China considers [[Taiwan Province|Táiwān]] (台湾), which is actually controlled by the [[Republic of China]], to be its 23rd province. (See [[Political status of Taiwan]] for more information.) Apart from provinces there are 5 autonomous regions (自治区) containing concentrations of several minorities; 4 municipalities (直辖市) for China's largest cities and 2 [[Special Administrative Region]]s (SAR) (特别行政区), which are governed by the PRC but enjoy considerable autonomy.

The 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 municipalities can be collectively referred to as "[[mainland China]]", a term which usually excludes Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.

{{main|Geography of China}}
The PRC is the largest [[country]] in [[area]] in [[East Asia]] (excluding Russia) and the [http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1018965313021 third largest] in the world by land-and-sea area. (However, the [[United States of America]] disputes this and instead believes itself to be the [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html third largest].) It borders 14 nations (counted clockwise from south): [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] (commonly known as Burma), [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]]{{ref|disp}}, [[افغانستان]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[روسيه]], [[Mongolia]] and [[North Korea]].

The PRC contains a large variety of landscapes. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], are found extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]]; the [[shore]] of the [[South China Sea]] is more mountainous and southern China is dominated by hill country and lower mountain ranges. In the central-east are found the [[river delta|delta]]s of China's two major rivers, the [[Huang He]] and [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang). Other major rivers include the [[Xijiang River]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur]]. 

To the west, major mountain ranges, notably the [[Himalaya]] with China's highest point [[Mount Everest]], and high plateaus feature among the more arid landscape of [[desert]]s such as the [[Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. 

Due to a prolonged [[drought]] and poor agricultural practices [[dust storm|dust storms]] have become usual in the spring in China. According to China's Environmental Protection Agency, the Gobi Desert has been expanding "like a tsunami" and is a major source of dust storms which affect [[Mainland China]] and other parts of northeast Asia such as [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].  Dust from the northern plains has been tracked to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the [[United States]].  River management (human waste dumping, factory pollution, and water extraction for irrigation and drinking) and dust erosion are problems affecting other countries that have become recent important concerns for relations between China and its neighboring countries.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China}}
The People's Republic of China maintains diplomatic relations with most countries in the world, but makes acknowledging its claim to [[Taiwan]] and severing any official ties with the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) government a prerequisite for diplomatic exchanges. It actively opposes foreign travels by current and former political officials of Taiwan, such as [[Lee Teng-hui]] and [[Chen Shui-bian]], and other persons it sees politically dangerous, such as [[Tenzin Gyatso]] (considering [[Tibet]]) and [[Li Hongzhi]] (considering [[Falun Gong]]).

[[Image:Clinton and jiang.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Bill Clinton]].]]

In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative for "China" in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]; it is also considered a founding member although the PRC was not in control at the founding of the UN. (See [[China and the United Nations]])

It was for a time a member and leader of the   [[Non-Aligned Movement]], but now is an observer. Much of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful rise]].

[[Sino-Japanese relations]] have been strained several times in the past few decades by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its past [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] and violations to Chinese satisfaction, most notable among which is the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]]. Recent incidents with the United States include the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999, allegedly involved in nuclear secrets espionage reported in the [[Cox Report]], as well as the [[U.S.-China spy plane incident]] in April 2001.

Some NGOs and Western governments have criticized China for alleged human rights abuses and its foreign relations with many Western Nations suffered following the [[Tiananmen Square]] Incident in 1989.

In addition to Taiwan, China is involved in several other territorial disputes. The PRC makes all of these claims on [[irredentism|irredentist]] grounds, while the opposing claimants tend towards viewing irredentism as a baseless ideology or view the PRC as being motivated by resources, military considerations, or nationalism considerations:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* With [[India]]:
** [[Aksai Chin]], administered by China, officially claimed by [[India]], but India has not included it in any discussion about a settlement to the Kashmir dispute, effectively ceding it to China.
** [[Arunachal Pradesh]] / South Tibet, administered by India, claimed by China

{{col-break}}
* Over islands on the [[East China Sea]] or [[South China Sea]]:
** [[Paracel Islands]], administered by China, claimed by [[Vietnam]] and the [[Republic of China|ROC]]
** [[Spratly Islands]]: the People’s Republic of China, the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), and [[Vietnam]] each claim sovereignty over the entire group, while [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Brunei]] claim parts of the group.
** Diaoyu Islands/[[Senkaku Islands]], administered by [[Japan]], claimed by the PRC and the [[Republic of China|ROC]]
{{col-end}}

In 2004, Russia agreed to transfer [[Yinlong Island]] as well as one half of [[Heixiazi Island]] to China, ending a long-standing border dispute between Russia and China. Both islands are found at the confluence of the [[Amur]] and [[Ussuri]] Rivers, and were until then administered by Russia and claimed by China. The event was meant to foster feelings of reconciliation and cooperation between the two countries by their leaders, but it has also sparked different degrees of discontents on both sides. The transfer has been ratified by both the Chinese [[National People's Congress]] and the Russian [[State Duma]] but has yet to be carried out to date.

Outside official opinion, it is popular for nationalists to make [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims to [[Mongolia]], [[Tuva]] and [[Outer Manchuria]], as well as (less commonly) the [[Ryukyu Islands]], [[Bhutan]], the [[Hukawng Valley]] in northern [[Myanmar]], and [[Central Asia]] southeast of [[Lake Balkhash]].
{{see also|Political status of Taiwan}}

In 1997, the [[ASEAN]] member nations and the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the [[ASEAN Plus Three]] meetings. In 2005 the ASEAN plus Three countries together with [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] held the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS).

==Military==
{{main|People's Liberation Army}}
[[Image:YuanWang2c.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[Yuan Wang-class]] Aerospace Tracking Ship]]

The PRC maintains a military consisting of its [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|army]], [[People's Liberation Army Navy|navy]], [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|air force]], and strategic [[People's Liberation Army#Nuclear weapons|nuclear]] forces. Its 2.25 million strong force makes it the largest military in the world, in terms of number of troops. The People's Liberation Army's official budget for 2005 is $30 billion, possibly excluding foreign weapons purchases, military-related research and development and the paramilitary [[People's Armed Police]] and other expenses.  Even the highest estimates set the military spending at considerably less than that of the [[United States]].

The PRC, despite possession of [[nuclear weapon]]s and delivery systems, is widely seen both within and outside of China as having only limited ability to project military power beyond its borders and is not generally considered to be a true [[superpower]], although it is widely seen as a major [[regional power]]. This is due to the limited effectiveness of its navy, such as lacking aircraft carriers, and air-force, which is large but generally considered obsolete by Western standards. 

The PRC continues to make efforts to modernize its military. It has purchased state-of-the-art fighter jets from Russia, such as [[Su-27]]s and [[Su-30]]s, and has produced its own relatively modern fighters, specifically the [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]]. It has also acquired Russian [[SA-10 Grumble|S-300]] Surface-to-Air missile systems, which are widely considered to be among the best aircraft-intercepting systems in the world. The PRC's armoured and rapid-reaction forces have been updated with enhanced electronics and targeting capabilities. In recent years, much attention has been focused on building a navy with blue-water capability.

==Economy==
[[Image:Porcelain_Workshop,_Jingdezhen,_Jiangxi,_China.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Entry into the global economy has given vast amounts of people opportunities to rise economically.]]
{{main|Economy of the People's Republic of China}}

Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been [[Chinese economic reform|reforming the economy]] from a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style centrally planned economy to a more market-oriented economy but still within a rigid political framework of Communist Party control. To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in [[agriculture]] in place of the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in [[industry]], permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light [[manufacturing]], and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and investment. Price controls were also relaxed.  This has resulted in mainland China's shift from a [[planned economy|command economy]] to a [[mixed economy]] with both communist and capitalist tendencies.

The government has tended to not emphasize equality as when it first began and instead emphasized raising personal income and consumption and introducing new management systems to help increase productivity. The government also has focused on foreign trade as a major vehicle for economic growth, for which purpose it set up 5 [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ: Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, Hainan Province) where investment laws are relaxed in order to attract foreign capital. The result has been a 6-fold increase of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] since 1978. In 2005, with its 1.3 billion people and a GDP of $6200 per capita ([[PPP|Purchasing Power Parity]])  [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/ch.html], the PRC became the sixth largest economy in the world by exchange rate [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-12/20/content_504997.htm] and third largest in the world after the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] by purchasing power parity. The average annual income of a Chinese worker is about $1,500. Chinese economic development is among the fastest in the world, about 8-9% per year according to Chinese government statistics. China is now a member of the [[World Trade Organization]].

Mainland China has a reputation as being a low-cost manufacturer, particularly due to its abundant non-unionised inexpensive labor. An unskilled worker at a Chinese factory in the rural area costs a company under $1/hour, however, the prices of goods and services in China are lower than in more developed countries. Furthermore, many Chinese workers do not join [[trade union]]s. Employers may find this helpful as [[labor relations]] are different in most other parts of the world. A possible reason for this could be [[work ethics]], or it is also conceivable it is driven by a fear that unions will be abused by the [[Communist Party of China]] to identify [[dissidents]]. (See [[list of Chinese dissidents]].) {{China regional economic strategies}}

Another aspect of the Chinese economy that is often overlooked is the low cost of non labor inputs. This is due in part to an overly competitive environment with many producers and a general tendency towards an oversupply and low prices. There is also the continued existence of price controls and supply guarantees left over from the former Soviet style command economy. As State owned enterprises continue to be dismantled and workers shift to higher productivity sectors, this deflationary effect will continue to put pressure on prices in the economy.  

Preferential tax incentives are also given as a direct fiscal incentive to manufacture in China, whether for export or for the local market of 1.3 billion. China is attempting to harmonize the system of taxes and duties it imposes on enterprises, domestic and foreign alike. As a result, preferential tax and duty policies that benefit exporters in special economic zones and coastal cities have been targeted for revision. 

China's high growth in the global markets has caused notable disputes, especially the trade imbalance with the United States. The discrepancy is largely attributed to the fact that Chinese corporations can produce many products desired in the US far more cheaply than other parts of Asia or Latin America, and expensive products produced in America are in large part uncompetitive compared to European or Asian goods. Another factor cited by some people was the unfavorable [[exchange rate]] between the [[Renminbi|Chinese yuan]] and the [[United States dollar]] to which it used to be [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]]. On [[July 21]], [[2005]] the [[People's Bank of China]] announced that it would move to a floating peg ([[managed float]]), allowing its currency to move against the United States dollar by 0.3% a day. The yuan's trading band against other currencies is 3% a day. Many high tech American companies have difficulty exporting to China due to federal government restrictions. This may also have contributed to the widening trade gap between the 2 countries. With the elimination of clothing quotas, China stands to take over a large chunk of the worldwide textile industry. [http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/26/business/worldbusiness/26CHIN.html?th] [http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/02/business/02CHIN.html?th]

In 2003, China's GDP in terms of [[purchasing power parity]] reached $6.4 trillion, becoming the [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html second-largest in the world]. Using conventional measurements, China's GDP is expected to become [http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,7369,1666876,00.html the world's fourth-largest in 2005]. With its large population this still gives an average GNP per person of only an estimated $5,000, about 1/7th that of the United States. The officially reported growth rate for 2003 was 9.1%.

The disparity in wealth between the coastal strip and the remainder of the country remains wide. To counter this potentially destabilizing problem, the government has initiated the [[China Western Development]] strategy (2000), the [[Revitalize Northeast China]] initiative (2003), and the [[Rise of Central China]] policy (2004), which are all aimed at helping the interior of China to catch up.
The map on the right shows the economic regions of [[Mainland China]] covered under these strategies.

{{main articles|[[Transportation in the People's Republic of China]], [[Transportation in Hong Kong]], and [[Transportation in Macau]]}}

Transportation in the mainland of the People's Republic of China has improved remarkably starting in the late 1990s as part of a government effort to link the entire nation through a series of expressways known as the [[National Trunk Highway System]]. Private car ownership is increasing but remains uncommon, in large part due to government policies designed to make car ownership expensive through the use of taxes and toll roads.

Air travel has increased considerably, although remains out of reach for most ordinary mainland Chinese. Long distance transportation for most mainland Chinese is still dominated by the railways and bus systems.

Cities are increasingly building underground or light rail systems, such as in [[Shanghai]]. [[Hong Kong]] has one of the most modern transport systems in the world.

{{main|Culture of China}}

China's traditional values were derived from the orthodox version of [[Confucianism]]/[[conservatism]], which was taught in schools and was even part of [[imperial civil service examinations]]. However, the term Confucianism is somewhat problematic in that the system of thought which reached its high-water mark in Qing Dynasty imperial China was in fact composed of several strains of thought, including [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], which in many ways departed from the original spirit of Confucianism; indeed by the height of imperial China, the right of the individual ethical conscience and the right to criticise tyrannical governments and demand change had largely been prohibited by "orthodox" thinkers. Currently, there are neo-Confucians who believe that contrary to that line of thought, democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian "Asian values".  See [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccba/cear/issues/fall97/graphics/special/debary/debary.htm]

The leaders who directed the efforts to change Chinese society after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 were raised in the old society and had been marked with its values. PRC leaders sought to change some traditional aspects, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and Confucian education, while preserving others, such as the family structure. Some observers believe that the Communist period following 1949 is very much in continuity with traditional [[Chinese history]], rather than revolutionary.

On the other hand, some observers believe that the Communist period following 1949 has fundamentally altered or damaged the foundations of Chinese culture. At various times in the history of the PRC, many aspects of traditional Chinese culture were labeled 'regressive and harmful' or 'vestiges of feudalism' by the regime or by prominent movements (e.g. by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]]), such as [[Confucianism]], traditional art, literature, and performing arts; for example, [[Beijing opera]] was "reformed" to conform to communist propaganda. The brutality of the Cultural Revolution itself has also been described as destructive to China's traditional moral values. The institution of the [[Simplified Chinese]] orthography reform is controversial as well, with some considering it harmless, and others viewing it as an assault on Chinese culture. However, China has since moved away from attempting to reform all of its traditional art forms.  As time has progressed, the PRC government has accepted much of traditional Chinese culture as an integral part of Chinese society; current Chinese national policy often lauds these as important achievements of the Chinese civilization and emphasizes them as being integral to the formation of Chinese national identity. The PRC has also promoted feelings of nationalism in recent years, regarded by some observers as an effort to provide legitimacy for its rule.

{{main|Sports in China}}

===Popular Sports===
China has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world, spanning the course of several millennia. The following is a list of some of the predominant sports in the PRC.

'''Table Tennis''' - ''Ping pang qiu'' ( 乒乓球) is the official name for [[ping pong]] or [[table tennis]] in China. China has consistently been one of the best ping pong playing nations in the world and is home to what many consider to be the greatest player of all time, [[Deng Yaping]].

<!--FIFA, http://www.fifa.com/en/history/index/0,1284,103480,00.html?articleid=103480-->
'''Soccer''' - [[Soccer]] (or football) is another widely popular sport in China. A form of soccer was played in China some 10,000 years ago. It achieved extreme popularity around 2,000 years ago when the game transformed from a more hands-on  style of play to being played primarily by kicking. The earliest form of soccer was known as 'caju', literally meaning 'to kick ball', played with a leather ball full of hair. Today, international soccer is seeing a resurgence in popularity. However, due to the scarcity of large, open areas, it remains mostly a [[spectator sport]] in the urban areas.

'''Basketball''' - Because of the low infrastructure requirement, [[basketball]] is a popular sport participated in by young people, especially young men and boys. The [[United States of America|American]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] games have a huge fan base in China, partly because of the participation of [[Yao Ming]], who plays for the [[Houston Rockets]].

'''Golf''' - [[Golf]] is an emerging game in China, and is seen by some as a status symbol. Several retired [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] leaders are known to be keen golfers. A form of golf, involving hitting balls into holes in the ground with a stick, had been played in China for at least 700 years. 

'''Martial Arts''' - Hundreds of different styles of Chinese martial arts, or ''[[Wushu]]'', have developed over the past two thousand years, many distinctive styles with their own sets of techniques and ideas. hundreds of different styles and schools of Wushu still exist in China, but generally they can be divided into a few distinct branches, including Northern and Southern [[Shaolin]]-style Wushu, as well as Buddhist, Daoist and Muslim styles. For more information see [[Chinese martial arts]].

'''Traditional Sports''' - Many traditional sports are still played. In [[Inner Mongolia]] traditional sports such as [[Mongolian-style wrestling]] and [[horse racing]] are popular. In [[Tibet]], archery and equestrian sports are a part of traditional festivals. [[Dragon boat racing]] occurs during the [[Duan Wu festival]].

=== Performance at international games ===
China has also done well in recent [[Olympic Games]], particularly the summer games, in 2004 China was second in the gold medal tally, and third in total medals with 63 (32 gold, 17 silver and 14 bronze). For details see [[China at the Olympics]]. [[Beijing]] is set to host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. In the [[Winter Olympics]], China has performed well in speed skating and figure skating. The [[Chinese national women's ice hockey team]] is highly ranked in world competitions.

==Science and technology==
[[Image:China (172).jpg|right|thumb|150px|Launch of the [[Long March rocket]].]]
{{main|Science and technology in China}}

After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], China started to develop its own indigenous nuclear deterrent and delivery systems. A natural outgrowth of this was a satellite launching program. This culminated in 1970 with the launching of [[Dong Fang Hong I]], the first Chinese satellite. This made the PRC the fifth nation to independently launch a satellite.

In 1992 the current "[[Project 921]]" manned spaceflight program was authorized. On [[19 November]] [[1999]], the unmanned ''[[Shenzhou 1]]'' was launched, the first test flight of the program. After three more tests, ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' was launched on [[October 15]], [[2003]], using a [[Long March rocket|Long March 2F rocket]] and carrying [[Yang Liwei]], making the PRC the third country to put a human being into [[outer space|space]] through its own endeavors. The second mission, ''[[Shenzhou 6]]'' launched [[12 October]] [[2005]]. Some see [[Space program of China|China's space program]] as a response to the [[United States Air Force]]'s efforts to militarize space.

China is actively developing in fields such as [[biotechnology]], [[biomedicine]], [[information technology]], [[urban infrastructure]] and [[electronics]].
