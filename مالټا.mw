}}
'''Malta''', officially the '''Republic of Malta''', is a small and densely populated [[island nation]] consisting of an [[archipelago]] of [[Maltese islands|seven islands]] in the middle of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Malta lies directly south of [[Sicily]], east of [[تونېس]] and north of [[ليبيا]]. The country's official languages are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] is the most common religion. The strategically located islands constituting the Maltese nation have been ruled by various powers and fought over for centuries. Malta has been a member state of the [[European Union]] since [[May 1]] [[2004]]. It is currently the smallest [[European Union]] country in both population and area. Malta is the only nation in the world whose [[Flags and symbols of Malta|flags]] bear a decoration awarded by a foreign country, the British [[George Cross]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Malta}}
Malta has been inhabited since around [[5200 BC]]. A significant prehistoric [[Neolithic]] culture marked by [[Megalithic]] structures existed on the islands during its pre-history, predating the [[Pyramids of Giza]] by a millennium. [[Phoenicians]] colonized the islands around [[1000 BC]], using them as an outpost from which they expanded sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean.
[[دوتنه:Malta_18_Hagar_Qim.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ħaġar Qim]] Temples, [[Qrendi]], Malta]]

The islands later came under the control of [[Carthage]] ([[400 BC]]) and then of [[Roman Republic|Rome]] ([[218 BC]]). The islands prospered under Roman rule, during which time they were considered a [[Municipium]] and a Foederata [[Civitas]]. Many Roman antiquities still exist, testifying to the close link between the Maltese inhabitants and the people of Rome. In [[Anno Domini|AD]] 60, the islands were visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], who is said to have been shipwrecked on the shores of the aptly-named "[[St. Paul's Bay|Saint Paul's Bay]]".   

After a period of [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] rule ([[4th century|4th]] to [[9th century]]) and a probable sack by the [[Vandals]], the islands were conquered by the [[Arab]]s in AD 870. The Arabs, who generally tolerated the population's Christianity, introduced the cultivation of  citrus fruits and cotton, irrigation systems, and most notably, the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] language, which the Maltese population adopted as their mother tongue. Arab influence can be seen most prominently in the modern [[Maltese language]], which also contains traces of Romance influence, and is written in a variety of the [[Latin alphabet]].

The period of Arab rule lasted until 1091, when the islands were taken by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Normans]]. Subsequent rulers included the [[Anjou|Angevine]], the [[Hohenstaufen]], and the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] (1283). The [[Maltese nobility]] was established during this period; some of it dating back to 1400. About 32 noble titles remain in use today, of which the oldest is "Barons of Djar il Bniet and Buqana". 

In 1530, the islands were given by [[Spain]] to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]] in perpetual lease. (The [[Kingdom of Aragon]] had owned the islands as part of their Mediterranean empire for some time). These knights, a military religious order now known as the "[[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]", had been driven out of [[Rhodes]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1522. They withstood a full-blown [[Siege of Malta (1565)|siege by the Ottoman Turks]] in 1565. The Turks, at that time, were considered to be the greatest non-European military power. After this they decided to increase the [[fortification]]s, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of [[Valletta]], named after [[Jean Parisot de la Valette]], was built.

Their reign ended when Malta was captured by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] en route to his expedition of [[Egypt]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. As a ruse, Napoleon asked for safe harbour to resupply his ships, and then turned his guns against his hosts once safely inside Valetta.  [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] capitulated, and Napoleon stayed in Malta for a few days, during which he systematically looted the movable assets of the Order, and established an administration controlled by his nominees.  He then sailed for Egypt, leaving a substantial garrison in Malta.  The occupying French forces were unpopular, however, due particularly to their negative attitude towards religion. The Maltese rebelled against them, and the French were forced behind the fortifications. Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], sent munitions and aid to the rebels. Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|her navy]], which instigated a blockade of the islands. The isolated French forces, under General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]], surrendered in 1800, and the island became a British [[protectorate]], being presented by several Maltese leaders to Sir [[Alexander Ball]].   

[[دوتنه:Malta04.jpg|thumb|200px|Fortifications of Malta harbor.]]
In 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], Malta officially became a part of the [[British Empire]], and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. Malta's proximity to the [[Suez Canal]] proved to be its main asset during these years, and it was considered to be a most important stop on the way to [[India]]. In the 1930s, due to Malta's cultural and geographical proximity to Italy, the British Mediterranean Fleet was moved to [[Alexandria]]. Malta played an important role during [[World War II]], owing to its vicinity to [[Axis Powers|Axis]] shipping lanes. The bravery of the Maltese people in their long struggle against enemy attack led to them being awarded the [[George Cross]] on [[15 April]] [[1942]], now included in the corner of the [[Flag of Malta]].   

After the war, and after a short period of political instability due to the [[Malta Labour Party]]'s unsuccessful attempt at [[History of Malta#Attempted Integration with the United Kingdom|'Integration with Britain']], Malta was granted independence on [[September 21]], [[1964]] ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]). Under its 1964 [[constitution]], Malta initially retained Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]], with a [[Governor-General]] exercising [[executive (government)|executive]] authority on her behalf. On [[December 13]], [[1974]] ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]), however, it became a [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Malta|President]] as [[head of state]]. A defence agreement signed soon after independence (and re-negotiated in 1972) expired on [[March 31]], [[1979]] ([[Freedom Day (Malta)|Freedom Day]]) when the British military forces were withdrawn. Malta joined the [[European Union]] on [[May 1]], [[2004]]. It intends to join the [[Eurozone]] in 2008.

[[دوتنه:Edward_Fenech_Adami.jpg|thumb|220px|Dr. [[Edward Fenech Adami]] has been the President of Malta since 2004.]]
Malta is a [[republic]] enjoying [[representative democracy]], whose [[parliamentary system]] and [[public administration]] is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system]]. The [[unicameral]] [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]], known in Maltese as ''il-Kamra tad-Deputati'', is elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the [[President]] on advice of the [[Prime Minister]]. The House of Representatives is made up of 65 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The [[Constitution]] of Malta provides that the President appoint as Prime Minister the member of the House who is best able to command a (governing) majority in the House.

The [[President of Malta|President of the Republic]] is elected every five years by the House of Representatives.  The role of the president as head of state is largely ceremonial.

The main political parties are the [[Partit Nazzjonalista|Nationalist Party]], which is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party, and the [[Malta Labour Party]], which is a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party. 

The Nationalist Party is currently at the helm of the government, the Prime Minister being [[Lawrence Gonzi|Dr. Lawrence Gonzi]]. The Malta Labour Party, led by [[Alfred Sant|Dr. Alfred Sant]], is in the opposition.

There are several other parties that have no parliamentary seats: 
* [[Democratic Alternative (Malta)|Alternattiva Demokratika]], which is a [[Green Party]]. 
* [[Imperium Europa]], led by [[Norman Lowell]], which promotes [[Pan-europeanism|Pan-European]] ideologies.
* [[Alpha Liberal Democratic Party]], which is led by Drs. [[Emmy Bezzina]] and Dr. [[John Zammit]].

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Malta-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|200px|left|Map of Malta]]
{{Main|Geography of Malta}}
Malta is an [[archipelago]] in the central [[Mediterranean Sea]], some 93 km south of [[Sicily]]. Only the three largest islands [[Malta Island]] (Malta), [[Gozo]] (Għawdex), and [[Comino]] (Kemmuna) are inhabited. The smaller islands, such as [[Filfla]], [[Cominotto]] and [[St.Paul's Islands]] are uninhabited. Numerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape is characterised by low hills with terraced fields. The highest point is at [[Ta' Dmejrek]] on Malta Island at 253 metres (830&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) near [[Dingli]]. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta.

The [[Malta Channel]] to the north separates Malta from the island of [[Sicily]], the largest [[Italy|Italian isle]]. 

[[دوتنه:Malta_satellite_NASA.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Satellite image of Malta]]
The local [[climate]] is Mediterranean [[temperate climate]] with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. There is no real thermal dormant season for plants, although plant growth can be checked briefly by abnormal cold in winter (patches of ground frost may occur in inland locales), and summer heat and aridity may cause vegetation to wilt. Effectively there are only two seasons, which makes the islands attractive for tourists especially during the drier months. Water supply poses a problem on Malta, as the summer is both rainless and also the time of greatest water use, and the winter rainfall often falls as heavy showers and runs off to the sea rather than soaking into the ground.

Contrary to popular belief, the south of Malta is not [[Extreme points of Europe|Europe's most southern point]]: Malta is Europe's 4th southernmost country (excluding France's départements d'outre-mer and similar); [[Spain]] (Punta de Tarifa), [[Cyprus]] and [[Greece]] (island of [[Gavdos]]), rank 3rd, 2nd, and 1st respectively.

== Local Councils ==
{{Main|Local councils of Malta}}

Since 1993, Malta has been subdivided into 68 local councils or localities. These form the most basic form of local government. There are no intermediate levels between local government and national government. A list of them is below:

{{Malta-LocalCouncils}}

== Economy ==
[[دوتنه:Economymalta.jpg|thumb|200px|A Maltese worker producing system components for wireless communication]]
{{Main|Economy of Malta}}
Until 1800, Malta had very few industries except the [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], and shipyards industry. The [[dockyard]] was later used by the British for military purposes. At times of war, Malta's economy prospered due to its strategic location. 

In 1869, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] benefited Malta's economy greatly as there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered in the port.

By the end of the 19th century, the economy began declining and by the 1940s, Malta's economy was in serious crisis. This was due to invention of large ships which did not require refuelling.

Nowadays, Malta’s major resources are [[limestone]], a favourable geographic location, and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of quality hotels are present on the island. 

Malta has recently [[privatization|privatised]] some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets in order to prepare for membership in the [[European Union]], which it joined on [[May 1]] [[2004]]. Malta and [[Tunisia]] are currently discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for petroleum exploration.

The Maltese government entered [[ERM II]] in May 2005, and is intending to adopt the [[euro]] as the country's currency on [[1 January]] [[2008]].

Although Malta is now a member of the European Union, it is not a member of the [[Schengen Treaty]] yet. It is currently adopting Schengen regulations with the goal to be finished by 2007.

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:demographicsmalta.jpg|thumb|200px|The Maltese at their local fish market]]
{{Main|Demographics of Malta}}
A census of population and housing is held every ten years. The last census was held over three weeks in November 2005 and managed to enumerate an estimated 95% of the population. A preliminary report was issued in April 2006, and results were weighted to an estimate for 100% of the population.

<!--Note to Editors: All information, INCLUDING COMMENTARY, is from 2005 census except where indicated. Location for verification and for updating on next year's demographic review are commented.-->The resident population of Malta, which includes foreigners residing in Malta for at least a year, as at 27 November 2005 was estimated at 404,039 of whom 200,715 (49.7%) were males and 203,324 (50.3%) were females<!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842-2005-->. Of these, 17.1 per cent were aged 14 and under, 68.2 per cent were within the 15–64 age bracket whilst the remaining 13.7 per cent were 65 years and over<!--Table 8: Total population by broad age group and locality as at 27 November 2005-->. Malta's population density of 1,282 per [[square kilometre]] (3,322/[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) <!--Table 6: Population density: 1995-2005-->is by far the highest in the EU<!--Table 15: Population density in Europe-->, and one of the [[List of countries by population density|highest]] in the world.

Through all the censuses since 1842 there was always a slightly higher female-to-male ratio. Closest to reaching equality were 1901 and 1911 censi<!-- (1008:1000 and 1003:1000 respectively)-->. The highest female-to-male ratio was reached in 1957 (1088:1000), and since the ratio has been constantly dropping. The 2005 census showed a 1013:1000 female-to-male ratio<!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842-2005-->.

Population growth has slowed down, from +9.5% between the 1985 and 1995 censi, to +6.9% between the 1995 and 2005 censi (a yearly average of +0.7%)<!--Commentary p.xvii & Chart 3: Percentage pouplation change between censuses-->. The birth rate stood at 3860 (a decrease of 21.8% from the 1995 census) and the death rate stood at 3025. Thus, there was a natural population increase of 835 (compared to +888 for 2004, of which over a hundred were foreign residents).<ref name="NSO 20060711">{{cite press release

Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio rose from 17.2% in 1995 to 19.8% in 2005, reasonably lower than the EU's 24.9% average. In fact, 31.5% of the Maltese population is aged under 25 (compared to the EU's 29.1%); but the 50-64 age group consistutes 20.3% of the population, significantly higher than the EU's 17.9%. In conclusion, Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio is expected to continue rising steadily in the coming years<!--Commentary p.xxvii-->.

Maltese legislation recognizes both civil and Canonic marriages. Annulments by the ecclesiastic and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily both granted. There is no divorce legislation and abortion within Maltese territory is illegal. A person has to be 16 to marry.<!--may need citations from the Family Law--> The number of brides aged under 25 decreased from 1471 in 1997 to 766 in 2005; while the number of grooms under 25 decreased from 823 to 311. There is a constant trend that females are more likely than males to marry very young. In 2005, brides aged 16 to 19 were 51 while grooms were 8.<ref name="NSO 20060711"/>

The national language of Malta is [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The [[Maltese alphabet]] is based on the [[Latin alphabet]], but uses the [[diacritic]]ally altered letters ''[[ż]]'', also found in [[Polish language|Polish]], as well as the letters ''[[ċ]]'', ''[[ġ]]'' and ''[[ħ]]'', which are unique to Maltese. The official languages are [[English language|English]] and Maltese. [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] are also widely spoken and taught in secondary schools, though the latter less so. 

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the religion of approximately 98% of the population. See [[Roman Catholicism in Malta]]. 

=== Migration ===

Maltese laws for immigration generally follow EU legislation. Therefore EU nationals require neither a [[visa (document)|visa]] nor a passport (an ID card or an expired passport are enough) to enter the country. Citizens of a number of other countries are also not required to apply for a visa and require only a valid passport when residing in Malta for up to three months. Visas for other nationalities are valid for one month. Immigrants are required to apply for a work permit. This exception to EU law was agreed upon before accession to safeguard the Maltese [[labour economics|labour market]], the growth of which <!-- is there a source for this statement about the growth of the labour market reaching saturation? -->is reaching saturation {{fact}}. In practice though, all work permits to EU nationals are granted, and currently this exercise is only used to monitor the labour market for any needed intervention.

<!--Add statistics on legal immigration and emigration-->The estimated net inflow (using data for 2002 to 2004) was of 1,913 persons yearly. Over the last 10 years, Malta accepted back a yearly average of 425 returning emigrants.<ref name="Demo2004">{{cite book

  | accessdate = 2006-07-06 }} </ref> The reason for such high numbers is that since Malta is the southernmost tip of the European Union and is therefore in the front line when dealing with the heavy northward migration of illegal immigrants from Africa; as well as to Malta's approximately 250,000 square kilometres of open sea search and rescue region.

Malta has historically been generous, just and humane in welcoming illegal immigrants. More than half the illegal immigrants landed in Malta have been granted refugee or protected humanitarian status, which is the highest rate of acceptance in the EU. A [[White Paper]] suggesting the grant of Maltese citizenship to refugees resident in Malta for over ten years was issued in 2005. Historically Malta gave refuge (and assisted in their resettlement) to just about eight hundred East African Asians who had been expelled from [[Uganda]] by [[Idi Amin]] and to just under a thousand [[Iraq]]is fleeing from [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] regime.

Presently the problem of illegal immigration has increased, with severe strains on Malta's health, employment and social services, its internal security and public order, its social fabric and on the labour market. Detention costs for the first half of 2006 alone cost Lm320,423 (€746,385).<ref>{{cite news

== Education ==
Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16 years. Whilst the state provides education free of charge, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and the private sector run a number of schools in Malta and [[Gozo]]. Most of the teachers' salary in Church schools is paid by the state.
Education in Malta is based on the [[Education in the United Kingdom|British Model]]. 
<p>
[[دوتنه:Diagram_of_UK_School_System.PNG|500px]]
<p>
The first years of education in Malta are done in [[kindergarten]]. Attendance is up to 5 years and not compulsory. Compulsory education starts at the age of 6 with primary education. Primary education lasts for 6 years. Following public examinations, students enter secondary education. Following a five-year course preparing for the "Secondary Education Certificate" (SEC), equivalent to the British [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), students sit for final examinations (results are used in the school-leaving certificate), and in general also sit for the SEC examinations. SEC examinations require students to be aged 16 and over, or to have a school-leaving certificate. Students who have repeated years are therefore able to apportion their SEC examinations over the last two years at school.
[[دوتنه:educationmalta.jpg|thumb|200px|Students during the Graduation Ceremony at the University of Malta]]
Once compulsory secondary education ends, students may enter either in a vocational college such as [[MCAST]] or a [[Sixth Form]]. [[Sixth Form|Sixth forms]] provide a two-year course leading to the "Matriculation Certificate", which is the equivalent of the UK Advanced Level Examinations and Advanced Subsidiary Examinations. For students unsuccessful in their SEC examinations, there is the option of attending a Higher Secondary school, a sort of safety net to give students the possibility to catch up, where any core subjects (mathematics, English language, Maltese, and a natural science) previously failed are again taught at ordinary level in preparation for SEC examinations, while also teaching intermediate and advanced level subjects. Students may also choose to attend specialised private institutions leading to diplomas and degrees of foreign examination bodies in careers such as IT ([[London University]]), Networking ([[CISCO]]), Accountancy ([[ACCA]]) and Banking.

Tertiary education at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate level is mainly provided by the [[University of Malta]] (UoM). Qualifications from the UoM are fully recognised internationally after its conversion to using the European ECTS credits system. Admission requires a minimum overall C grade in the [[Matriculation Certificate]] and passes at ordinary level of the core subjects. Special course requirements are mostly based on single-subject results in the Matriculation Certificate. Some of the qualifications obtained from private institutions are also recognised. Full-time attendance by Maltese citizens is free-of-charge, while part-time (evening) attendance is not.

The Employment and Training Corporation (ETC) satisfies one of its dual roles by offering training for adults of any age and experience.  The University of Malta offers similar courses and also gives the option of entering normal full-/part-time courses as a ''mature student'' - persons aged 23 and over are exempted from satisfying the University entry requirements, though they still have to satisfy any special course requirements.

The adult [[literacy rate]] is 92.8%<!--Source: CIA Factbook, August 2006. See external links-->.
