The '''Republic of Kenya''' is a country in [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. It is bordered by [[اېتوپيا]] to the north, [[Somalia]] to the east, [[Tanzania]] to the south, [[يوګانډا]] to the west, and [[سوډان]] to the northwest, with the [[Indian Ocean]] running down the southeast border. 

== تاريخ ==

{{main|History of Kenya}}

=== د تاريخ دمخه ===
Fossils found in East Africa suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago. Recent finds near Kenya's [[Lake Turkana]] indicate that hominids such as ''[[homo habilis]]'' (1.8 and 2.5 million years ago) and ''[[homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million to 350,000 years ago) are possible direct ancestors of modern [[Homo sapiens]] and lived in Kenya during the [[pleistocene]]. In [[1984]] one particular discovery made at [[Lake Turkana]] by famous paleanthropologist [[Richard Leakey]] and [[Kamoya Kimeu]] was the skeleton of [[Turkana boy]] belonging to Homo erectus from 1.6 million years ago.

=== Colonial history ===
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first [[Europe]]ans to explore Kenya, [[Vasco da Gama]] having visited [[Mombasa]] in 1498. There followed a period of Portuguese rule centered mainly on the coastal strip ranging from [[Malindi]] to [[Mombasa]]. The Portuguese colonial presence in East Africa officially begins after 1505, when flagships under the command of Dom Francisco de Almeida bombarded and plundered Kilwa, an island located in what is now southern Tanzania. Following this, the Portuguese sacked Mombasa following the refusal of the town's leadership to pay tribute. Attacks followed on Hoja (now known as Ungwana, located at the mouth of the [[Tana River]]), Barawa, Angoche, Pate and other coastal towns until the western Indian Ocean was a safe haven for Portuguese commercial interests and tribute was paid to the Portuguese crown by all of the city-states along the East African coast. The Portuguese colonial presence in East Africa served two primary purposes: the extraction of tribute from coastal polities and the control of trade within the Indian Ocean through piracy. The first objective was only mildly successful by all accounts as local East African rulers rebelled against the Portuguese frequently. However, Portuguese naval vessels were very disruptive to commerce within the western Indian Ocean and were able to demand high tariffs on items transported through the sea due to their strategic control of ports and shipping lanes. The construction of Fort Jesus in Mombasa 1593 was meant to solidify Portuguese hegemony in the region, but their influence was clipped by the British, Dutch and Omani Arab incursions into the region during the 17th century. The Omani Arabs posed the most direct challenge to Portuguese influence in East Africa and besieged Portuguese fortresses, openly attacked naval vessels and completely expelled the Portuguese from the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts by 1730.

Omani Arab colonization of the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts brought the once independent city-states under closer foreign scrutiny and domination than was experienced during the Portuguese period. Like their predecessors, the Omani Arabs were primarily able only to control the coastal areas, not the interior. However, the creation of clove plantations, intensification of the slave trade and relocation of the Omani capital to Zanzibar in 1839 by Seyyid Said had the effect of consolidating the Omani power in the region. Arab governance of all the major ports along the East African coast continued until British interests aimed particularly at ending the slave trade and creation of a wage-labor system began to put pressure on Omani rule. By the late 19th century, the slave trade on the open seas had been completely outlawed by the British and the Omani Arabs had little ability to resist the British navy’s ability to enforce the directive. The Omani presence continued in Zanzibar and Pemba until the 1964 revolution, but the official Omani Arab presence in Kenya was checked by German and British seizure of key ports and creation of crucial trade alliances with influential local leaders in the 1880s. However, the Omani Arab legacy in East Africa is currently found through their numerous descendants found along the coast that can directly trace ancestry to Oman and are typically the wealthiest and most politically influential members of the Kenyan coastal community.

However, most historians consider that the colonial history of Kenya dates from the establishment of a [[Germany|German]] protectorate over the Sultan of [[Zanzibar]]'s coastal possessions in [[1885]], followed by the arrival of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] in [[1888]]. Incipient imperial rivalry was forestalled when Germany handed its coastal holdings to [[Britain]] in 1890. This followed the building of the Kenya-Uganda railway passing through the country. Although this was also resisted by some tribes, notably the [[Nandi people|Nandi]] led by ''Orkoiyot'' Koitalel arap Samoei for ten years from 1895 to 1905, these did not stop the British building the railway. It is believed that the ''Nandi'' were the first tribe to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway.

During the early part of the [[20th century]], the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers, who became wealthy farming [[coffee]]. By the 1930's, approximately 30,000 [[settler]]s lived in the area and were offered undue political powers because of their effects on the economy. The area was already home to over a million members of the [[Kĩkũyũ]] tribe, most of whom had no land claims in European terms (but the land belonged to the ethnic group), and lived as itinerant [[farmer]]s. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut [[tax]], and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled.

From [[1952|October 1952]] to [[1959|December 1959]], Kenya was under a state of emergency arising from the [[Mau Mau]] rebellion against British rule. The governor requested and obtained British and African troops, including the [[King's African Rifles]]. In [[1953|January 1953]], [[Major General Hinde]] was appointed as director of counter-insurgency operations. The situation did not improve for lack of intelligence, so [[General Sir George Erskine]] was appointed commander-in-chief of the colony's armed forces in [[May 1953]], with the personal backing of [[Winston Churchill]]. The capture of Warǔhiǔ Itote ([[General China]]) on [[15 January]] [[1954]] and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure. [[Operation Anvil]] opened on [[24 April]] [[1954]] after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed [[Nairobi]] under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to [[detention camp]]s. May [[1953]] also saw the [[Home Guard]] officially recognized as a branch of the Security Forces. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's anti-Mau Mau strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the [[British Army]] and [[King's African Rifles]]. By the end of the emergency the [[Home Guard]] had killed no fewer than 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents. The capture of [[Dedan Kimathi]] on [[21 October]] [[1956]] in [[Nyeri]] signified the ultimate defeat of the [[Mau Mau]] and essentially ended the military offensive.

=== Post-colonial history ===
The first direct elections for Africans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957. Despite British hopes of handing power to "moderate" African rivals, it was the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) of [[Jomo Kenyatta]], that formed a government shortly before Kenya became independent on [[12th December]] [[1963]]. A year later, Kenyatta became Kenya's first president. At Kenyatta's death in [[1978]], [[Daniel arap Moi]] became President. Daniel arap Moi retained the Presidency, being unopposed in elections held in 1979, 1983 ([[snap election]]s) and 1988, all of which were held under the single party constitution. The 1983 elections were held a year early, and were a direct result of an abortive military coup attempt on August 1, 1982. The abortive coup was masterminded by a lowly ranked Airforce serviceman, Senior Private Hezekiah Ochuka and was staged mainly by enlisted men in the Air Force. The attempt was quickly suppressed by Loyalist forces led by the Army, the General Service Unit (GSU) — paramilitary wing of the police — and later the regular police, but not without civilian casualties. This event led to the disbanding of the entire Airforce and a large number of its former members were either dismissed or court-martialled. The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the ''mlolongo'' (queuing) system where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of secret ballot. This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform. Several contentious clauses, including the one allowing only one political party were changed in the following years. In democratic, multiparty elections in 1992 and 1997, Daniel arap Moi won re-election. In [[2002]], Moi was constitutionally barred from running, and [[Mwai Kibaki|Mwai Kǐbakǐ]], running for the opposition coalition "National Rainbow Coalition" — [[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]], was elected President. The elections, judged free and fair by local and international observers, marked a turning point in Kenya's democratic evolution.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Kenya}}
Politics of Kenya takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Kenya]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Kenya|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

== Administrative Divisions ==
{{main|Subdivisions of Kenya}}
[[دوتنه:Kenya_Provinces_numbered_300px.png|200px|thumb|The provinces of Kenya.]]
Kenya comprises seven [[province]]s each headed by a centrally-appointed Provincial Commissioner, and one area. The [[province]]s (''Mikoa'') are subdivided into 71 [[district]]s (''[[Wilaya]]'') which are then subdivided into 262 [[division (subnational entity)|divisions]] (''Taarafa''). The [[division (subnational entity)|divisions]] are then subdivided into approximately 1,088 [[township (South Africa)|locations]] (''Mtaa'') and then [[sub location]] (''Kijiji''). The City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative province. The government supervises administration of districts and provinces.

The [[Subdivisions of Kenya|provinces]] (and area) include:

# [[Central Province, Kenya|Central]]
# [[Coast Province, Kenya|Coast]]
# [[Eastern Province, Kenya|Eastern]]
# [[Nairobi Area]]
# [[North Eastern Province, Kenya|North Eastern]]
# [[Nyanza Province, Kenya|Nyanza]]

# [[Western Province, Kenya|Western]]

[[دوتنه:Kenya_sm02.png|thumb|Map of Kenya]]

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Kenya}}
{{MapLibrary|Kenya_sat.png|Kenya}}
Kenya covers an area of 582,646 [[Square kilometre]]s<!--citation needed--> (224,961&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]). From the coast on the [[Indian Ocean]] the Low plains rise to central highlands. The highlands are bisected by [[Great Rift Valley]]; fertile plateau in west. The Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. The highlands are the site of the highest point in Kenya: [[Mount Kenya]], which reaches 5,199 metres (17,057&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and is also the site of glaciers. Climate varies from [[tropical]] along the coast to [[arid]] in interior.

== Environment ==

Kenya has considerable land area of [[wildlife]] habitat, including much of the [[Serengeti]] plain, where [[Blue Wildebeest]] and other [[bovid]]s participate in a large scale annual migration.  Up to 250,000 Blue Wildebeest perish each year in the long and arduous movement to find forage in the dry season. The "Big Five" animals of Africa can also be found in Kenya and these include the Lion, the Leopard, the Buffalo, the Rhino and the biggest one of them - the Elephant.

== Climate ==
Kenya enjoys a tropical climate. It is hot and humid at the coast, temperate inland and very dry in the north and northeast parts of the country.

The country receives a great deal of sunshine all the year round and summer clothes are worn throughout the year. However, it is usually cool at night and early in the morning.

The long rain season occurs from April to June. The short rain season occurs from October to December. The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and evenings. The hottest period is from February to March and coldest in July to August.

The annual migration occurs between June and September with millions of wildlife taking part. It has been a popular event for filmmakers to capture.

== Economy ==

{{main|Economy of Kenya}}
Kenya's main economic strengths include [[tourism]] and [[agriculture]]. The economy is only now beginning to show some growth after years of stagnation. Some argue that this slow economic growth is because of poor management and uneven commitment to reform; others insist that it is due to falling commodity prices and poor access to Western markets. 

In [[1993]], the government of Kenya implemented a program of economic [[liberalization]] and reform that included the removal of import licensing, [[price controls]], and [[foreign exchange controls]]. With the support of the [[World Bank]], [[IMF]], and other donors, the reforms led to a brief turnaround in economic performance following a period of [[economic growth|negative growth]] in the early [[1990s]]. One of the unintended consequence of freeing foreign exchange control was that it allowed a [[Goldenberg scandal|gold-and-diamond export scam]] in which the Kenyan government lost over 600 million U.S. dollars. This resulted in a weak currency which hindered economic improvement. 

Kenya's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] grew 5% in [[1995]] and 4% in [[1996]], and [[inflation]] remained under control. Growth slowed in [[1997]]–[[1999]] however. Political violence—namely the bombing of the U.S. [[Embassy]] by [[Al Qaeda]] in [[1998]]—damaged the tourist industry, and [[Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program]] lapsed. A new economic team was put in place in 1999 to revitalize the reform effort, strengthen the civil service, and curb corruption, but wary donors continue to question the government's commitment to western establishment ideas of sound economic policy.

Considered by some to be long-term barriers to development are: electricity shortages, the government's continued and allegedly inefficient dominance of key sectors, [[Political corruption|corruption]], the foreign debt burden, unstable international commodity prices, poor communication infrastructure and the effects of HIV/AIDS, which is having its effect on the most productive group of the population. The effect of HIV/AIDS has largely offset the previous high population growth that was caused by a high birth rate and reduced infant mortality due to better health care.

Chief among Kenya's exports are: flowers (horticulture), fruits and vegetables, tea, and coffee. Another key foreign exchange earner is tourism. Tourism has grown tremendously since 2003. The number of foreigners coming to Kenya has increased as attested to by the airlines operating in Kenya. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenyaspace.com|title=Kenyaspace!|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>



== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Kenya}}
Kenya is a country of great ethnic diversity. Tension between the various groups accounts for many of Kenya's problems. During the early [[1990s]], Politicaly instigated Tribal clashes killed thousands and left tens of thousands homeless. The [[KANU]] regime at the time headed by Former President [[Daniel Toroitich arap Moi]] was blamed for instigating the violence as away of discouraging Multi Party Politics and cling to power.{{fact}} Ethnically split opposition groups allowed the regime of [[Daniel arap Moi]], in power from [[1978]] until [[2002]], to be re-elected for four terms, with the election in [[1997]] being marred by violence and fraud.

Ethnic groups: [[Kikuyu|Kĩkũyũ]] 22%, [[Luhya]] 14%, [[Luo (Kenya)|Luo]] 13%, [[Kalenjin]] 12%, [[Kamba]] 11%, [[Kisii people|Kisii]] 6%, [[Ameru]] 6%, other African 15%, non-African ([[Asian]]/[[Desi]], [[European]], and [[Arab]]) 1%.

Religious affiliation: Various [[Protestant]] 45%, [[Catholic Church in Kenya|Roman Catholic]] 33%, [[Islam|Muslim]] 10%, Traditional Religions 10%. Others include Hinduism, [[Jainism]] & the [[Bahá'í Faith]].
{{see also|List of cities in Kenya|Maasai}}

== Culture ==
[[دوتنه:Kenyan_man.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A Maasai man in traditional attire]]
{{main|Culture of Kenya}}
Kenya is a diverse country, with many different cultures represented. Notable cultures include the [[Swahili]] on the coast, pastoralist communities in the north, and several different communities in the central and western regions. Today, the [[Massai]] culture is the best known, due to its heavy exposure from tourism. 

=== National dress ===


Apart from the national flag, Kenya is yet to have a national dress that cuts across her diverse ethnic and racial divide. With each of the more than 42 ethnic communities in Kenya having its own traditional practices and symbols that make it unique, this is a task that has proved elusive in the past. However, several attempts have been made to design an outfit that can be worn to identify Kenyans, much like the Kente cloth of Ghana. 
The most recent effort is the Unilever sponsored "Sunlight quest for Kenya's National Dress". A design was chosen and though it was unveiled with much pomp at a ceremony in which public figures modelled the dress, the dress design never took hold with the ordinary people. 
Kitenge, a cotton fabric made into various colours and design through tie-and-dye and heavy embroidery, is generally accepted as the African dress. Though used in many African countries, Kitenge is yet to be accepted as an official dress as it is only worn during ceremonies and non-official functions
The Kanga (Khanga, Lesso) is another cloth that is in common use in practically every Kenyan home. The Kanga is a piece of clothing 1.5m by 1m approx, that is screen printed with beautiful sayings in Kiswahili (or English) and is largely worn by women around the waist and torso. Kangas are a flexible item, used in many ways such as aprons, child carrying slings, picnic blankets, swimwear etc. However, except for the Coastal people, it is usually not worn as a full outfit.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of Kenya}}
Kenya is home to a diverse range of music styles, ranging from imported popular music to traditional folk songs. The guitar is the most popular instrument in Kenyan music, and songs often feature intricate guitar rhythms. The most famous guitarist of the early 20th century was [[Fundi Konde]].

Modern popular music can be divided into two genres: the [[Swahili]] sound and the [[Congolese]] sound. There are varying regional styles, and performers often create tourist-oriented "hotel pop" that is similar to western music.

=== Sports ===
Kenya is active in several [[sports]], among them [[football (soccer)]], [[cricket]] and [[boxing]].  But the country is known chiefly for its dominance in [[Cross country running|cross country]] and [[road running]], and middle and [[Long-distance track event|long-distance]] [[athletics]].  Kenya has regularly produced [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] champions in various distance events, especially in 800 m, 1,500 m, 3,000 m steeplechase, 5,000 m, 10,000 m and cross country races.  Kenyan athletes continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from [[Morocco]] and [[Ethiopia]] has somewhat reduced this supremacy.  The [[Marathon (sport)|Marathon]] world record holder, [[Paul Tergat]], and the current women's [[Boston Marathon]] champion, [[Catherine Ndereba]], are among the best-known athletes in Kenya.  Retired [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] champion [[Kipchoge Keino]], who helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty [[1970s]] even before fellow Commonwealth champion [[Henry Rono]]'s spectacular string of world record performances, is currently Kenya's most famous sportsmen.   Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]].  The [[Kenyan Ministry of Sports]] has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with [[Bernard Lagat]] the latest, choosing to represent the [[United States]].

Kenya is now beginning to be a force to reckon with in [[rugby]].  Rugby has always been popular in Kenya especially with the Annual Tusker Sevens tournament but only recently has the country begun to be noticed on the international circuit.  Most notable was their 15-12 win over [[Australia]] in the [[2003]] [[Hong Kong]] Sevens tournament.  Sevens is slowly on the up and, with a population of almost 30 million people, the country has some potential talent to pick from.

{{Kenya at the Commonwealth Games}}

=== Film and theatre ===
Kenya holds one of the biggest annual drama events, the Kenya schools and colleges drama festival, in the south of [[Sahara]]. Although the government has not been very supportive of the [[film industry]] in Kenya, the country offers some of the most spectacular sceneries and can only be compared to [[South Africa]] in regard to producing some of the most talented actors and actresses on the African continent. Due to the nonchalant attitude and lack of enthusiasm exhibited by the government, the industry has remained considerably dormant whereby notable movies shot in the country have been few and far between. The most recent movie is the award winning ''[[The Constant Gardener]]'' Directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]] and Starring [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Notable film actors from Kenya include Paul Onsongo, [[John Sibi Okumu]] and [[Njeri Osak]]. 
Acting for television has proved popular with the Kenyan audience. This genre of drama has been around from the 1960s when actors like Mzee Pembe and Mama Njeri graced the Kenyan television screen. Others, like Benson Wanjau and Mary Khabeele, followed later with their rib-cracking comedies presented exclusively in [[Kiswahili]]. Serious television drama was witnessed for the first time in the early 1990s with the entry of actors like [[Packson Ngugi]] and [[BMJ Muriithi]]. A new genre in the form of stand-up comedy followed with the entry of the group, 'Redikyulas' comprised of a trio of very funny young comedians who specialised in political satire.They poked fun not only at the establishment but also at the then kenyan president, [[Daniel Arap Moi]]. This was hitherto unheard of and could have led to their prosecution, or even detention without trial,  had it been done in the 1980s when mimicking the head of state or exhibiting any form of political dissent was considered treasonable.
