Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Astronomers of early civilizations performed methodical observations of the night sky, and astronomical artifacts have been found from much earlier periods. However, the invention of the [[telescope]] was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science.

Since the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astrophysics|theoretical]] branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring and analyzing data, mainly using basic principles of [[physics]].  Theoretical astronomy is oriented towards the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results, and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.

Historically, [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] have contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, and astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena.

Modern astronomy is not to be confused with [[astrology]], the belief system that claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects. Although the [[Astrology and astronomy|two fields]] share a common origin, most thinkers in both fields believe they are now distinct.<ref name="new cosmos">{{cite book | author=Albrecht Unsöld | coauthors=Bodo Baschek, W.D.

== د كائناتو پېداېښت (لويه چاودنه) (بګ بېنګ) ==
د كائناتو د [[پېداېښت]] په اړه چې د ستورپېژندونكيو پوهانو كومه [[نظريه]] وړاندې كړې كومه چې نن د ټولو په نزد د منلو وړ ده، او هغه [[نظريه]] چې دا كائنات د يوې لوې چاودنې (بګ بېنګ) په [[نتيجه]] كې منځته راغلي. ددې نظريې تائيد تر څو پېړيو پورې د ستورپېژندونكيو پوهانو د تجربو او لرليدو څخه د لاسته راوړنو له پاېلو څخه هم ؤ. د لوى چاودنې نظريې سره سم دا كاېنات په لومړي سر كې د ناټاكلې شكل په لرلو سره د يوه ستر كاڼي (Primary Nebula) په څېر وه. 

بيا د يوې سترې چاودنې (secondaray separation) په [[نتيجه]] كې كهكشانونه راپېدا شول. او دا كهكشانونه نور زيات ووېشل شول، چې لدې وېش څخه بيا [[ستورې]]، سيارې، [[لمر]] او [[سپوږمۍ]] راپېدا شول. 
د كاېناتو [[پېدېښت] په يوه ځانګړي او له [[عقل] څخه وتلي ډول سره شوې. ددې كاېناتو [[پېداېښت]] په خپلسرې ډول له شونياوو څخه وتلې. 
[[قرآن كريم ]]د كاېناتو د پېداښت راز په داسې راښكاره كوي: 
** ژباړه: آيا كاپرانو پدې خبره غور او فكر ندې كړې چې (لومړې مو) [[اسمان]] او [[زمكه]] (سره) يو ځاى (نښتي) ول، بيا موږ سره جلا جلا كړل.( القرآن، ۳۰-۲۱)

د [[قرآن كريم ]]ددې [[آيت]] او د لوې چاودنې د نظريې ترمنځ چې كوم همغږي او يوشانته والې ليدل كېږي د هغې رد په هېڅ ډول ناشونې دى. دا څرنګه كېداى شي چې ۱۴ پېړۍ مخكې د عربو په صحرا كې  داسې يو كتاب بياموندل شي چې داسې يوه رېښتوني ساېنسي حقيقت  پكې موجود وي. 

== د كېس ستر غونډارې ==
د كهكشانو له [[پېداېښت]] څخه مخكې د [[ګېس]] يو ستر غونډارې:
ستورپېژندونكي پدې ګروهه دي چې په كون د كهكشانونو منځته راتلو څخه مخكې دا كون ټول له سره د [[ګېس]] په څېر ول، يانې له كهكشانونو څخه مخكې دا كون د يوه ستر ګېسي غونډارو يا ورېځو په څېر ؤ. او يا ددې مادې لپاره د [[ګېس]] څخه د دوړو كلېمه استعمالول لږ څه ښه راځي، (يانې يوه غېر متشكله دوړو په څېر). 
د كون دې شكل ته [[قرآن كريم ]]په لاندې [[آيت]] كې داسې اشاره كوي او د (دخان) كلېمه يې راوړې چې د دوړې يا دود په مانا راځي:

** ژباړه: بيا هه د [[اسمان]] اړخ ته پام وړ، كوم چې په هغه وخت كې يوه دوړه وه. هغه [[اسمان]] او زمكې ته وويل: (موجود شئ، كه چېرې ستاسو غواړئ او يا نه غواړئ. دواړو وويل: موږ راغلو امر منونكيو په څېر). (القرآن، ۱۱-۴۱)
وګورئ [[قرآن كريم ]]يو بل بيان د (بګ بېنګ) له نظريې سره يوشانوالې.  آيا دا رېښتيا د محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم له [[پېداېښت]] څخه مخكې چاته مالوم ول؟ نو بيا ددې ستر ساېنسي حقيقت كومه بله ذريعه كېدا شي؟ (د بګ بېنګ [[نظريه]] د تېر نږدې وخت ده، خو [[قرآن كريم ]]دا حقيقت ۱۴ پېړۍ مخكې بيان كړې دى. 

== د ستورو ترمنځ څه دي؟ ==
په لومړي سر كې داسې ګومان كېده چې د منظمو فلكي نظامونو څخه اخوا خلا بېخي تشه ده، مګر نن سبا ساېنسي ستورپېژندونكي دې پاېلې ته ورسېدل چې د ستور ترمنځ داسې يوه ماده شته چې د پل (bridge) په څېر دى او دې مادې ته يې د پلازما نوم وركړ. دا ماده په بشپړ ډول سره اوسپنه كړاى شوې (ionized) [[ګېس]] لرونكې ده. پدې ماده كې په مساوي ډول منفي چارچ لرونكي خپلواك الكترونونه او مثبت چارچ لرونكي  برقي پاڼې (Ions) موجودې دي. پلامزما ته كله كله د مادې څلورم حالت هم وايي. ( د مادې درې مشهور حالتونه دي: جامد، ماېع او [[ګېس]]). څښتن تعالى د [[قرآن كريم ]]په لاندې [[آيت]] كې د ستورو ترمنځ تشه كې د موجودې مادې په اړه داسې فرمايي:
** ژباړه: (هغه چا چې په ۶ ورځو كې [[زمكه]] او [[اسمان]] او هرهغه څه پېدا كړل، چې د [[اسمان]] او زمكې ترمنځ وي. القرآن، ۵۹-۲۵). 

== [[زمكه]] ګرده ده ==
له لومړيو وختو كې خلكو دا ګومان كاوه چې [[زمكه]] هوار ده، او ددې لپاره به يې د لرې واټن له سفر كولو څخه ځانونه ژغورل، چې نه چېرې د زمكې په ختمېدو سره د هغې له لمنو څخه لاندې ونه لوېږي.  فرانسس ډرېك لومړنې كس ؤ چې په ۱۵۹۷زېږيز كال كې يې په بحري بېړۍ كې د زمكې ګردچاپېره سفر وكړ، او دا يې په زبات ورسوله چې [[زمكه]] په اصل كې ګرده ( كروي) ده.
 

== فضا ته د ختلو نوې سيالۍ ==
 
چين تېره اوونۍ په دوهم ځل فضا ته د خپل ستور مزلي په لېږلو سره دا ثابته کړه چې دوى هم د هغو يوازي د گوتوشمېر هېوادونو په ډله کې راځي چې فضا ته يې لار موندلې ده.
خو څرنگه چې چين غواړي په ٢٠٠٧ ميلادي کال کې سپوږمۍ ته فضايي بېړۍ وليږي، او همداراز يې د امريکا او هندوستان په څېر سپوږمۍ ته د خپلو ستور مزلو د لېږلو په اړه خپله لېوالتيا ښودلې، دا ښيي چې يوه نوې فضايي سيالي پيل شوې ده.

هندوستان هم د چين تر اعلان وروسته سپوږمۍ ته د خپلې فضايي بېړۍ د لېږلو په اړه خپل هوډ څرگند کړ او په دې لړ کې يې د اروپا له فضايي ادارې سره د گډو ازمويونو په اړه يو تړون لاسليک کړ.

جاپان هم له وړاندي لا سپوږمۍ ته خپله فضايي بېړۍ لېږلې ده.

ددې تر څنگ امريکا مريخ ته هم د ستورمزلي د لېږلو اعلان کړى دى.

خو له دې سيالۍ سره سره کارپوهان په دې باور دي چې هېوادونه به اړ وي چې د دغسې لو يو او گرانو پروژو په لړ کې له يوه او بل سره همکاري وکړي.

==Lexicology==

The word ''astronomy'' literally means "law of the stars" and is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αστρονομία, ''astronomia'', from the words άστρον (''astron'', "star") and νόμος (''nomos'', "laws of naming").

==History==
{{main|History of astronomy}}
{{see|Archaeoastronomy}}
[[Image:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|200 px|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the Dutch cartographer Frederik de Wit.]]
In early times, astronomy only comprised the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, such as [[Stonehenge]], early cultures assembled massive artifacts that likely had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.<ref name="history">{{cite book | author=George Forbes | title=History of Astronomy | publisher=Watts & Co. | location=London  | year=1909 | format =Free e-book from [[Project Gutenberg]] | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8172 }}</ref>

Before tools such as the telescope were invented early study of the stars had to be conducted from the only vantage points available, namely tall buildings, trees and high ground using the bare eye.

As civilizations developed, most notably [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Persia]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Hellenic civilization|Greece]], [[History of India|India]], and [[China]], astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas on the nature of the universe began to be explored. Early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the universe.

A few notable astronomical discoveries were made prior to the application of the telescope. For example, the [[Axial tilt|obliquity of the ecliptic]] was estimated as early as 1,000 B.C by the Chinese. The [[Babylonia|Chaldean]]s discovered that [[eclipses]] recurred in a repeating cycle known as a [[Saros cycle|saros]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} In the second century B.C., the size and distance of the Moon were estimated by [[Hipparchus]].

During the Middle Ages, observational astronomy was mostly stagnant in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, at least until the [[13th century]]. However, observational astronomy flourished in the [[Persian Empire]] and other parts of the world. Astronomers during that time introduced many names that are now used for individual stars.<ref name="short history">{{cite book | author=Arthur Berry | title=A Short History of Astronomy From Earliest Times Through the Nineteenth Century | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. | location=New York | year=1961 }}</ref><ref name="Cambridge history">{{cite book | editor=Michael Hoskin | title=The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy | publisher=Cambridge University Press  | year=1999 | id = ISBN 0-521-57600-8 }}</ref>

===Scientific revolution===
[[Image:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Galileo's sketches and observations of the Moon revealed that the surface was mountainous]]

During the [[Renaissance]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] proposed a [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]]. His work was defended, expanded upon, and corrected by [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]. Galileo innovated by using telescopes to enhance his observations.

Kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton's]] invention of [[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]] to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the [[reflecting telescope]].

Further discoveries paralleled the improvements in the size and quality of the telescope. More extensive star catalogues were produced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]]. The astronomer [[William Herschel]] made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet [[Uranus]], the first new planet found. The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the [[parallax]] of [[61 Cygni]] was measured by [[Friedrich Bessel]].

During the nineteenth century, attention to the [[three body problem]] by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Alexis Claude Clairaut|Clairaut]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]], allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.

Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]]. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]] discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814-15, which, in 1859, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of [[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es, and sizes.<ref name="short history" />

The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], as a separate group of stars, was only proved in the [[20th century]], along with the existence of "external" galaxies, and soon after, the expansion of the [[universe]], seen in the recession of most galaxies from us. Modern astronomy has also discovered many exotic objects such as [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[blazar]]s, and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]], and has used these observations to develop physical theories which describe some of these objects in terms of equally exotic objects such as [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s. [[Physical cosmology]] made huge advances during the 20th century, with the model of the [[Big Bang]] heavily supported by the evidence provided by astronomy and physics, such as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], [[Hubble's law]], and [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|cosmological abundances of elements]].

==Astronomical observations==
[[Image:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Radio telescope]]s are among the many different tools used by astronomers]]

In [[Babylon]] and ancient Greece, astronomy consisted largely of [[astrometry]], measuring the positions of stars and planets in the sky. Later, the work of [[astronomers]] [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] led to the development of [[celestial mechanics]], and astronomy focused on mathematically predicting the motions of [[gravity|gravitationally]] interacting celestial bodies. This was applied to [[solar system]] objects in particular. Today, the motions and positions of objects are more easily determined, and modern astronomy concentrates on observing and understanding the physical nature of celestial objects.

===Methods of data collection===
{{main|Observational astronomy}}
In astronomy, [[information]] is mainly received from the detection and analysis of light and other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html | title = Electromagnetic Spectrum | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref> However, useful information has also been acquired using [[neutrino]] detectors. These have been used to observe solar neutrinos, and neutrino emissions from [[supernova]]e have also been detected. There are also instruments to observe the effects of [[cosmic ray]]s, and, in the near future, several experiments are designed to detect [[gravitational wave]]s.<ref>{{cite web | author = G. A. Tammann, F. K. Thielemann, D. Trautmann | date = 2003 | url=http://www.europhysicsnews.com/full/20/article8/article8.html | title = Opening new windows in observing the Universe | publisher = Europhysics News | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}</ref>

A traditional division among astronomy fields is based on the region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] observed. At the low frequency end of the spectrum, [[radio astronomy]] detects [[radiation]] in [[wavelength]]s measuring between a millimeter and a dekameter. The [[radio telescope]] receivers are similar to those used in [[radio]] broadcast transmissions, but are much more sensitive. [[Microwave]]s form the millimeter end of the radio spectrum, and are important for studies of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].

[[Infrared astronomy]] and [[far infrared astronomy]] deal with the detection and analysis of [[infrared]] radiation (wavelengths longer than red light). The most common instrument used to isolate this band is a telescope that uses a detector which is sensitive to the infrared. Infrared radiation is heavily absorbed by atmospheric [[water vapor]], so infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places or in outer space. [[Space telescope]]s in particular avoid atmospheric thermal emissions, atmospheric opacity, and the negative effects of [[astronomical seeing]] at infrared and other wavelengths. Infrared is particularly useful for observation of galactic regions cloaked by dust, and for studies of molecular gases.
[[Image:The Keck Subaru and Infrared obervatories.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Because of the altitude and isolation, the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] has some of the best observing conditions on Earth]]

Historically, most astronomical data has been collected through [[optical astronomy]]. This is the portion of the spectrum that uses optical components (mirrors, lenses, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD detectors]] and [[photographic film]]s) to observe [[light]] from near infrared to near ultraviolet wavelengths. [[Visible light astronomy]] (using [[wavelength]]s that can be detected with the eyes, about [[1 E-7 m|400&ndash;700 nm]]) falls in the middle of this range. The most common instrument is the [[telescope]], with [[electronic imager]]s and [[spectrograph]]s.

More energetic sources are observed and studied in [[high-energy astronomy]], which includes [[X-ray]] astronomy, [[gamma ray]] astronomy, and extreme UV ([[ultraviolet]]) astronomy, as well as the studies of [[neutrino]]s and cosmic rays.

Optical and radio astronomy can be performed with ground-based [[observatory|observatories]], because the Earth's atmosphere is transparent at the wavelengths being detected. The atmosphere is [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] at the wavelengths of [[X-ray astronomy]], [[gamma-ray astronomy]], [[UV astronomy]], and (except for a few wavelength "windows") [[far infrared astronomy]], so observations must be carried out mostly from [[research balloon|balloons]] or [[space observatory|space observatories]]. Powerful gamma rays can, however, be detected by the large [[air shower (physics)|air shower]]s that they produce; and the study of cosmic rays can also be regarded as a branch of astronomy.<ref name="spectrum">{{cite web | last = Penston | first = Margaret J. | date = 2002-08-14 | url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&style=feature | title = The electromagnetic spectrum | publisher = Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council | accessdate = 2006-08-17 }}</ref>

Planetary astronomy has benefited from direct observation in the form of spacecraft and sample return missions. These include fly-by missions with remote sensors; landing vehicles that can perform experiments on the surface materials; impactors that allow remote sensing of buried material, and sample return missions that allow direct, laboratory examination.

===Astrometry and celestial mechanics===
{{main|Astrometry|Celestial mechanics}}
One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in [[celestial navigation]].

Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as [[celestial mechanics]]. More recently the tracking of [[near-Earth object]]s will allow for predictions of close encounters, and potential collisions, with the Earth.<ref>{{cite web | last = Calvert | first = James B. | date = 2003-03-28 | url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm | title = Celestial Mechanics | publisher = University of Denver | accessdate = 2006-08-21 }}</ref>

The measurement of [[parallax|stellar parallax]] of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] that is used to measure the scale of the universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, because their properties can be compared. Measurements of [[radial velocity]] and [[proper motion]] show the kinematics of these systems through the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Astrometric results are also used to measure the distribution of [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html | title = Hall of Precision Astrometry | publisher = University of Virginia Department of Astronomy | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref>

==Subfields of astronomy==

Astronomy may be divided into several subfields depending on the approach used in research, the part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] used for for study, or the types of astronomical objects being studied.

===Subfields for specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum===

====Radio astronomy====

[[Radio astronomy]] studies radiation with [[wavelength]]s greater than approximately one [[millimeter]].<ref name="cox2000">{{cite book
  | author=A. N. Cox, editor
  | title=Allen's Astrophysical Quantities
  | year=2000
  | publisher=Springer-Verlag
  | location=New York
  | id=ISBN 0-387-98746-0}}</ref>  Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed [[radio wave]]s can be treated as [[wave]]s rather than as discrete [[photon]]s.  Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the [[amplitude]] and [[phase]] of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.<ref name="cox2000"/>  

Although some [[radio wave]]s are produced by astronomical objects in the form of [[black body radiation|thermal emission]], most of the radio emission that is observed from Earth is seem in the form of [[synchrotron radiation]], which is produced when [[electron]]s oscillate around [[magnetic field]]s.<ref name="cox2000"/>  Additionally, a number of [[spectral line]]s produced by [[interstellar gas]], particularly the [[hydrogen]] spectral line at 21 [[centimeter|cm]], are observable at radio wavelengths.<ref name="shu1982"/><ref name="cox2000"/>

A wide variety of objects are observable at radio wavelengths, including [[supernova]]e, [[interstellar gas]], [[pulsar]]s, and [[active galactic nuclei]].<ref name="shu1982"/><ref name="cox2000"/>

====Infrared astronomy====

[[Infrared astronomy]] studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible but shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the usual [[optical]] telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.

====Optical astronomy====

[[Optical astronomy]] is the oldest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a [[charge-coupled device]] or [[spectroscope]]s are the most common instruments used. The Earth's [[atmosphere]] interferes somewhat with optical observations, so [[adaptive optics]] and [[space telescope]]s are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e.

====Ultraviolet astronomy====

[[Ultraviolet astronomy]] is generally used to refer to observations at [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200 [[Ångstrom|Å]].<ref name="cox2000"/>   Light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.  Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue [[star]]s ([[O star]]s and [[B star]]s) that are very bright in this wave band.  This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys.  Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include [[planetary nebula]]e, [[supernova remnant]]s, and [[active galactic nuclei]].<ref name="cox2000"/> However, ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by [[interstellar dust]], and measurement of the ultraviolet light from objects need to be corrected for extinction.<ref name="cox2000"/>

====X-ray astronomy====

[[X-ray astronomy]] is the study of astronomical objects at X-ray wavelengths.  Typically, objects emit X-ray radiation as [[synchrotron emission]] (produced by electrons oscillating around magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases (called [[bremsstrahlung radiation]]) that is above 10<sup>7</sup> (10 million) [[Kelvin]], and thermal emission from thick gases (called [[blackbody radiation]]) that are above 10<sup>7</sup> Kelvin.<ref name="cox2000"/>  Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be done from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or spacecraft.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  Notable X-ray sources include [[X-ray binaries]], [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[elliptical galaxies]], [[clusters of galaxies]], and [[active galactic nuclei]].<ref name="cox2000"/>

====Gamma-ray astronomy====

[[Gamma ray astronomy]] is the study of astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] or by specialized telescopes called [[atmospheric Cherenkov telescope]]s.<ref name="cox2000"/>  The Cherenkov telescopes do not actually detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Most [[gamma-ray]] emitting sources are actually [[gamma-ray burst]]s, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away.  Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources.  These steady gamma-ray emitters include [[pulsar]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]] candidates such as [[active galactic nuclei]].<ref name="cox2000"/>

====Fields of observational astronomy not based on the electromagnetic spectrum====

Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. 

In [[neutrino astronomy]], astronomers use special underground facilities such as [[SAGE (ruSsian American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]], [[GALLEX]], and [[Kamioka II/III]] for detecting [[neutrino]]s.  These neutrinos originate primarily from the [[Sun]] but also from [[supernova]]e.<ref name="cox2000"/>

[[Cosmic ray]]s consisting of very high energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.{{citation needed}}  Additionally, some future neutrino detectors will also be sensitive to the neutrinos produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.<ref name="cox2000"/>

A few [[gravitational wave]] observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect.

===Subfield for specific astronomical objects===

====Solar astronomy====
{{main|Sun}}
The most frequently studied star is the [[Sun]], a typical main-sequence [[dwarf star]] of [[stellar class]] G2 V, and about 4.6 Gyr in age. The Sun is not considered a [[variable star]], but it does undergo  periodic changes in activity known as the [[sunspot cycle]]. This is an 11-year fluctuation in [[sunspot]] numbers. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.<ref name="solar FAQ">{{cite web | last = Johansson | first = Sverker | date = 2003-07-27 | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-solar.html | title = The Solar FAQ | publisher = Talk.Origins Archive | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref>

[[Image:Uvsun trace big.jpg|left|thumb|250px|An [[ultraviolet]] image of the Sun's active [[photosphere]] as viewed by the [[TRACE]] space telescope. ''[[NASA]] photo''.]]
The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity over the course of its life, increasing by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.<ref name="Environmental issues : essential primary sources.">{{cite web | last = Lerner & K.

The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the [[photosphere]]. Above this layer is a thin region known as the [[chromosphere]]. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, then by the super-heated [[corona]].

At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Above the core is the [[radiation zone]], where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. The outer layers form a [[convection zone]] where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas. It is believed that this convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sun spots.<ref name="solar FAQ" />

A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until it reaches the [[heliopause]]. This solar wind interacts with the [[magnetosphere]] of the [[Earth]] to create the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, as well as the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] where the lines of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] descend into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web | author = D.

====Planetary science====
{{main|Planetary science|Planetary geology}}
This astronomical field examines the assemblage of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as [[extrasolar planet]]s. The [[solar system]] has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.<ref name="geology">{{cite book | author=J.

This moving, swirling column of [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] (comparable to a terrestrial [[tornado]]) created the long, dark streak. ''[[NASA]] image''.]]
The solar system is subdivided into the inner planets, the [[asteroid belt]], and the outer planets. The inner [[terrestrial planet]]s consist of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], the [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]. The outer [[gas giant]] planets are [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].<ref name="planets">{{cite web | author = E. Grayzeck, D. R.

The planets were formed by a [[protoplanetary disk]] that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The [[radiation pressure]] of the [[solar wind]] then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many [[impact crater]]s on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided, the [[giant impact hypothesis|leading hypothesis]] for how the Moon was formed.<ref name="formation">{{cite web | last = Roberge | first = Aki | date = 1997-05-05 | url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/akir/Seminar/seminar.html | title = Planetary Formation and Our Solar System | publisher = Carnegie Institute of Washington&mdash;Department of Terrestrial Magnetism | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref>

Once a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials with different densities segregate within, during [[planetary differentiation]].  This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer surface. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own [[magnetic field]], which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.<ref>{{cite web | last = Roberge | first = Aki | date = 1998-04-21 | url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/akir/Seminar/internal.html | title = The Planets After Formation | publisher = Department of Terrestrial Magnetism | accessdate = 2006-08-23 }}</ref>

A planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, radioactive materials (''e.g.'' [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[Aluminum#Isotopes|<sup>26</sup>Al]]), or [[tidal acceleration|tidal heating]]. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as [[volcanism]] and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an [[atmosphere]] can also undergo surface [[erosion]] from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.<ref name="new solar system">{{cite book | editor=J.K. Beatty, C.C. Petersen, A. Chaikin | title=The New Solar System | publisher=Cambridge press | edition = 4th | year=1999 | id =ISBN 0-521-64587-5 }}</ref>

====Stellar astronomy====
[[Image:ant.nebula.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[Mz3|Ant planetary nebula]]. Ejecting gas from the dying central star shows symmetrical patterns unlike the chaotic patterns of ordinary explosions.]]
{{main|Star|Stellar astronomy}}
The study of [[star]]s and [[stellar evolution]] is fundamental to our understanding of the universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.

[[Star formation]] occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]].  When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a [[protostar]]. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger [[nuclear fusion]], thus creating a [[main-sequence star]].<ref name="sead">{{cite web | url=http://observe.arc.nasa.gov/nasa/space/stellardeath/stellardeath_intro.html | title = Stellar Evolution & Death | publisher = NASA Observatorium | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }}</ref>

The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it expends the hydrogen fuel in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to [[Stellar evolution|evolve]]. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature, so that the star both expands in size, and increases in core density. The resulting [[red giant]] enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of decreasing evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.

The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the [[Sun]] becoming core collapse [[supernova]]e; while smaller stars form [[planetary nebula]]e, and evolve into [[white dwarf]]s. The remnant of a supernova is a dense [[neutron star]], or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a [[black hole]].<ref name="Cambridge atlas">{{cite book | editor=Jean Audouze, Guy Israel | title=The Cambridge Atlas of Astronomy | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1994 | id=ISBN 0-521-43438-6 }}</ref> Close binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova.

====Galactic astronomy====
{{main|Galactic astronomy}}
[[Image:Milky Way Spiral Arms.png|250px|right|thumb|Observed structure of the Milky Way's spiral arms]]

Our [[solar system]] orbits within the [[Milky Way]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is a prominent member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.

In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, [[Stellar population|population II]] stars. The disk is surrounded by a [[Galactic spheroid|spheroid halo]] of older, [[population I]] stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as [[globular cluster]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ott | first = Thomas | date = 2006-08-24 | url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php | title = The Galactic Centre | publisher = Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Faulkner | first = Danny R. | title=The Role Of Stellar Population Types In The Discussion Of Stellar Evolution | journal=CRS Quarterly | year=1993 | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=174-180 | url=http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/30/30_1/StellarPop.html | accessdate=2006-09-08 }}</ref>

Between the stars lies the [[interstellar medium]], a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, [[molecular cloud]]s of [[Hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] and other elements create [[Star formation|star-forming]] regions. These begin as irregular [[dark nebula]]e, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the [[Jeans length]]) to form compact [[protostar]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hanes | first = Dave | date = 2006-08-24 | url=http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~hanes/p014/Notes/Topic_063.html | title = Star Formation; The Interstellar Medium | publisher = Queen's University | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an [[H II region]] of glowing gas and plasma. The [[Solar wind|stellar wind]] and supernova explosions from these stars eventually serve to disperse the cloud, often leaving behind one or more young [[open cluster]]s of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of  the Milky Way.

Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A [[dark matter halo]] appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Van den Bergh, Sidney | title=The Early History of Dark Matter | journal=Publications of the Astronomy Society of the Pacific | year=1999 | volume=111 | pages=657-660 | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/PASP/journal/issues/v111n760/990017/990017.html }}</ref>

====Extragalactic astronomy====
{{main|Extragalactic astronomy}}
The study of objects outside of our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of Galaxies]]; their morphology and [[Galaxy morphological classification|classification]]; and the examination of [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and the [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters of galaxies]]. The latter is important for the understanding of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].

[[Image:grav.lens1.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|260px|This image shows several blue, loop-shaped objects that are multiple images of the same galaxy, duplicated by the [[gravitational lens]] effect of the cluster of yellow galaxies near the middle of the photograph. The lens is produced by the cluster's gravitational field that bends light to magnify and distort the image of a more distant object.]]
Most galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into [[spiral galaxy|spiral]], [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and [[irregular galaxy|Irregular]] galaxies.<ref>{{cite web | last = Keel | first = Bill | date = 2006-08-01 | url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html | title = Galaxy Classification | publisher = University of Alabama | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an [[ellipse]]. The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust; few star-forming regions; and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may be formed through mergers of large galaxies.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation where massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] are spiral galaxies.

Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.

An active galaxy is a formation that is emitting a significant amount of its energy from a source other than stars, dust and gas; and is powered by a compact region at the core, usually thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.

A [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the [[radio]] portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit high-energy radiation include [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], [[Quasar]]s, and [[Blazar]]s. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html | title = Active Galaxies and Quasars | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized in a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the [[supercluster]]s. The collective matter is formed into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and walls, leaving large [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] in between.<ref name="evolving universe">{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Zeilik | title=Astronomy: The Evolving Universe | edition=8th | publisher=Wiley | year=2002 | id=ISBN 0-521-80090-0 }}</ref>

====Cosmology====
{{main|Physical cosmology}}

Cosmology could be considered the study of the universe as a whole.

Observations of the [[large-scale structure]] of the [[universe]], a branch known as [[physical cosmology]], have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the [[big bang]], wherein our universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] over the course of 13.7 Gyr to its present condition. The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] in 1965.

In the course of this expansion, the universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the universe experienced a very rapid [[cosmic inflation]], which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] produced the elemental abundance of the early universe.

When the first atoms formed, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding universe then underwent a dark age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.<ref name="cosmology 101">{{cite web | last = Hinshaw | first = Gary | date = 2006-07-13 | url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html | title = Cosmology 101: The Study of the Universe | publisher = NASA WMAP | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref>

A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the [[Population III stars|earliest stars]]. These massive stars triggered the [[reionization]] process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early universe.

Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters]] of galaxies, then into larger-scale [[supercluster]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html | title = Galaxy Clusters and Large-Scale Structure | publisher = University of Cambridge | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

Fundamental to the structure of the universe is the existence of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. These are now thought to be the dominant components, forming 96% of the density of the universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.<ref>{{cite web | last = Preuss | first = Paul | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html | title = Dark Energy Fills the Cosmos | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Berkeley Lab | accessdate = 2006-09-08 }}</ref>

===Interdisciplinary studies===
{{seealso|Cosmochemistry}}
Astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. These include:
* [[Astrobiology]]: the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the universe.
* [[Archaeoastronomy]]: the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] evidence.
* [[Astrochemistry]]: the study of the [[chemical]]s found in outer space, usually in [[Molecular cloud|molecular gas cloud]]s, and their formation, interaction and destruction. As such, it represents an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and [[chemistry]].

==Amateur astronomy==
{{main|Amateur astronomy}}
[[Image:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment, and can hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]
Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/ | title = The Americal Meteor Society | accessdate = 2006-08-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Jerry  | last=Lodriguss | url=http://www.astropix.com/ | title = Catching the Light: Astrophotography | accessdate = 2006-08-24 }}</ref>

Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]] who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the [[1930s]]. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (''e.g.'' the [[One-Mile Telescope]]).<ref>{{cite web | author=F.

Amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy. Indeed, it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.

==Major questions in astronomy==
{{seealso|Unsolved problems in physics}}
Although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.
