The '''Republic of Estonia''', or '''Estonia''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Eesti Vabariik'' or ''Eesti'') is a country in [[Northern Europe]] and a member state of [[European Union]] since [[2004]]. It is separated from [[Finland]] in the north by the narrow [[Gulf of Finland]] and from [[Sweden]] in the west by the middle part of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its coastline is 3794 km long. Estonia has land borders with its fellow [[Baltic countries|Baltic country]] [[Latvia]] (339 km) to the south and [[Russia]] (229 km) to the east.  

== History ==
{{main|History of Estonia}}
According to scientific theory, human settlement in Estonia became possible when the ice, from the last [[Ice Age|glacial era]], melted away 11,000–13,000 years ago.  The oldest known settlement in Estonia was located on the [[Pärnu|Pärnu River]], near the town of [[Sindi]] (Pulli settlement, by village Pulli - on right bank of Pärnu River). According to radiocarbon dating it is settled 9500 years ago at the middle of the 8th millennium BC.  

Estonia was first [[christianization|christianised]] when the [[Germany|German]] "[[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]" and [[Denmark]] conquered the land by [[1227]]. Subsequent foreign powers that controlled Estonia at various times included Denmark, [[Sweden]], [[Poland]] and finally ([[1710]] de facto, [[1721]] de jure, see [[Treaty of Nystad]]) [[Russia]].  However, the upper classes and the higher middle class remained primarily [[Baltic German]] until roughly 1918. During and immediately after [[World War II]], the remaining Germans were forced out by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and, later, [[Stalin]].

Following the collapse of [[Imperial Russia]] after the [[October Revolution]], Estonia declared itself an independent republic on [[February 24]], [[1918]]. After the [[Estonian Liberation War]] and [[Treaty of Tartu]] signed in [[February 2]], [[1920]] Estonia maintained this independence for twenty-two years, and the very same parliamentary government was reinstated in [[1992]], after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. It included a parliament called ''Riigikogu'', elected by all Estonian citizens aged 18 or above. ''Riigikogu'' was disbanded in [[1934]] and the country was ruled by decree by [[president]] [[Konstantin Päts]] until the parliamentary elections in [[1938]].

The country was occupied by Soviet troops in [[June]] [[1940]], as a consequence of the [[1939]] [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Many of its political and intellectual leaders were killed or repressed, including Estonia's first president Konstantin Päts, who was deported to [[Russia]]. The country was occupied by the German [[Third Reich]] from [[1941]] to [[1944]], when Soviet forces reconquered it. Estonia regained its independence on [[August 20]], [[1991]], with the [[Singing Revolution]] and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. [[August 20]] is now a national holiday in Estonia.

The last Russian troops left on [[August 31]], [[1994]], and Estonia joined [[NATO]] on [[March 29]], [[2004]] and the [[European Union]] on [[May 1]], [[2004]].

Estonia signed a border agreement with [[Russia]] on [[May 18]], [[2005]], slightly redefining the border they had been using since [[1991]], which the [[Riigikogu]], the Estonian parliament, ratified on [[June 20]], [[2005]]. However, Russia took exception to Estonia's preamble to the law, which makes references to the Estonian state's uninterrupted legal continuity during the Soviet period and indirect references to the [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|Soviet occupation]] of Estonia and announced that it is revoking its signature and that it desires to restart negotiations with Estonia.   

Estonia has said that there is no need to renegotiate the border and that it has no land claims against Russia. 

=== Etymology ===
After Estonia regained independence in 1991, a public debate ensued on the chosen [[English language]] name for Estonia. The ending ''–onia'' in the name ''Estonia'' (earlier also ''Esthonia'') is of [[Latin]] origin. Many Estonians tend to identify more with Northern Europe, and would prefer the country to have a more Nordic-sounding name. The most widely-known of these alternative English language names is ''Estland'', which is in fact the name for the country in most other [[Germanic languages]] (e.g., [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).

== Politics ==
[[Image:Estonian parliament building.jpg|thumb|right|256px|The Estonian Parliament building in Tallinn]]
{{main|Politics of Estonia}}
Estonia is a [[constitution]]al [[democracy]], with a president elected by its unicameral [[parliament]] (elections every four years). The government or the [[executive branch]] is formed by the prime minister, nominated by the president, and a total of 14 ministers. The government is appointed by the president after approval by the parliament.

[[Legislative]] power lies with the unicameral parliament, the [[Riigikogu]] or State Assembly, which consists of 101 seats. Members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The supreme [[judiciary]] court is the National Court or ''Riigikohus'', with 19 justices whose chairman is appointed by the parliament for life on nomination by the president.

[[Internet voting]] has already been used in local elections in Estonia, and the lawmakers in Estonia have authorized internet voting for parliamentary elections as well. [http://news.com.com/Estonia+pulls+off+nationwide+Net+voting/2100-1028_3-5898115.html (see COM)].

== Counties ==
{{main|Counties of Estonia}}
Estonia numbers 15 main administrative subdivisions. Due to the geographical and demographic size of these subdivisions, they are to be considered counties rather than states (Estonian: pl. ''maakonnad''; sg. - ''maakond''). Here is a list of them:
[[Image:Estonia counties.png|thumb|400px|Counties of Estonia]]
*[[Harju County]] (Estonian: ''Harjumaa'')
*[[Hiiu County]] (Estonian: ''Hiiumaa'')
*[[Ida-Viru County]] (Estonian: ''Ida-Virumaa'')
*[[Järva County]] (Estonian: ''Järvamaa'')
*[[Jõgeva County]] (Estonian: ''Jõgevamaa'')
*[[Lääne County]] (Estonian: ''Läänemaa'')
*[[Lääne-Viru County]] (Estonian: ''Lääne-Virumaa'')
*[[Pärnu County]] (Estonian: ''Pärnumaa'')

*[[Valga County]] (Estonian: ''Valgamaa'')
*[[Viljandi County]] (Estonian: ''Viljandimaa'')
*[[Võru County]] (Estonian: ''Võrumaa'')

== Geography ==
[[Image:En-map.png|right|Map of Estonia]]
{{main|Geography of Estonia}}

Estonia lies on the eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] on the level northwestern part of the rising east European platform between 57.3° and 59.5° N and 21.5° and 28.1° E. Average elevation reaches only 50&nbsp;[[metre]]s (164&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and the country's highest point is the [[Suur Munamägi]] in the southeast at 318&nbsp;metres (1,043&nbsp;ft).

[[Oil shale]] (or kukersite) and [[limestone]] deposits, along with forests which cover 47% of the land, play key economic roles in this generally resource-poor country. Estonia boasts over [[List of lakes in Estonia|1,400 lakes]] (most very small, with the largest, [[Lake Peipus]], (Peipsi in Estonian) being 3,555 km²; 1372&nbsp;[[square mile|sq. mi]]), numerous [[bogs]], and 3,794 [[kilometer]]s (2,357&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of coastline marked by numerous bays, straits, and inlets. The number of islands and islets is estimated at some 1,500, with two of them large enough to constitute their own counties, [[Saaremaa]] and [[Hiiumaa]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Estonia}}

As a member of the [[European Union]], Estonia is part of the world's largest economic zone. In [[1999]], Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained independence in [[1991]], largely because of the impact of the August [[1998]] Russian financial crisis. Estonia joined the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in November 1999 — the second Baltic state to join — and continued its [[EU]] accession talks. [[Privatization]] of energy, [[telecommunications]], railways, and other state-owned companies is a continuing process. With assistance from the European Union, the [[World Bank]] and the [[Nordic Bank]], Estonia completed most of its preparations for EU membership by the end of [[2002]] and now has one of the strongest economies of the new member states of the European Union, which Estonia joined on [[1 May]] [[2004]]. The Estonian economy is growing fast, partly due to a number of [[Scandinavia]]n companies relocating their routine operations and [[Russia]]n oil transit using Estonian ports. Estonia has a strong [[information technology]] (IT) sector. [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP PPP per capita]] is at $17,672, the highest among the [[Baltic states]].

In 1994, Estonia became among the first in the world to adopt a [[flat tax]], with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of the income a person makes. In January 2005 the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%. A subsequent reduction to 23% followed in January 2006. In the following years the income tax rate will be decreased by 1% annually to reach 20% by January 2009.

Since [[January 1]], [[2000]], companies have not had to pay income tax on re-invested income. However, tax is due on profit distributions (incl. hidden distributions) at a rate of 24%. Despite the fact that only the moment of taxation was shifted from earning profits to their distribution, leaving the rest of the corporate taxation system mostly unchanged, the current legislation is said to be in violation of one of the fundamental freedoms of the European Union - free movement of capital. Estonia is to remove this hindrance by January 2009 when the temporary derogation expires.

In June 1992, Estonia replaced the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] with its own freely convertible currency, the [[Kroon]] (EEK). A currency board was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate at 8 EEK for 1 DEM. When Germany introduced the [[Euro]] the peg was changed to 15.6466 Kroon for 1 Euro.
The Estonian government is intending to adopt the [[Euro]] as the country's currency on [[1 January]] [[2007]], and finalised the design of Estonia's Euro coins in late 2004.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Estonia}}
Indigenous Estonian-speaking ethnic Estonians constitute nearly 70 percent of the population. First and second generation immigrants from various parts of the former Soviet Union, mainly [[Russia]] comprise most of the remaining 30 percent. The latter, mostly Russian-speaking ethnic minorities reside predominantly in the capital city (Tallinn) and the industrial urban areas in northeastern Estonia ([[Ida-Virumaa]] county). There is also a small group of [[Finland|Finnish]] descent.

The country's official language is [[Estonian language|Estonian]], which is closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. [[Russian language|Russian]] is also widely spoken as a secondary language by 30-70 year old ethnic Estonians because Russian was a compulsory second language in school during the Soviet era. Younger people, born at the end of or following the Soviet era, can usually speak [[English language|English]], having learned it as their first foreign language.

Estonia has the second highest [[HIV]] adult prevalence rate in Europe after [[Ukraine]] (1.1% in 2001).

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the most recent national census taken in 2003, the population of Estonia comprised the following self-reported ethnic groups:
* 68.4% [[Estonians]]
* 25.7% [[Russians]] 
* 2.1% [[Ukrainians]]
* 1.2% [[Belarusians]]
* 0.8% [[Finns]]
* 1.7% others

=== Religion ===
[[Image:FL-Tallinn.jpg|thumb|220px|Tallinn, churches in the background]]
The predominant religion of indigenous ethnic Estonians is the [[Christianity|Christian]] belief in the form the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Evangelical Lutheran]] confession, however less than a quarter of ethnic Estonians define themselves as active believers at present. Most believers amongst the Russian minority are [[Eastern Orthodox]]. The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] has since 1920s recognised a separate national [[Estonian Orthodox Church]], which has led to strained relations with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which claimed sole authority over Orthodox believers in the country during the period of Soviet rule.

Today, over 31% of the adult population are active followers of a particular faith, and they are made up of:
* 15% [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]]
* 14% [[Orthodox]]
* 0.5% [[Baptist]]s
* 0.5% [[Roman Catholic]]s

There are also a number of smaller Protestant and [[Jewish]] groups, as well as some [[neopagans]] who revere the local ancient deity [[Taara]]. There are nearly 10,000 [[Islam in Estonia|Muslims]] in Estonia.
