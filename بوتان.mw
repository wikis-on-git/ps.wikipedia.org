The '''Kingdom of Bhutan''' ({{IPA2|buː'tɑːn}} {{Audio|Bhutan.ogg|Listen}}) is a [[landlocked]] [[South Asia]]n nation situated between [[India]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The entire country is mountainous except for an 8-10 mile (13-16&nbsp;km) wide strip of subtropical plains in the extreme south which is intersected by valleys known as the [[Duars]].  The elevation gain from the subtropical plains to the glacier-covered [[Himalaya]]n heights exceeds 23,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (7,000&nbsp;[[metre|m]]). Its traditional economy is based on [[forestry]], [[animal husbandry]] and [[subsistence agriculture]] however these account for less than 50% of a GDP now that Bhutan has become an exporter of [[hydroelectricity]]{{ref|economy}}.  [[Cash crops]], [[tourism]], and [[development aid]] (the latter mostly from India) are also significant. Population estimates range from 734,000, to 2.23 million{{ref|population}}. [[Thimphu]] is the capital and largest town.

Bhutan is one of the most isolated nations in the world; foreign influences and tourism are heavily regulated by the government to preserve its traditional [[Tibetan Buddhist]] culture. Most Bhutanese follow either the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] or the [[Nyingmapa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism. The official language is [[Dzongkha]] (lit. "the language of the [[dzong]]"). Bhutan is often described as the last surviving refuge of traditional Himalayan Buddhist culture.  Non-Buddhists complain of human rights violations.  Approximately 100,000 ethnic [[Nepali]] (who are generally [[Hindu]]) were exiled from the south of the country in the late [[1980s]] in the wake of supposed pro-democracy demonstrations. A large number of them were later found to be immigrants from Nepal who had been living in Bhutan illegally.

Bhutan has been a [[monarchy]] since [[1907]]. The different [[dzongkhag]]s were united under the leadership of Trongsa Penlop. The current king, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuk]], has made some moves toward constitutional government.

The origins of the name ''Bhutan'' are unclear; historians have suggested that it may have originated in variations of the [[Sanskrit]] words ''Bhota-ant'' (the end of Bhot – a variation of the Indian Sanskrit word "[[Buddha]]" meaning enlightened, another word for [[Tibet]]), or ''Bhu-uttan'' (highlands). The word ''Bhutan'' as a name for the country dates from the late [[19th century]].

The Dzongkha (and Tibetan) name for the country is ''Druk Yul'' ("Land of the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]]"). 

Historically, Bhutan was known by many names, such as ''Lho Mon'' (Southern Land of Darkness), ''Lho Tsendenjong'' (Southern Land of the [[Sandalwood]]), and ''Lhomen Khazhi'' (Southern Land of Four Approaches).

== تاريخ ==

{{main|History of Bhutan}}
Stone tools, weapons, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as [[20th century BC|2000 BC]]. Historians have theorised that the state of ''Lhomon'' (literally, "southern darkness"), or ''Monyul'' ("Dark Land", a reference to the [[Monpa]] – the aboriginal peoples of Bhutan) may have existed between [[500s BC|500 BC]] and [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;[[600]]. The names ''Lhomon Tsendenjong'' ([[Sandalwood]] Country), and ''Lhomon Khashi'', or Southern Mon (country of four approaches) have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles. 

The earliest transcribed event in Bhutan was the passage of the [[Buddhist]] saint Padmasambhava (also called [[Guru Rinpoche]]) in the [[8th century]]. Bhutan's early history is unclear, because most of the records were destroyed after fire ravaged [[Punakha]], the ancient capital in [[1827]]. By the [[10th century]], Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various sub-sects of Buddhism emerged which were patronised by the various Mongol and Tibetan overlords. After the decline of the Mongols in the [[14th century]], these sub-sects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the Drukpa sub-sect by the [[16th century]]. 

[[دوتنه:TrongsaDzong.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Trongsa]] Dzong]]
Until the early [[17th century]], Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring [[fiefdom]]s until unified by the [[Tibetan]] lama and military leader [[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal]]. To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable ''[[dzong]]'' (fortresses), and [[promulgation|promulgated]] a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralised control. Many such ''dzong'' still exist. After Namgyal's death in [[1652]], Bhutan fell into anarchy. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Tibetans attacked Bhutan in [[1710]], and again in [[1730]] with the help of the [[Mongols]]. Both assaults were successfully thwarted, and an [[armistice]] was signed in 1759. 
[[دوتنه:Bt-map.png|thumb|left|250px|Map of Bhutan]]
In the [[18th century]], the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of [[Cooch Behar]] to the south. In [[1772]], Cooch Behar appealed to the [[British East India Company]] who assisted them in ousting the Bhutanese, and later in attacking Bhutan itself in [[1774]]. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the British were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the [[Duar War]] ([[1864]]–[[1865]]), a confrontation over who would control the [[Bengal]] [[Duars]]. After Bhutan lost the war, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] was signed between [[British India]] and Bhutan. As part of the [[reparation]]s, the Duars were ceded to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in exchange for a rent of Rs.&nbsp;50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.

During the [[1870s]], power struggles between the rival valleys of [[Paro]] and [[Trongsa]] led to [[civil war]] in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''ponlop'' (governor) of [[Tongsa]]. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions in the period [[1882]]–[[1885]].

In [[1907]], an epochal year for the country, [[Ugyen Wangchuck]] was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by an assembly of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families. The British government promptly recognised the new monarchy, and in [[1910]] Bhutan came under the [[suzerainty]] of the British crown in exchange for political autonomy. After [[India]] gained [[Independence of India|independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] on [[August 15]], [[1947]], [[Princely states|kingdoms]] such as Bhutan were given the option to remain independent or to join the Indian Union. Bhutan chose to remain independent, and on [[August 8]], [[1949]], Bhutan's independence was recognised by India.

After the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]] entered [[Tibet]] in [[1951]], Bhutan sealed its northern frontier and improved bilateral ties with India. To reduce the risk of Chinese encroachment, Bhutan began a modernisation program that was largely sponsored by [[India]]. In [[1953]], King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] established the country's legislature – a 130-member [[National Assembly]] – to promote a more democratic form of governance. In [[1965]], he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in [[1968]] he formed a Cabinet. In [[1971]], Bhutan was admitted to the [[United Nations]], having held observer status for three years. In July [[1972]], [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] ascended to the throne at the age of 16 after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck. 

[[دوتنه:Wangchuck-India.jpg|thumb|200px|King Jigme Singye Wangchuck]]
Government decrees promulgated in the [[1980s]] sought to preserve Bhutan's cultural identity in a "one nation, one people" policy called ''driglam namzha'' (national customs and etiquette). For example, a  Bhutanese-derived national dress is required of all Bhutanese, even of the recent immigrants from [[Nepal]]. Nepali activists have claimed that Nepali-language education has also been restricted on grounds of national unity, however these claims have proven false.

Such policies were criticized at first by human rights groups as well as Bhutan's [[Nepalese]] economic migrant community, who perceive the policy to be directed against them. From the perspective of Bhutanese, the issue is one of preserving a Himalayan Buddhist culture and way of life (which has been completely destroyed in nearby [[Sikkim]] by an onslaught of over immigration by very same ethnic Nepalese). To the Nepali immigrants, the Bhutanese are clinging to power at the expense of human rights, pluralism, and democratic principles. 

Simmering tensions between ethnic Nepali and Bhutanese communities were exacerbated in the late 1980s after the government moved to implement the ''1985 Citizenship Act'', which provided that only those Nepalese immigrants who could show they had resided in Bhutan since 1958, as proved by being able to show documents prior to 1958, would be deemed citizens of Bhutan. This led to the setting up of numerous organisations to protest against what was seen as an injustice against resident Nepalis. Matters reached a head in 1991 after protests by the Nepali community led to violence, leaving 300 dead and 2,000 under arrest. After protests by the government of Nepal, the Bhutanese government released most of those arrested. However, the issue of expatriate Nepalis remains unresolved, with at least 100,000 living in [[UNHCR]] camps in [[Nepal]] and [[Sikkim]].

In [[1998]], King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] introduced significant political reforms, transferring most of his powers to the [[Prime Minister]] and allowing for impeachment of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly. In late [[2003]], the [[Royal Bhutan Army|Bhutanese army]] launched a large-scale operation to flush out anti-India insurgents who were operating training camps in southern Bhutan. 

A new [[constitution]] has been presented in early [[2005]], which will be put up for ratification by a [[referendum]] before coming into force. In [[December 2005]], King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] announced that he would step down as King of Bhutan in [[2008]]. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck said he would be succeeded by his son, the crown prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. A group comprised of ethnic Nepalese claiming to be Bhutanese exiles, have criticized the constitution saying that the king is trying to overshadow the refugees problem in the country by introducing "limited democracy".

{{main|Geography of Bhutan}}
[[دوتنه:Bhutan topo en.jpg|thumb|250px|Topographic map of Bhutan]]
The northern region consists of an arc of glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over 23,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] 7,000&nbsp;[[metres|m]] above sea level; the highest point is claimed to be the [[Kula Kangri]], at 24,780&nbsp;feet (7,553&nbsp;m), but detailed topographic studies claim Kula Kangri is wholly in [[Tibet]] and modern Chinese measurements claim that [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which has the distinction of being the [[highest unclimbed mountain]] in the world, is higher at 24,835&nbsp;feet (7,570&nbsp;m). Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide [[pasture]] for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds. 
The [[Black Mountains]] in central Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems: the [[Mo Chhu]] and the [[Drangme Chhu]]. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between 4,900 feet and 8,900 feet (1,500&nbsp;m and 2,700&nbsp;m) above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan's forest production. The [[Torsa]], [[Raidak]], [[Sankosh]], and [[Manas]] are the main rivers of Bhutan, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands. 
[[دوتنه:Bhutan landscape.jpg|thumb|250px|Terraced farming in the [[Punakha]] valley.]]
In the south, the [[Shiwalik Hills]] are covered with dense, [[deciduous]] forests, [[alluvial]] lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around 4,900 feet (1,500&nbsp;m) above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical Duars plain. Most of the Duars is located in India, although a 6–9&nbsp;mile (10–15&nbsp;km) wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts: the northern and the southern Duars. The northern Duars, which abuts the Himalayan foothills, has rugged, sloping terrain and dry, [[porous]] soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy [[savannah]] grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains, empty into the [[Brahmaputra]] river in India. Over 70% of Bhutan is forested. 
The climate in Bhutan varies with altitude, from subtropical in the south to [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the highlands and [[polar climate|polar-type]] climate, with year-round snow, in the north. Bhutan experiences five distinct seasons: [[summer]], [[monsoon]], [[autumn]], [[winter]] and [[spring (season)|spring]]. Western Bhutan has the heavier monsoon rains; southern Bhutan has hot humid summers and cool winters; central and eastern Bhutan is temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters. {{inote|Library of Congress|Geography}}

{{main|Economy of Bhutan}}
[[دوتنه:Nu10Face.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Ngultrum]] is the currency of Bhutan and its value is pegged to the Indian rupee.]]
Bhutan's economy is one of the world's smallest and least developed, and is based on [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and the sale of [[hydroelectric power]] to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for more than 90% of the population. Agrarian practices consist largely of [[subsistence farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Handicrafts are a small cottage industry and a source of income for many. The sculpting of religious figurines is a popular occupation, and gilded [[Buddha]] statues and Buddhist saints are sold to tourists. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads, and other [[infrastructure]], difficult and expensive. This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has never been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. Bhutan currently does not have a [[rail transport|railway system]], though [[Indian Railways]] plans to link up southern Bhutan with its vast network under an agreement signed in [[January 2005]].{{ref|IR}} Historically, there have been well patronised trading routes from the Tibetan plateau to the Indian subcontinent through Bhutan, but haulage has been limited to human porters and livestock. The industrial sector is minimal, production being of the [[cottage industry|cottage-industry]] type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian contract labour. Agricultural produce includes rice, corn, root crops, citrus, food grains, dairy products and eggs. Industries include [[cement]], [[wood]] products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages and [[calcium carbide]].{{inote|CIA factbook|CIA-1}}

Bhutan's currency, the [[ngultrum]], is pegged to the [[Indian Rupee]]. The rupee is also accepted as [[legal tender]] in the country. Incomes of over [[Ngultrum|Nu]]&nbsp;100,000 [[per annum]] are taxed, but very few wage and salary earners qualify. Bhutan's inflation rate was estimated at about 3% in 2003. Bhutan has a [[Gross Domestic Product]] of around [[US Dollar|USD]] 2.913 billion (adjusted to [[Purchasing Power Parity]]), making it the 162nd largest economy in the world. Per capita income is around $1,400 (€1,170), ranked 124th. Government revenues total €122 million ($146 million), though expenditures amount to €127 million ($152 million). 60%{{inote|CIA factbook|CIA-economy}} of the budget expenditure, however, is financed by India's Ministry of External Affairs.{{ref|MEA}} Bhutan's exports, principally electricity, [[cardamom]], [[gypsum]], [[timber]], handicrafts, cement, fruit, precious stones and [[spices]], total €128 million ($154 million) (2000 est.). Imports, however, total €164 million ($196 million), leading to a trade deficit. Main items imported include [[fuel]] and [[lubricant]]s, [[grain]], [[machinery]], vehicles, fabrics and [[rice]].  Bhutan's main export partner is India, accounting for 87.9% of its export goods. [[Bangladesh]] (4.6%) and the [[Philippines]] (2%) are the other two top export partners. As its border with Tibet is closed, trade between Bhutan and China is now almost non-existent. Bhutan's import partners include India (71.3%), [[Japan]] (7.8%) and [[Austria]] (3%).{{inote|CIA factbook|CIA-2}}

In a response to accusations in 1987 by a journalist from [[United Kingdom|UK's]] ''[[Financial Times]]'' that the pace of development in Bhutan was slow, the King said that "[[Gross National Happiness]] is more important than Gross National Product." {{ref|yoga}} This statement appears to have presaged recent findings by western economic psychologists, including 2002 Nobel Laureate [[Daniel Kahneman]], that questions the link between levels of income and happiness. It signalled his commitment to building an economy that is appropriate for Bhutan's unique culture, based on Buddhist spiritual values, and has served as a unifying vision for the economy.

[[دوتنه:Takstan-monastery.jpg|250px|thumb|The Takstang Monastery. Buddhism is the state religion and plays an important part in the nation's politics.]]

The question of whether Bhutan is a [[sovereign]] country is a difficult one. Bhutan was treated as a [[suzerainty]] by the British [[Raj]], which set up a [[monarchy]] and allowed it to administer Bhutan's internal affairs. Foreign and defense policy, however, was decided by the British. In 1949, after [[Indian independence]], Bhutan and India agreed to a ten-article, perpetual treaty which effectively continued the relationship, but with India taking the place of the United Kingdom as the imperial power. That is, India agreed not to interfere in Bhutan's internal relations, while Bhutan agreed "to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations" (Article 2). The treaty also established free trade and full extradition between the two countries. 

Bhutan's [[head of state]] is the [[Kings of Bhutan|Druk Gyalpo]] ("Dragon King"), presently [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]]. Although his title is hereditary, he can be removed by a two-thirds majority vote by the [[parliament]], the [[unicameral]] National Assembly, or ''[[Tshogdu]]''. The 154-seat National Assembly is composed of locally elected town representatives (105), religious representatives (12), and members nominated by the king (37), all of whom serve a three-year term. [[Suffrage]] in Bhutan is unique in that each family-unit, rather than individual, has one vote. 

In 1998, the monarch's [[executive (government)|executive]] powers were transferred to the council of ministers, or [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] (''[[Lhengye Shungtsog]]''). Candidates for the council of ministers are elected by the National Assembly for a fixed, five-year term, and must be a part of the legislative assembly. The cabinet is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Bhutan|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]]. The post of Prime Minister rotates each year between the five candidates who secured the highest number of votes. Recently, a new constitution that includes provision for a two-party democratic system was unveiled after four years of preparation. This constitution is likely to be put to the people in a [[referendum]] at the end of 2005; at the behest of the monarch, the referendum proposes a significant reduction in his powers. 

In Bhutan's [[judiciary|judicial]] system, the monarch is the final [[appeals court|court of appeal]] (the "Supreme Court of Appeal"). The [[Royal High Court of Bhutan]] is the highest court in the country. The Royal High Court has [[original jurisdiction]] over the 20 districts of the nation. Bhutan's legal system is superficially based on [[Law in India|Indian law]] and [[English common law]], but is in fact largely informal. Judicial appointments are made by the monarch, and may be recalled by him at any time.

== Districts ==
{{main|Districts of Bhutan}}
For administrative purposes, Bhutan is divided into four ''dzongdey'' (administrative zones). Each ''dzongdey'' is further divided into ''[[dzongkhag]]'' (districts). There are 20 ''dzongkhag'' in Bhutan. Large dzongkhags are further divided into subdistricts known as ''[[dungkhag]]''. At the basic level, groups of villages form a constituency called ''gewog'' and are administered by a ''gup'', who is elected by the people.

The [[Royal Bhutan Army]] is Bhutan's military service. It includes the [[Royal Bodyguard]] and the [[Royal Bhutan Police]]. Membership is voluntary, and the minimum age for recruitment is 18. The standing army numbers about 6,000 and is trained by the [[Indian Army]].{{ref|army}} It has an annual budget of about US$13.7 million—1.8% of the GDP.

India handles most of Bhutan's foreign affairs by way of conducting formal communications to and from other countries as Bhutan has a shortage of diplomatic personnel. {{inote|Library of Congress|Foreign Relations}} Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 22 countries, including the [[European Union]], with missions in India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Thailand]] and [[Kuwait]]. It has two [[United Nations|UN]] missions, one in [[New York City|New York]] and one in [[Geneva]]. Only India and Bangladesh have residential embassies in Bhutan, while Thailand has consulate office in Bhutan. 

By a longstanding treaty, Indian and Bhutanese citizens may travel to each other's countries without a [[passport]] or [[visa (document)|visa]]. Bhutanese citizens may also work in India without legal restriction. Bhutan does not have formal diplomatic ties with its northern neighbour, China, although exchanges of visits at various levels between the two have significantly increased in the recent past. The first bilateral agreement between China and Bhutan was signed in 1998, and Bhutan has also set up consulates in [[Macau]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Bhutan’s border with China is largely undemarcated and thus disputed in some places. {{ref|China}}

In late 2005, Bhutan claimed that Chinese soldiers were building roads and bridges within Bhutanese territory. Bhutanese Foreign Minister [[Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk|Khandu Wangchuk]] took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in Bhutanese parliament. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People's Republic of China has said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides continue to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute {{ref|invade}}; an Indian intelligence officer has also said that a Chinese delegation in Bhutan told the Bhutanese that they were overreacting. The Bhutanese newspaper ''Kuensel'' has said that China might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border. {{ref|alarm}}

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Bhutan}}
[[دوتنه:Bhutan man.jpg|thumb|200px|The dominant ethnic group is of Tibetan / Tibeto-Burman ancestry; Ethnic Nepalis migrants form the majority in the southern part of the country.]]

The population of Bhutan, once estimated at several million, has now been officially downgraded by the Bhutanese government to 750,000, after a census in the early nineties. Some  Nepali activists claim that the downgrade was motivated by a desire to minimise the proportion of immigrant ethnic Nepali population. However most believe that the population was artificially inflated in the seventies because of an earlier perception that nations with populations of less than a million would not be admitted to the [[United Nations]].

The population density, 45 per square kilometer (117/sq.&nbsp;mi), disguises the fact that most of Bhutan's land is unusable under present economic conditions. Bhutan's population is concentrated in the towns, in the southern plains, and in valleys where agriculture is feasible. Over half of the people live in the central highlands of Bhutan, and 40 percent live in the southern plains bordering India. The remaining 10 percent are dispersed in the northern mountains and in the eastern tracts. Ninety-two percent of the population live in rural settlements. The largest town is the capital, [[Thimphu]], which has a population of 50,000.

Among the Bhutanese people, several principal ethnic groups may be distinguished. The dominant group are the Ngalongs, a Buddhist group based in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet. Much the same could be said of the [[Sharchop]]s ("Easterners"), who are associated with the eastern part of Bhutan (but who traditionally follow the [[Nyingmapa]] rather than the official [[Drukpa Kagyu]] form of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]). These two groups together are  called [[Bhutanese]]. The remainder of the population consist of ethnic Nepalese, most of whom are Hindu (with a small Muslim minority). 

The national language is [[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]], one of 53 languages in the [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] language family. The script, here called ''Chhokey'' ("Dharma Language"), is identical with the Tibetan script. The government classifies 19 related Tibetan languages as [[dialect]]s of Dzongkha. [[Lepcha]] is spoken in parts of western Bhutan; [[Tshangla]], a close relative of Dzongkha, is widely spoken in the eastern parts. The [[Nepali language]] is widely spoken in the south (though the government forbids its being taught as a second language). [[Ethnologue]] lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan, all of them in the [[Tibeto-Burman]] family, except Nepali, an [[Indo-Iranian language]]. The languages of Bhutan are still not well-characterized, and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar. [[English language|English]] now has official status as well.

The [[literacy|literacy rate]] is only 42.2% (56.2% of males and 28.1% of females). People 14 years old and younger comprise 39.1%, while people between 15 and 59 comprise 56.9%, and those over 60 are only 4%. The country has a median age of 20.4 years. Bhutan has a [[life expectancy]] of 62.2 years (61 for males and 64.5 for females) according to the latest data from the [[World Bank]]. There are 1,070 males to every 1,000 females in the country.{{inote|CIA factbook|CIA-4}}

{{main|Culture of Bhutan}}

Bhutan remains one of the most secluded nations in the world, and foreigners are not permitted to travel to many of its areas to minimise the effects of tourism on the local culture.  In contrast to Nepal, which is well-known as a budget travel destination, Bhutan attempts to limit tourism to group tourists willing to pay upwards of US$100 per day. 

The traditional dress for Ngalong and Sharchop men is the ''[[gho]]'', a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the ''[[kera]]''. Women wear an ankle-length dress, the ''[[kira (dress)|kira]]'', which is clipped at one shoulder and tied at the waist. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, which is worn underneath the outer layer. Social status and class determine the texture, colours, and decorations that embellish the garments. Scarves and shawls are also indicators of social standings, as Bhutan has traditionally been a [[feudal]] society. Earrings are worn by females. Controversially, Bhutanese law now requires these Tibetan-style garments for all Bhutanese citizens—including the Nepalese, who are not of Tibetan stock. 

[[Rice]], and increasingly [[maize|corn]], are the staple foods of the country. The diet in the hills is rich in protein because of the consumption of meat — chiefly [[poultry]], [[yak]] and [[beef]]. Soups of meat, rice, and dried vegetables spiced with chilis and cheese are a favourite meal during the cold seasons.  Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, despite the scarcity of milk (becasue all milk is turned to butter and cheese). Popular beverages include [[butter tea]], tea, locally brewed rice wine and [[beer]]. Bhutan is the only country in the world to have [[smoking ban|banned tobacco smoking]] and the sale of [[tobacco]].

[[دوتنه:Bhutan archery.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Archery is the national sport of Bhutan and competitions are held regularly.]]. Bhutan's national sport is [[archery]], and competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standards not only in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. The are two targets placed over 100 yards apart and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event and competitions are organised between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There are usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing cheerleaders comprising of the wives and supporters of the participating teams. Attempts to distract an opponent includes standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. 

Another traditional sport is the ''[[digor]]'', which can be best described as [[shot put]] combined with horseshoe throwing. [[Football (soccer)|Soccer]] is an increasingly popular sport. ''[[Rigsagar]]'' is the new emergent style of popular music, played on a a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards, and dates back to the early 1990s; it shows the influence of Indian popular music, a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences. Traditional genres include the ''[[zhungdra]]'' and ''[[boedra]]''. 

Characteristic of the region is a type of fortress known as [[dzong architecture]]. 

[[دوتنه:Bhutan-masked-dance.jpg|thumb|200px|''Chaam'' or the masked dance is a mystic dance performed during Buddhist festivals.]]
Bhutan has numerous public holidays, most of which centre around traditional seasonal, secular and religious festivals. They include the [[winter solstice]] (around [[January 1]], depending on the lunar calendar), the lunar New Year (February or March), the King's birthday and the anniversary of his coronation, the official start of monsoon season ([[September 22]]), National Day ([[December 17]]), and various Buddhist and Hindu celebrations. Even the secular holidays have religious overtones, including religious dances and prayers for blessing the day. 

Masked dances and dance dramas are common traditional features at festivals, usually accompanied by traditional music. Energetic dancers, wearing colourful wooden or composition facemasks and stylised costumes, depict heroes, demons, death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people. The dancers enjoy royal patronage, and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient art of mask making. 

The ''[[Kuensel]],'' Bhutan's only legal [[newspaper]] (several [[samizdat]] periodicals may be found on the internet), circulates biweekly in Dzongkha, English and Nepali. Bhutan has about 15,000 [[Internet]] users ( subscribers?), 25,200 [[landline]] subscribers, and 40,000 [[mobile phone]] subscribers. The [[Bhutan Broadcasting Service]] was established in 1973 as a radio service, broadcasting in [[short wave]] nationally, and on the [[Frequency modulation|FM]] band in Thimphu. The service started television broadcasts in 1999, making Bhutan the last country in the world to introduce television. As part of the King's modernization program, [[cable television]] was introduced shortly after. By 2002, however, the crime rate had increased appreciably, and the introduction of cable television is alleged to be responsible for the spurt in crime.{{ref|guard}}

Bhutanese [[lama]] [[Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche]] is a well-known filmmaker, who produced and directed ''[[The Cup]]'' as well as ''[[Travellers and Magicians]]''. While ''The Cup'' was shot in a Tibetan [[Buddhist monastery|monastery]] in northern India, ''Travellers and Magicians'' was the first feature film to be filmed entirely in Bhutan, with a cast comprised entirely of Bhutanese people. No professional actors were used in either of the two films.

# {{note|population}} The population of Bhutan per the Government of Bhutan census is 734,320 (2003)[http://www.bhutan.gov.bt/govataglance.php].  The population estimate in the [[CIA Factbook]] is 2,232,291 although it notes that other estimates are as low as 810,000. [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bt.html].  The [[United Nations]] estimate is 2,163,000 (2005).  Neither the CIA nor the United Nations documents their methods of population estimate, while the government of Bhutan provides detailed population figures down to the [[gewog]] level.  The CIA numbers may include the approximately 100,000  Nepali immigrants who were exiled from Bhutan in the late 1980s and now reside in UN-administered refugee camps in Nepal. Country rankings are based on the CIA Factbook.
