The smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is sometimes called dayan (lit. "right"; a.k.a. dāhina, siddha, chattū) but is correctly called the "tabla." It is made from a conical piece of mostly teak and rosewood hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth. The drum is tuned to a specific note, usually either the tonic, dominant or sub-dominant of the soloist's key and thus complements the melody. The tuning range is limited although different dāyāñ-s are produced in different sizes, each with a different range. Cylindrical wood blocks, known as ghatta, are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning. Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small hammer.

The larger drum, played with the other hand, is called bāyāñ (lit. "left"; a.k.a. dagga, duggī, dhāmā). The bāyāñ has a much deeper bass tone, much like its distant cousin, the kettle drum. The bāyāñ may be made of any of a number of materials. Brass is the most common, copper is more expensive, but generally held to be the best, while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models. One sometimes finds that wood is used, especially in old bāyāñs from the Punjab. Clay is also used, although not favored for durability; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal.

Both drum shells are covered with a head (or puri) constructed from goat or cow skin. An outer ring of skin (keenar) is overlaid on the main skin and serves to suppress some of the natural overtones. These two skins are bound together with a complex woven braid that gives the assembly enough strength to be tensioned on the shell. The head is affixed to the drum shell with a single cow or camel hide strap laced between the braid of the head assembly and another ring (made from the same strap material) placed on the bottom of the drum.

The head of each drum has a central area called the Syahi (lit. "ink"; a.k.a. shāī or gāb). This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch (rice or wheat) mixed with a black powder of various origins. The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drum's natural overtones, resulting in the clarity of pitch and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument. The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument. For stability while playing, each drum is positioned on a toroidal bundle called chutta or guddi, consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth.

The term gharānā is used to specify a lineage of teaching and repertoire in Indian classical music. Most performers and scholars recognize two styles of tabla gharana: Dilli Baj and Purbi Baj. Dilli (or Delhi) baj comes from the style that developed in Delhi, and Purbi (meaning eastern) baj developed in the area east of Delhi. Delhi Baj is also known as Chati baj (Chati is a part of Tabla from where special tone can be produced).

Musicians then recognize six gharānās – schools or traditions – of tabla. These traditions appeared or evolved in presumably[citation needed] the following order:

   1. Delhi gharānā
   2. Lucknow gharānā
   3. Ajrara gharānā, later followed by
   4. Farukhabad gharānā
   5. Benares gharānā
   6. Punjab gharānā

Other tabla performers have identified further derivations of the above traditions, but these are subjective claims not universally recognized.[citation needed] Some traditions indeed have sub-lineages and sub-styles that meet the criteria to warrant a separate gharānā name, but such socio-musical identities have not taken hold in the public discourse of Hindustani art music, such as the Qasur lineage of tabla players of the Punjab region.

Each gharānā is traditionally set apart from the others by unique aspects of the compositional and playing styles of its exponents. For instance, some gharānās have different tabla positioning and bol techniques. In the days of court patronage the preservation of these distinctions was important in order to maintain the prestige of the sponsoring court. Gharānā secrets were closely guarded and often only passed along family lines. Being born into or marrying into a lineage holding family was often the only way to gain access to this knowledge.

Today many of these gharānā distinctions have been blurred as information has been more freely shared and newer generations of players have learned and combined aspects from multiple gharānās to form their own styles. There is much debate as to whether the concept of gharānā even still applies to modern players. Some think the era of gharānā has effectively come to an end as the unique aspects of each gharānā have been mostly lost through the mixing of styles and the socio-economic difficulties of maintaining lineage purity through rigorous training.

Nonetheless the greatness of each gharānā can still be observed through study of its traditional material and, when accessible, recordings of its great players. The current generation of traditionally trained masters still hold vast amounts of traditional compositional knowledge and expertise.

This body of compositional knowledge and the intricate theoretical basis which informs it is still actively being transmitted from teacher to student all over the world. In addition to the instrument itself, the term tabla is often used in reference to this knowledge and the process of its transmission.

Next to the contemporary common style of tabla, there exists older styles in which the bayan (called Dhama or Dhamma) is often made out of wood. Instead of having a thin dry syahi, this style of tabla uses a wet wheat dough on the bass drum's skin. The dough is applied shortly before playing. It produces a more vivid and shattering bass sound. These types of (Jori) tabla are used by Qawwali ensembles (notably Dildar Hussain), Sikh, Pakhawaj inspired Tabla Gharanas (Punjabi Dhrupad), Gurbani Kirtan and Afghan trad. folk music. A reminder, that this style of tabla was used all over India not long ago is that many modern tabla tuning (brass) hammers still have a dough (removal) spatula on the reverse end. These hammers are produced from older hammer molds. However, many modern (steel) hammers do not have this spatula. The swift sliding bass sound (Giss or Gissa), commonly associated with modern style tabla sets can also be produced on wet dough dhamma style bass drums. This is best demonstrated by Punjabi qawwali drummers.This same style of wet weighting masala is also used on the Pakhawajs bass side. The pakhawaj is considered the drum from which the tabla was derived.

Currently there are two traditional notation systems called as Pt. Bhatkhande and Pt. Paluskar Notation System. However, these notation systems are incomplete. Pt. Bhatkhande Notation system does not account for any Jati and Laya. Whereas Pt. Paluskar Notation system does not account for Khanda or Mishra Jati. It is also inadequate for laya in Tigun or Chougun (Three times or Four Times). Recently Sanjeev Shelar from Aurangabad,India has developed a new notation system, which is complete in all respect. It not only shows the Matra in various Jati and Laya, but it also shows how Nikas is done on tabla. The tabla notation system is available in three languages as English, Hindi and Marathi.
