امير محمد عالم خان (۱۸۸۰-۱۹۴۴ز) كې د مغولي واكمنۍ وروستې [[امير]] ؤ، چې په [[بخارا]] يې واكمني كوله.  كه څه هم [[بخارا]] د تزاري روسيې تر واك لاندې وه، خو دې [[امير]] وكړاى شول، چې له ۱۹۱۱ز د جنورۍ له درېيمې تر ۱۹۲۰ز ۳۰ اګست پورې خپل [[امارات]] پدې ښار كې نه يواځې وساتي، بلكه خپله [[خپلواكي]] هم ترلاسه كړي.  دا امير د [[جنګېز خان]] له نسل څخه ؤ. 



At the age of thirteen, Alim Khan was sent by his father Emir [['Abd al-Ahad Khan|Abdulahad Khan]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] for three years to study government and modern military techniques. In [[1896]], having received formal confirmation as [[Crown Prince]] of Bukhara by the Russian government, he returned home.

After two years in Bukhara assisting in his father's administration, he was appointed governor of Nasef region for the next twelve years. He was then transferred to the northern province of Karminah, which he ruled for another two years, until receiving word in [[1910]] of his father's death. 

Alim Khan's rule began with promise. Initially, he declared that he would no longer expect or accept any gifts, and prohibited his officials from demanding [[bribery|bribes]] from the public, or imposing [[tax]]es on their own authority.  However, as time went by the Emir's attitude towards bribes, taxes, and state salaries changed. The conflict between the traditionalists and the reformists ended with the traditionalists in control, and the reformers in exile in [[Moscow]] or [[Kazan]]. It is thought that Alim Khan, who initially favored [[modernization]] and the reformists, realised that their eventual goals included no place for either him or his descendants as rulers. Like his predecessors, Alim Khan was a traditional ruler. He toyed with the idea of reform as a tool to keep the clergy in line, and only as long as he saw the possibility of using it to strengthen Manghit rule.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

One of the most important [[tajiks|Tajik]] writers, [[Aini Sadriddin]], wrote vivid accounts of life under the Emir. He was whipped for speaking [[Tajik language|Tajik]] and later wrote about the life under the Emirs in the ''Bukhara Executioners'' ("Jallodon-i Bukhara").

Alim Khan was the first and only Manghit ruler to add the title of [[Caliph]] to his name, and was the last direct descendant of [[Genghis Khan]] to serve as a national ruler.

In March [[1918]] activists of the Young Bukharan Movement informed the Bolsheviks that the Bukharans were ready for the revolution and that the people were awaiting liberation. The Red Army marched to the gates of Bukhara and demanded that the emir surrender the city to the Young Bukharans. As Russian sources report, the emir responded by murdering the Bolshevik delegation, along with several hundred Russian inhabitants of Bukhara and the surrounding territories. The majority of Bukharans did not support an invasion and the ill-equipped and ill-disciplined Bolshevik army fled back to the Soviet stronghold at [[Tashkent]]. 

However, the emir had won only a temporary respite. As the civil war in Russia wound down, Moscow sent reinforcements to Central Asia. On [[2 September]] [[1920]], an army of well-disciplined and well equipped [[Red Army]] troops under the command of Bolshevik general [[Mikhail Frunze]] attacked the city. After four days of fighting, the emir’s citadel (Arc) was destroyed, the red flag was raised from the top of [[Po-i-Kalyan|Kalyan Minaret]], and the Emir [[Alim Khan]] was forced to flee to his base at [[Dushanbe]] in [[Eastern Bukharan]], and finally to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. 

He died in [[Kabul]] in [[1944]].
