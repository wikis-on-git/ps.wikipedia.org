'''Sikhism''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{Audio-IPA|Seekism.ogg|['siːkɪz(ə)m]}} or {{Audio-IPA-nohelp|Sikism.ogg|['sɪk-]}}; {{lang-pa|ਸਿੱਖੀ}}, ''{{IAST|sikkhī}}'', IPA: {{Audio-IPA-nohelp|Sikkhi.ogg|['sɪk.kʰiː]}}) is a [[religion]] that began in [[16th century|sixteenth century]] [[Northern India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]]. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally ''the teachings of the gurus'') or the Sikh Dharma. ''Sikhism'' comes from the word ''Sikh'', which in turn comes from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''{{IAST|[[śiṣya]]}}'' meaning "disciple" or "learner", or ''{{IAST|śikṣa}}'' meaning "instruction."<ref>{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | id = ISBN 0-19-567747-1 | pages=15}}</ref><ref>{{pa icon}} {{cite book | last=Nabha | first=Kahan Singh | year=1930 | language=Punjabi | title=Gur Shabad Ratnakar Mahan Kosh/{{lang|pa|ਗੁਰ ਸ਼ਬਦ ਰਤਨਾਕਰ ਮਹਾਨ ਕੋਸ਼}}| url=http://www.ik13.com/online_library.htm#mahankosh | accessdate=2006-05-29 | pages=720}}</ref> Sikhism is the [[Major religious groups|fifth-largest]] organised religion in the world.

The principal belief in Sikhism is faith in ''[[Waheguru|Vāhigurū]]''—represented using the sacred symbol of ''{{unicode|[[Ek Onkar|ēk ōaṅkār]]}}''. Sikhism advocates the pursuit of salvation through disciplined, personal meditation on the name and message of God. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[The Sikh Gurus|Sikh gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture—the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sāhib]]''—which includes the selected works of many authors from diverse socioeconomic and religious backgrounds. The text was decreed by [[Guru Gobind Singh|Gobind Singh]], the tenth guru, as the final guru of the [[Khalsa Panth]]. Sikhism's traditions and teachings are distinctly associated with the history, society and culture of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. 

Adherents of Sikhism are known as [[Sikh]]s (''students'' or ''disciples'') and number over 23 million across the world. However, most Sikhs live in the [[Punjab (India)|state of Punjab]] in [[India]]; prior to [[Partition of India|partition]], millions of Sikhs lived in what is now the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab province]] of [[Pakistan]].

The Mughal Empire arrived in South Asia around 711 and started with the Qureshi's and many tribes where Muhammad was from. The main goal was for Hindustan to become pure Muslim however Sikhism interupted that movement and then the British

Sikhism was made during the Mughal Empire and defended the people. Sikhism was basically made to destroy the Mughal Empire where many Muslims fought with Sikhs. Their founder of Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh who developed the Khalsa Panth made it so the Muslims will understand that Sikhs are defending

Sikh religious philosophy has roots in the religious traditions of northern India.<ref name="parrinderp259">{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=259}}</ref> The ''[[Sant Mat]]'' traditions are fundamental to the teachings of Sikhism's founder, Nanak. Especially important to the connection with Sikhism were the teachings of some of the saints such as Ravidas and [[Kabir]]. Sikhism is also inspired by the emphasis on devotion to God in the traditions of [[Vaishnavism]], especially through the ''[[Bhakti]]'' movement, as well as influences of [[Sufism]]. However, Nanak's teachings diverge significantly from Vaishnavism in their rejection of idol worship, the doctrine of [[Avatara|divine incarnations]] and a strict emphasis on inward devotion; Sikhism is professed to be a more difficult personal pursuit than ''[[Bhakti]]''.<ref name="p252">{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=252}}</ref> The evolution of Nanak's thoughts on the basis of his own experiences and study have also given Sikhism a distinctly unique feature.



Scholars have presented Sikhism as both a distinct faith and a [[syncretic]] religion which combines some elements of [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]].  Sikhs maintain that their religion was directly revealed by God, and many of them consider the notion that Sikhism is a syncretic religion to be offensive.

=== God ===
In Sikhism, God – termed ''[[Waheguru|Vāhigurū]]'' – is [[Nirankar|formless]], [[akal|eternal]], and 
[[Alakh Niranjan|unobserved]]: ''{{unicode|niraṅkār}}'', ''akāl'', and ''alakh''. Nanak interpreted Vāhigurū as a single, personal and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] creator. The beginning of the first composition of Sikh scripture is the figure "[[1 (number)|1]]"—signifying the unity of God. To achieve salvation, the devotee must develop an intimate faith in and relationship with God.<ref name="p252"/> God is [[omnipresent]] and infinite, and is signified by the term ''[[Ek Onkar|ēk ōaṅkār]]''. Sikhs believe that prior to creation, all that existed was God and his infinite ''[[hukam]]'' (will).<ref>{{cite book | last = Dev | first = Nanak | authorlink = Guru Nanak | title = Gurū Granth Sāhib | url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1035&punjabi=t#l44288 | accessdate=2006-06-15 | pages=1035 | quote=For endless eons, there was only utter darkness. There was no earth or sky; there was only the infinite Command of His Hukam. }}</ref> When God willed, the entire cosmos was created. From these beginnings, God nurtured "enticement and attachment" to ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', or the human perception of reality.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dev | first = Nanak | authorlink = Guru Nanak | title = Gurū Granth Sāhib | url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1036&punjabi=t#l44327 | accessdate=2006-06-15 | pages=1036 | quote=When He so willed, He created the world. Without any supporting power, He sustained the universe. He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; He fostered enticement and attachment to Maya. ||14||}}</ref>  

While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,<ref name="p252"/> Nanak described God as not wholly unknowable. God is omnipresent (''[[sarav viāpak]]'') in all creation and visible everywhere to the spiritually awakened. Nanak stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye," or the "heart" of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment. Nanak emphasised the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.<ref name="p252"/> God has no gender in Sikhism, though translations may incorrectly present a masculine God. In addition, Nanak wrote that there are many worlds on which God has created life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dev | first = Nanak | authorlink = Guru Nanak | title = Gurū Granth Sāhib | url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=15&punjabi=t&id=632#l632 | accessdate=2006-06-15 | pages=15 | quote=You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other beings, of so many worlds. ||3|| }}</ref>

=== Pursuing salvation ===

Nanak's teachings are founded not on a final destination of [[heaven]] or [[hell]], but on a spiritual union with God which results in [[salvation]]. The chief obstacles to the attainment of salvation are social conflicts and an attachment to worldly pursuits, which commit men and women to an endless cycle of birth - a concept known as ''[[karma]]''. 

''[[Maya (illusion)|Māyā]]''—defined as illusion or "unreality"—is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation - people are distracted from devotion by worldly attractions which give only illusive satisfaction. However, Nanak emphasised māyā as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhism, the influences of [[ahankar|ego]], [[krodh|anger]], [[lobh|greed]], [[moh|attachment]] and [[kam|lust]]—known as the ''Five Evils''—are to be particularly pernicious. The fate of people vulnerable to the Five Evils is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.<ref>{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=253}}</ref>  

Nanak described God's revelation—the path to salvation—with terms such as ''nām'' (the divine ''Name'') and ''[[shabad|śabad]]'' (the divine Word) to emphasise the totality of the revelation. Nanak designated the word ''guru'' (meaning ''teacher'') as the voice of God and the source and guide for knowledge and salvation.<ref name="p254">{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=254}}</ref> Salvation can be reached only through rigorous and disciplined devotion to God. Nanak distinctly emphasised the irrelevance of outwardly observations such as rites, pilgrimages or [[asceticism]]. He stressed that devotion must take place through the heart, with the spirit and the soul. 

A key practice to be pursued is ''{{unicode|[[Nām Japō|nām simraṇ]]}}''—remembrance of the divine Name. The verbal repetition of the name of God or a sacred syllable is an established practice in religious traditions in India, but Nanak's interpretation emphasised inward, personal observance. Nanak's ideal is the total exposure of one's being to the divine Name and a total conforming to the divine Order. Nanak described the result of the disciplined application of ''{{unicode|nām simraṇ}}'' as a "growing towards and into God" through a gradual process of five stages. The last of these is ''{{unicode|[[Sach Khand|sac khaṇḍ]]}}'' (''The Realm of Truth'')—the final union of the spirit with God.<ref name="p254"/> 

Nanak stressed ''[[kirat karō]]'' - that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''{{unicode|[[caṛdī kalā]]}}'', or ''optimistic'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—''{{unicode|[[vaṇḍ chakkō]]}}''—through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''{{unicode|[[langar|laṅgar]]}}''), giving charitable donations, and working for the betterment of the community and others (''sēvā'').

== The ten gurus and religious authority ==
{{main|Sikh Gurus}}
[[دوتنه:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A rare [[Tanjore painting|Tanjore]] style painting from the late 19th century depicting the ten Sikh Gurus with [[Bhai Bala]] and [[Bhai Mardana]].]]
The term [[guru]] comes from the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurū'', meaning teacher, guide or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were established by ten specific gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, resulting in the creation of the Sikh religion. [[Guru Nanak Dev]] was the first guru and appointed a disciple as successor. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] was the final guru in human form. Before his death, Gobind Singh decreed that the [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] would be the final and perpetual guru of the Sikhs.<ref name="granthfinalguru">{{cite book | last=Mann | first=Gurinder Singh | year=2001 | title=The Making of Sikh Scripture | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-19-513024-3 | pages=21}}</ref>
{{List_of_Sikh_Gurus}}

After Nanak's death, the most important phase in the development of Sikhism came with the third successor, Amar Das. Nanak's teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Nanak had significant but loose followings. Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage and death. Amar Das also established the ''manji'' (comparable to a [[diocese]]) system of clerical supervision. <ref name="p254"/> 
[[دوتنه:Interior of Akal Takht.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The interior of the Akal Takht.]]
Amar Das's successor and son-in-law Ram Das founded the city of [[Amritsar]], which is home of the [[Harimandir Sahib]] and regarded widely as the holiest city for all Sikhs. When Ram Das's youngest son Arjun Dev succeeded him, the line of male gurus from the ''Sodhi Khatri'' family was established: all succeeding gurus were direct descendants of this line. Arjun Dev was responsible for compiling the Sikh scriptures. Arjun Dev was captured by Mughal authorities who were suspicious and hostile to the religious order he was developing.<ref>{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=255}}</ref> His persecution and death inspired his successors to promote a military and political organisation of Sikh communities to defend themselves against the attacks of Mughal forces.

The Sikh gurus established a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react as a community to changing circumstances.  The sixth guru, Har Gobind, was responsible for the creation of the [[Akal Takht]] (''throne of the timeless one'') which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhdom and sits opposite the Harimandir Sahib. The ''{{unicode|[[Sarbat Khalsa|Sarbat Ḵẖālsā]]}}'' (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Diwali and when there is a need to discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A ''[[gurmata|gurmatā]]'' (literally, ''guru's intention'') is an order passed by the {{unicode|Sarbat Ḵẖālsā}} in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sgpc.net/sikhism/tankah.asp | title=Sikh Reht Maryada - Method of Adopting Gurmatta | accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> The term ''[[Hukamnama|hukamnāmā]]'' (literally, ''edict'' or ''royal order'') is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā.  However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is given as an order to Sikhs.

== History ==
{{main|History of Sikhism}}
[[دوتنه:Guru.Nanak.with.Hindu.holymen.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Guru Nanak Dev]], the founder of Sikhism, with Hindu holy men.]]
[[Guru Nanak Dev]] (1469–1538), the founder of Sikhism, was born in the village of ''Rāi Bhōi dī Talvaṇḍī'', now called [[Nankana Sahib]], near [[Lahore]] (in what is present-day [[Pakistan]]).<ref>{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | id = ISBN 0-19-567747-1 | pages=12-13}} Also, as according to the Purātan Janamsākhī (the birth stories of Nanak).</ref> His father, [[Mehta Kalu]] was a [[Patwari]]—an [[accountant]] of land revenue in the government.  Nanak's mother was [[Mata Tripta|Tripta Devi]] and he had one older sister, [[Bibi Nanki|Nanaki]]. His parents were [[Khatri]] [[Hindu]]s of the [[Bedi]] clan. As a boy, Nanak was fascinated by religion, and his desire to explore the mysteries of life eventually led him to leave home. It was during this period that Nanak was said to have met [[Kabir]] (1440–1518), a saint revered by people of different faiths. 

Sikh tradition states that at the age of thirty, Nanak went missing and was presumed to have drowned after going for one of his morning baths to a local stream called the ''Kali Bein''.  Three days later he reappeared and would give the same answer to any question posed to him: "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim" (in Punjabi, "''nā kō hindū nā kō musalmān''").  It was from this moment that Nanak would begin to spread the teachings of what was then the beginning of Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher | coauthors= Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xiii-xiv}}</ref> Although the exact account of his itinerary is disputed, he is widely acknowledged to have made four major journeys, spanning thousands of kilometres. The first tour being east towards [[Bengal]] and [[Assam]], the second south towards [[Ceylon]] via [[Tamil Nadu]], the third north towards [[Kashmir]], [[Ladakh]] and [[Tibet]], and the final tour west towards [[Baghdad]] and [[Mecca]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | id = ISBN 0-19-567747-1 | pages=14}}</ref> 

Nanak was married to Sulakhni, the daughter of Moolchand Chona, a rice [[trader]] from the town of [[Batala]]. They had two sons. The elder son, [[Sri Chand]] was an ascetic and he came to have a considerable following of his own, known as the [[Udasi]]s.  The younger son, Lakshmi Das, on the other hand was totally immersed in worldly life. To Nanak, who believed in the ideal of ''{{unicode|rāj maiṁ jōg}}'' (detachment in civic life), both his sons were unfit to carry on the Guruship.

=== Growth of the Sikh community ===
[[دوتنه:Guru Arjun Dev being pronounced fifth guru.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Baba Buddha places a tikka (a mark of distinction) on the forehead of Guru Arjun Dev, pronouncing him the fifth Guru. Guru Ram Das is seated on the right.]]
In 1538, Nanak chose his disciple ''{{unicode|Lahiṇā}}'', a [[Khatri]] of the [[Trehan]] clan, as a successor to the guruship rather than either of his sons. {{unicode|Lahiṇā}} was named [[Guru Angad Dev]] and became the second guru of the Sikhs.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher | coauthors= Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xv}}</ref> Nanak conferred his choice at the town of [[Kartarpur]] on the banks of the river [[Ravi River|Ravi]], where Nanak had finally settled down after his travels. Though Sri Chand was not an ambitious man, the Udasis believed that the Guruship should have gone to him, since he was a man of pious habits in addition to being Nanak's son. They refused to accept Angad's succession. On Nanak's advice, Angad shifted from Kartarpur to Khadur, where his wife [[Mata Khivi|Khivi]] and children were living, until he was able to bridge the divide between his followers and the Udasis. Angad continued the work started by Nanak and is widely credited for standardising the [[Gurmukhī script]] as used in the sacred scripture of the Sikhs.

[[Guru Amar Das]], a [[Khatri]] of the [[Bhalla]] clan, became the third Sikh guru in 1552 at the age of 73. [[Goindval]] became an important centre for Sikhism during the guruship of Amar Das.  He preached the principle of equality for women by prohibiting [[purdah]] and [[sati (practice)|sati]].  Amar Das also encouraged the practice of {{unicode|[[langar|laṅgar]]}} and made all those who visited him attend laṅgar before they could speak to him.<ref>{{cite book | last=Duggal | first=Kartar Singh | year=1988 | title=Philosophy and Faith of Sikhism | publisher=Himalayan Institute Press | id = ISBN 0-89389-109-6 | pages=15}}</ref>  In 1567, [[Emperor Akbar]] sat with the ordinary and poor people of Punjab to have {{unicode|laṅgar}}.  Amar Das also trained 146 apostles of which 52 were women, to manage the rapid expansion of the religion.<ref>{{cite web | last=Brar | first=Sandeep Singh | year=1998 | title=The Sikhism Homepage:  Guru Amar Das | url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru3.htm | accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> Before he died in 1574 aged 95, he appointed his son-in-law {{unicode|Jēṭhā}}, a Khatri of the [[Sodhi]] clan, as the fourth Sikh guru.
[[دوتنه:Hargobind_Singh.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mid-nineteenth century miniature of Guru Har Gobind.]]
''{{unicode|Jēṭhā}}'' became [[Guru Ram Das]] and vigorously undertook his duties as the new guru. He is responsible for the establishment of the city of Ramdaspur later to be named [[Amritsar]]. In 1581, [[Guru Arjun Dev]]—youngest son of the fourth guru—became the fifth guru of the Sikhs. In addition to being responsible for building the [[Harimandir Sahib]] (often called the Golden Temple), he prepared the Sikh sacred text known as the [[Adi Granth|Ādi Granth]] (literally ''the first book'') and included the writings of the first five gurus. In 1606, for refusing to make changes to the Granth and for supporting an unsuccessful contender to the throne, he was tortured and killed by the [[Mughal]] ruler, [[Jahangir]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher | coauthors= Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge | location=United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xv-xvi}}</ref>

=== Political advancement ===

[[Guru Har Gobind]], became the sixth guru of the Sikhs. He carried two swords—one for [[spirituality|spiritual]] and the other for [[secularism|temporal]] reasons (known as ''mīrī'' and ''pīrī'' in Sikhism).<ref>{{cite book | last=Mahmood | first=Cynthia | year=2002 | title=A Sea of Orange | publisher=Xlibris | location=United States | id = ISBN 1-4010-2856-X | pages=16}}</ref>  Sikhs grew as an organised community and always had a trained fighting force to defend their independence. In 1644, [[Guru Har Rai]] became guru followed by [[Guru Har Krishan]], the boy guru, in 1661.  No hymns composed by these three gurus are included in the Sikh holy book.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher | coauthors= Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xvi}}</ref>

[[Guru Teg Bahadur]] became guru in 1665 and led the Sikhs until 1675.  Teg Bahadur was [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar|executed]] by [[Aurangzeb]] for helping to protect Hindus, after a delegation of [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s came to him for help when the Emperor condemned them to death for failing to convert to Islam.<ref>{{cite book | last=Rama | first=Swami | year=1986 | title=Celestial Song/Gobind Geet: The Dramatic Dialogue Between Guru Gobind Singh and Banda Singh Bahadur | publisher=Himalayan Institute Press | id = ISBN 0-89389-103-7 | pages=7-8}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son, Gobind Rai who was just nine years old at the time of his father's death.  Gobind Rai further militarised his followers, and was baptised by the ''{{unicode|[[Panj Piare|Pañj Piārē]]}}'' when he formed the [[Khalsa]] in 1699.  From here on in he was known as [[Guru Gobind Singh]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | id = ISBN 0-19-567747-1 | pages=37-38}}</ref> 

From the time of Nanak, when it was a loose collection of followers who focused entirely on the attainment of salvation and God, the Sikh community had significantly transformed. Even though the core Sikh religious philosophy was never affected, the followers now began to develop a political identity. Conflict with Mughal authorities escalated during the lifetime of Teg Bahadur and Gobind Singh. The latter founded the Khalsa in 1699. The Khalsa is a disciplined community that combines its religious purpose and goals with political and military duties.<ref name="parrinderp259"/> After Aurangzeb killed four of his sons, Gobind Singh sent Aurangzeb the [[Zafarnama|Zafarnāmā]] (''Notification/Epistle of Victory'').

Shortly before his death, Gobind Singh ordered that the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sāhib]] (the Sikh Holy Scripture), would be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs and temporal authority would be vested in the Khalsa Panth – The Sikh Nation/Community.<ref name="granthfinalguru"/> The first scripture was compiled and edited by the fifth guru, Arjun Dev, in 1604. 
[[دوتنه:Guru Gobind Singh meets Guru Nanak Dev.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Guru Gobind Singh (with bird) encounters Guru Nanak Dev. An 18th century painting of an imaginary meeting.]]
[[Banda Bahadur]], a former ascetic, was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of punishing those who had persecuted the Sikhs.  After the guru's death, Banda Bahadur became the leader of the Sikh army and was responsible for several attacks on the Mughal empire.  He was executed by the emperor [[Jahandar Shah]] after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam.<ref>{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | id = ISBN 0-19-567747-1 | pages=47-53}}</ref>

The Sikh community's embrace of military and political organisation made it a considerable regional force in medieval India and it continued to evolve after the demise of the gurus.  After the death of Banda Bahadur, a [[Sikh Confederacy|loose confederation]] of Sikh warrior bands known as ''[[misls]]'' formed.  With the decline of the Mughal empire, a Sikh empire arose in the Punjab under [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], with its capital in [[Lahore]] and limits reaching the [[Khyber Pass]] and the borders of [[China]]. The order, traditions and discipline developed over centuries culminated at the time of Ranjit Singh to give rise to the common religious and social identity that the term "Sikhism" describes.<ref name="parrinderp256">{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=256}}</ref>

After the death of Ranjit Singh, the Sikh kingdom fell into disorder and eventually collapsed with the [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]], which brought the Punjab under [[British Raj|British rule]]. Sikhs supported and participated in the [[Indian National Congress]], but also formed the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] and the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] to preserve Sikhs religious and political organisation. With the [[partition of India]] in 1947, thousands of Sikhs were killed in violence and millions were forced to leave their ancestral homes in [[West Punjab]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Pandey | first=Gyanendra | year=2001 | title=Remembering Partition: Violence, Nationalism and History in India | publisher=Cambridge University Press | id = ISBN 0-521-00250-8 | pages=33}}</ref> Even though Sikhs enjoyed considerable prosperity in the 1970s with the [[Green Revolution]] making Punjab the most prosperous state in the nation, a fringe group led by cleric [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] began demanding an independent state named [[Khalistan]], led to clashes between militant groups and government forces, as well as [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots|communal violence]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Horowitz | first=Donald L. | year=2003 | title=The Deadly Ethnic Riot | publisher=University of California Press | id = ISBN 0-520-23642-4 | pages=482-485}}</ref>

<!--[[Image:Dictation of the Guru Granth Saheb.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Guru Arjun Dev|Guru Arjun Dev]] dictating the Ādi Granth to [[Bhai Gurdas]]. ]] Removed temporarily due to copyright issues -->

There are two primary sources of scripture for the Sikhs: the Gurū Granth Sāhib and the Dasam Granth.  The Gurū Granth Sāhib may be referred to as the Ādi Granth—literally, ''The First Volume''—and the two terms are often used synonymously. Here, however, the Ādi Granth refers to the version of the scripture created by [[Guru Arjun Dev|Arjun Dev]] in 1604. The Gurū Granth Sāhib refers to the final version of the scripture created by [[Guru Gobind Singh|Gobind Singh]].

It is believed that the Ādi Granth was compiled primarily by [[Bhai Gurdas]] under the supervision of [[Guru Arjun Dev|Arjun Dev]] between the years 1603 and 1604.<ref>{{cite book | last=Trumpp | first=Ernest | year=2004 | origyear=1877 | title=The Ādi Granth or the Holy Scriptures of the Sikhs | publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers | location=India | id = ISBN 81-215-0244-6 | pages=1xxxi}}</ref>  It is written in the [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhī]] script, which is a descendant of the {{unicode|[[Laṇḍā]]}} script used in the Punjab at that time.<ref>{{cite book | last=Grierson | first=George Abraham | authorlink=George Abraham Grierson | year=1967 | origyear=1927 | title=The Linguistic Survey of India | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | location=India | id = ISBN 81-85395-27-6 | pages=624}}</ref> The [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhī]] script was standardised by Arjun Dev for use in the Sikh scriptures and is thought to have been influenced by the {{unicode|[[Śāradā]]}} and [[Devanāgarī]] scripts. An authoritative scripture was created to protect the integrity of hymns and teachings of the Sikh gurus and selected bhagats. At the time, Arjun Dev tried to prevent undue influence from the followers of Prithi Chand, the guru's older brother and rival.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mann | first=Gurinder Singh | year=2001 | title=The Making of Sikh Scripture | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-19-513024-3 | pages=19}}</ref>

The original version of the Ādi Granth is known as the ''{{unicode|kartārpur bīṛ}}'' and is currently held by the Sodhi family of Kartarpur.

=== Guru Granth Sahib ===
[[دوتنه:Sri_Guru_Granth_Sahib_Nishan.jpg|250px|thumb|Gurū Granth Sāhib folio with Mūl Mantra.|right]] 
{{main|Gurū Granth Sāhib}}

The final version of the Gurū Granth Sāhib was compiled by Guru Gobind Singh.  It consists of the original Ādi Granth with the addition of Guru Teg Bahadur's hymns.  It was decreed by Gobind Singh that the Granth was to be considered the eternal, living guru of all Sikhs:

:[[Punjabi]]: {{lang|pa|ਸੱਬ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਕੋ ਹੁਕਮ ਹੈ ਗੁਰੂ ਮਾਨਯੋ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ ।}}
:[[Transliteration]]: {{unicode|Sabb sikkhaṇ kō hukam hai gurū mānyō granth.}}
:[[English language|English]]: All Sikhs are commanded to take the Granth as Guru.

It contains compositions by the first five gurus, Guru Teg Bahadur and just one ''{{unicode|[[Shloka|śalōk]]}}'' (''couplet'') from Guru Gobind Singh.<ref>{{cite web | last=Brar | first=Sandeep Singh | year=1998 | title=The Sikhism Homepage:  Sri Guru Granth Sahib - Authors & Contributors | url=http://www.sikhs.org/granth2.htm | accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>  It also contains the traditions and teachings of ''sants'' (''saints'') such as [[Kabir]], [[Namdev]], [[Ravidas]] and [[Sheikh Farid]] along with several others.<ref name="parrinderp256"/>

The bulk of the scripture is classified into ''[[raga|rāgs]]'', with each rāg subdivided according to length and author. There are 31 main rāgs within the Gurū Granth Sāhib. In addition to the rāgs, there are clear references to the folk music of Punjab. The main language used in the scripture is known as ''{{unicode|[[Sant Bhasha|Sant Bhāṣā]]}}'', a language related to both Punjabi and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and used extensively across medieval northern India by proponents of popular devotional religion.<ref name="parrinderp259"/> The text further comprises over 5000 ''[[shabhad|śabads]]'', or hymns, which are poetically constructed and set to classical form of music rendition, can be set to predetermined musical ''[[Tala (music)|tāl]]'', or rhythmic beats.

The Granth begins with the ''[[Mul Mantra|Mūl Mantra]]'', an iconic verse created by Nanak:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[ISO 15919]] [[transliteration]]: ''{{unicode|Ika ōaṅkāra sati nāmu karatā purakhu nirabha'u niravairu akāla mūrati ajūnī saibhaṅ gura prasādi.}}''
:Simplified transliteration: {{unicode|Ik ōaṅkār sat nām kartā purkh nirbha'u nirvair akāl mūrat ajūnī saibhaṅ gur prasād.}}
:[[English language|English]]: There is One God, He is the supreme truth, He, the Creator, is without fear and without hate. He, the omnipresent, pervades the universe. He is not born, nor does he die again to be reborn. By His grace shalt thou worship Him.

All text within the Granth is known as ''[[gurbani|gurbānī]]''. Gurbānī, according to Nanak, was revealed by God directly, and the authors wrote it down for the followers. The status accorded to the scripture is defined by the evolving interpretation of the concept of ''gurū''. In the ''Sant'' tradition of Nanak, the guru was literally the word of God. The Sikh community soon transferred the role to a line of men who gave authoritative and practical expression to religious teachings and traditions, in addition to taking socio-political leadership of Sikh adherents. Gobind Singh declared an end of the line of human gurus, and now the Gurū Granth Sāhib serves as the eternal guru, with its interpretation vested with the community.<ref name="parrinderp259"/>

=== Dasam Granth ===
[[دوتنه:Dasam.Granth.Frontispiece.BL.Manuscript.1825-1850.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A [[frontispiece]] to the [[Dasam Granth]].]]
{{main|Dasam Granth}}
The Dasam Granth (formally ''dasvēṁ pātśāh kī granth'' or ''The Book of the Tenth Master'') is an eighteenth-century collection of miscellaneous works generally attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]].  The teachings of Gobind Singh were not included in Gurū Granth Sāhib, the holy book of the [[Sikh]]s, and instead were collected in the Dasam Granth.  Unlike the Gurū Granth Sāhib, the Dasam Granth was never declared to hold guruship.  The authenticity of some portions of the Granth has been questioned and the appropriateness of the Granth's content still causes much debate.

The entire Granth is written in the [[Gurmukhī script|Gurmukhī]] script, although most of the language is actually [[Brij Bhasha|Braj]] and not [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. Sikh tradition states that [[Bhai Mani Singh|Mani Singh]] collected the writings of Gobind Singh after his death to create the Granth.<ref>{{cite book | last=McLeod | first=WH | year=1993 | title=Studying the Sikhs: Issues for North America | chapter=The Study of Sikh Literature | publisher=SUNY Press | id = ISBN 0-7914-1425-6 | pages=60-61}}</ref>

From 1892 to 1897, scholars assembled at the [[Akal Takht]], [[Amritsar]], to study the various printed Dasam Granths and prepare the authoritative version. They concluded that the Dasam Granth was entirely the work of Gobind Singh. Further re-examinations and reviews took place in 1931, under the Darbar Sahib Committee of the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] they too vindicated the earlier conclusion..<ref>{{cite web | last=Singh | first=Kirpal | year=2002 | title= Sri Dasam Granth Sahib - About the Dasam Granth | url=http://www.dasamgranth.org/dasamgranth/about.shtml | accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>

=== Janamsakhis ===
{{main|Janamsākhīs}}

The Janamsākhīs (literally ''birth stories''), are writings which profess to be biographies of Guru Nanak Dev. Although not scripture in the strictest sense, they provide an interesting look at Nanak's life and the early start of Sikhism.  There are several—often contradictory and sometimes unreliable—Janamsākhīs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.

== Observances and ceremonies ==
[[دوتنه:GuruGranthSahib-HarimandirSahib.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A man reading the Gurū Granth Sāhib at the [[Harimandir Sahib]].]]
Observant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation from memory of specific passages from the Gurū Granth Sāhib, especially the ''Japu'' (or ''Japjī'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurdwara]] (also ''gurduārā'', meaning ''the doorway to God''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside.  Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste or race.

Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the temple, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads, and make an offering. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ardās]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ardās recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name="p260">{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | id = ISBN 0-87196-129-6 | pages=260}}</ref> 

The most sacred shrine is the  [[Harimandir Sahib]] in Amritsar, famously known as the ''Golden Temple''. Groups of Sikhs regularly visit and congregate at the Harimandir Sahib. On specific occasions, groups of Sikhs are permitted to undertake a pilgrimage to Sikh shrines in the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in Pakistan, especially at [[Nankana Sahib]] and the ''[[samādhī]]'' (place of cremation) of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Lahore.

Festivals in Sikhism mostly centre around the lives of the Gurus and Sikh martyrs. The [[SGPC]], the Sikh organisation in charge of upkeep of the gurdwaras, organises celebrations based on the new [[Nanakshahi]] calendar. This calendar is highly controversial among Sikhs and is not universally accepted. Several festivals (Hola Mohalla, Diwali and Guru Nanak's birthday) continue to be celebrated using the [[Hindu calendar]]. Sikh festivals include the following:

* [[Gurpurab]]s are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom.
* [[Vaisakhi]] normally occurs on 13 April and marks the beginning of the new spring year and the end of the harvest.  Sikhs celebrate it because on Vaisakhi in 1699, the tenth guru, Gobind Singh, began the [[Khalsa]] baptismal tradition.
* [[Diwali]] (also known as ''bandī chōḍ divas'') celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from the Gwalior Jail on [[26 October]] [[1619]].
* [[Hola Mohalla]] occurs the day after [[Holi]] and is when the [[Khalsa Panth]] gather at Anandpur and display their fighting skills.

=== Ceremonies and customs ===
[[دوتنه:Sikh wedding.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''anand kāraj'' (Sikh marriage) ceremony.]]
Nanak taught that rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship is of little use and Sikhs are discouraged from fasting or going on pilgrimages.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dev | first = Nanak | authorlink = Guru Nanak | title = Gurū Granth Sāhib | url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=75&english=t&id=3063#l3063 | accessdate=2006-06-30 | pages=75 | quote=Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and self-discipline are of no use, nor are rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship.}}</ref>  However, during the period of the later gurus, and due to increased institutionalisation of the religion, some ceremonies and rites did arise.  Sikhism is not a  proselytising religion and most Sikhs do not make active attempts to gain converts.  However, converts to Sikhism are welcomed, although there is no formal conversion ceremony.

Upon a child's birth, the Gurū Granth Sāhib is opened at a random point and the child is named using the first letter on the top left-hand corner of the left page. All boys are given the middle name or surname [[Singh]], and all girls are given the middle name  or surname [[Kaur]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Loehlin | first=Clinton Herbert | year=1964 | origyear=1958 | edition=Second edition | title=The Sikhs and Their Scriptures | publisher=Lucknow Publishing House | pages=42}}</ref> Sikhs are joined in wedlock through the ''[[Anand Karaj|anand kāraj]]'' ceremony.  Sikhs marry when they are sufficient age (child marriage is taboo), and without regard for the future spouse's caste or descent. The marriage ceremony is performed in the company of the Gurū Granth Sāhib; around which the couple circles four times.  After the ceremony is complete, the husband and wife are considered "a single soul in two bodies."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sgpc.net/sikhism/anand-sanskar.html | title=Sikh Reht Maryada - Anand Sanskar : (Sikh Matrimonial Ceremony and Conventions) | accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref>

According to Sikh religious rites, neither husband nor wife are permitted to divorce.  A Sikh couple that wishes to divorce may be able to do so in a civil court – but this is not condoned.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mansukhani | first=Gobind Singh | year=1977 | title=Introduction to Sikhism | url=http://allaboutsikhs.com/mansukh/123.htm | publisher=Hemkunt Press | location=India |accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref> Upon death, the body of a Sikh is usually cremated.  If this is not possible, any means of disposing the body may be employed.  The ''kīrtan sōhilā'' and ''ardās'' prayers are performed during the funeral ceremony (known as ''[[Antam Sanskar|antim sanskār]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sgpc.net/sikhism/antam-sanskar.asp | title=Sikh Reht Maryada - Funeral Ceremonies (Antam Sanskar) | accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref>

=== Baptism and the Khalsa ===
[[Khalsa]] (meaning ''pure'') is the name given by Gobind Singh to all Sikhs who have been baptised or initiated by taking ''[[ammrit]]'' in a ceremony called ''[[ammrit sañcār]]''. The first time that this ceremony took place was on [[Vaisakhi]], which fell on [[30 March]] [[1699]] at [[Anandpur Sahib]] in India.  It was on that occasion that Gobind Singh baptised the [[Panj Piare|Pañj Piārē]] who in turn baptised Gobind Singh himself.
[[دوتنه:Kakaars x3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A ''{{unicode|kaṛā}}'', ''{{unicode|kaṅghā}}'' and ''kirpān''.]]

Baptised [[Sikhs]] are bound to wear the [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as ''pañj kakkē'' or ''pañj kakār''), or articles of faith, at all times. The tenth guru, Gobind Singh, ordered these Five Ks to be worn so that a Sikh could actively use them to make a difference to their own and to others' spirituality. The 5 items are: ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|{{unicode|kaṅghā}}]]'' (small comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|{{unicode|kaṛā}}]]'' (circular heavy metal bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (ceremonial short sword), and ''[[kaccha|kacchā]]'' (special undergarment).  The Five Ks have both practical and symbolic purposes.<ref>{{cite book | last=Simmonds | first=David | year=1992 | title=Believers All: A Book of Six World Religions | publisher=Nelson Thornes | id = ISBN 0-17-437057-1 | pages=120-121}}</ref>

== Sikh people ==
{{main|Sikh}}

Worldwide, Sikhs number more than 23 million, but more than 90 percent of Sikhs live in the Indian state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], where they form close to 65 percent of the population.  Large communities of Sikhs live in the neighbouring states and indeed large communities of Sikhs can be found across India. However, Sikhs comprise only about 2 percent of the Indian population. Migration beginning from the nineteenth century led to the creation of significant communities in [[Canada]] (Brampton, Ontario; Surrey, British Columbia), the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Middle East]], [[East Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and more recently, the [[United States]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

Smaller populations of Sikhs are found in [[Mauritius]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Fiji]] and other countries.

As with most world religions, there are groups of Sikhs (such as the [[Namdhari]]s, [[Ravidasi]]s and [[Udasi]]s) who do not adhere to the mainstream principles followed by most Sikhs.  Some of these groups may not consider themselves a part of Sikhism, although similarities in beliefs and principles firmly render them a part of the Sikh religious domain. Groups such as the [[Nirankari]]s have a history of bad relations with mainstream Sikhism, and are considered pariahs by some Sikhs. Others, such as the [[Nihang]]s, tend to have little difference in belief and practice, and are considered Sikhs proper by mainstream Sikhism.
