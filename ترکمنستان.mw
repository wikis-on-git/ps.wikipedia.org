'''ترکمنستان''' چې په رسمي چارو کې د ترکمنستان د جمهوريت په نامه يادېږي، د منځنۍ آسيا يو هېواد دی. دا هېواد د [[افغانستان]]، [[ايران]]، [[قزاقستان]]، [[ازبکستان]] او د کاسپين سمندرګي سره ګډې پولې لري. د ۱۹۹۱ زېږيز کال نه دمخه دا هېواد د پخواني شوروي اتحاد يو جمهوريت ګڼل کېده چې په هغه وخت کې د [[ترکمن SSR|ترکمنستان سويت سوسياليستي جمهوريت]] په نامه يادېده. 

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د ترکمنستان تاريخ}}
The territory of Turkmenistan has a long and checkered history, as armies from one empire to another decamped on their way to more prosperous territories.

[[Alexander the Great]] conquered the territory in the 4th century [[Anno Domini|B.C.]] on his way to [[India]]. One hundred and fifty years later Persia's [[Parthian Kingdom]] established its capital in Nisa, an area now located in the suburbs of the modern-day capital of [[Ashgabat]]. In the 7th century [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] [[Arab]]s conquered this region, bringing with them [[Islam]] and incorporating the Turkmen into [[Middle East]]ern culture. It was around this time that the famous [[Silk Road]] was established as a major trading route between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].

The Turkmenistan region soon came to be known as the capital of ''Greater'' ''[[Khorasan]]'' when the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] moved his capital to [[Merv]].

In the middle of the 11th century, the powerful Turks of the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Empire]] concentrated their strength in the territory of Turkmenistan in an attempt to expand into Afghanistan. The empire broke down in the second half of the 12th century, and the Turkmen lost their independence when [[Genghis Khan]] took control of the eastern Caspian Sea region on his march west. For the next seven centuries, the Turkmen people lived under various empires and fought constant intertribal wars.  Little is documented of Turkmen history prior to Russian engagement, however from the 13th through 16th centuries, Turkmen formed a distinct entholinguistic group.  As the Turkmen migrated from the area around the Mangishlak peninsula in contemporary Kazakhstan toward the Iranian border region and Amu Darya river basin, tribal Turkmen society further developed cultural traditions that would become the foundation of Turkmen national consciousness.

By 1894 [[imperial Russia]] had taken control of Turkmenistan. The [[October Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia and subsequent political unrest led to the declaration of the Turkmen Republic as one of [[republics of the Soviet Union|the 15 republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1924]]. At this time the modern borders of Turkmenistan were formed.

In [[1991]], with the breakup of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan became independent. The former Soviet leader, [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], remains in power. His policies have changed greatly since Soviet times: He is friendly to foreign [[corporation]]s, he has rather tense relations with [[Moscow]] and he styles himself a promoter of [[tradition]]al, [[Muslim]], Turkmen culture. One thing that has not changed, however, is the extent of his power; if anything, his power has been greatly enhanced in the early 1990s thanks to the country's independence.

<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=ترکمنستان}}
'''Politics of Turkmenistan''' take place under a [[totalitarian]] dictatorship, whereby the [[President of Turkmenistan]], [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], retains absolute control over the country and opposition is not tolerated.

==بشري حقونه==
{{main|Human rights in Turkmenistan}}
[[Human rights]] issues in Turkmenistan, an authoritarian state, include [[freedom of religion]] issues. According to [[Forum 18]], despite international pressure, the authorities keep a very close eye on all religious groups and the legal framework is so constrictive that many prefer to exist underground rather than have to pass through all the official processes, which act as barriers. [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] adherents are affected, in addition to groups such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Hare Krishna]]. The [[Hare Krishna]] are not allowed to seek donations at the country's main airport, the [[Turkmenbashi Flying Aeroplane Station]].

According to the 2005 [[Reporters Without Borders]] ''World Press Freedom Index'', Turkmenistan had the 3rd worst [[press freedom]] conditions in the world. No one is allowed to describe the President or his family negatively. Also, no reporters are permitted to mention that the President is a very short man (barely over 5 feet), or that he wears a [[toupee]].

{{main|Provinces of Turkmenistan}}

Turkmenistan is divided into 5 provinces or ''welayatlar'' (singular - ''[[welayat]]'') and one independent city:

== جغرافيه ==
[[Image:Turkmenistan-map.png|thumb|300px|Map of Turkmenistan]]
{{main|د ترکمنستان جغرافيه}}
The country is approximately 488,100 square kilometers (188,457&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). 90% of the country is covered by the [[Karakum Desert]]. The center of country is dominated by [[Turan Depression]] and the Karakum Desert which are mostly flatlands. The [[Kopet Dag]] [[mountain range|Range]], along the southwestern border, reaches 2,912 meters (9,553&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The Turkmen Balkan Mountains in the far west and the Kugitang Range in the far east are the only other appreciable elevations. Rivers include the [[Amu Darya]], [[Murgap]], and the [[Hari Rud]].

The climate is [[subtropical]] desert, with little rainfall. Winters are mild and dry, with most precipitation falling between January and May. Heaviest precipitation is in the Kopetdag Range.

Other cities include: [[Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]] (formerly Krasnovodsk) and [[Daşoguz|Dashoguz]].

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|د ترکمنستان اقتصاد}}

One-half of its irrigated land is planted in [[cotton]], making it the world's 10th-largest producer; and it possesses the world's fifth-largest reserves of [[natural gas]] as well as substantial oil resources. In 1994, [[Russia]]'s refusal to export Turkmen gas to [[hard currency]] markets and mounting debts of its major customers in the former [[Soviet Union]] for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit.

Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. [[Privatization]] goals remain limited. Between 1998 and 2002, Turkmenistan has suffered from the continued lack of adequate [[export]] routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external [[debt]]. At the same time, however, the value of total exports has risen sharply because of higher international oil and gas prices. Economic prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal [[poverty]] and the burden of foreign debt.

President Niyazov has squandered much of his country's revenue on self-glorification, with cities, [[Ashgabat]] in particular, being given extensive renovations whilst the people living outside the capital struggle in conditions of poverty. Particular concern has been voiced by corruption watchdogs over the management of Turkmenistan's currency reserves, most of which seem to be held in off-budget funds such as the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund in Deutsche Bank Frankfurt, according to a report released in April 2006 by London-based NGO [[Global Witness]]. President Niyazov has pledged free water, electricity and gas; however, shortages are frequent.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Turkmen man with camel.jpg|thumb||250px|A [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] man in traditional clothes, around 1905–1915]]
{{main|Demographics of Turkmenistan}}
The majority of Turkmenistan's citizens are [[Turkmen people|ethnic Turkmen]]; other ethnic groups include [[Russians]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Azeris]], [[Armenians]] and [[Tatars]]. [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] is the [[official language]] of Turkmenistan, though [[Russian language|Russian]] still is widely spoken as a "language of inter-ethnic communication" (per the [[1992]] Constitution). The name Turkmen, both for the people and for the nation itself, is said to be self-referential from the period the Russians first encountered the people, parsing as ''Tūrk-men'', or "I am Tūrk".

Education is universal and mandatory through the secondary level, the total duration of which was recently reduced from 11 to 9 years.
