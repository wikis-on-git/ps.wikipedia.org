==History and development==
After the end of the Taliban government in 2002, a number of persons, amounting to ten individuals who had held positions in the previous government, formed a Council of Leaders (''Rabbari Shura''). These ten persons were: eight veteran high ranking (i.e. elite) commanders locating originally from the southern area of Afghanistan, another hailing from [[Paktika]], and another from the provinces of [[Paktia]]. The Shura was subsequently increased in number, during March 2003, to 33 individuals. During October 2006, the Consultative Council (''majlis al-shura'') was formed, comprising a number of advisors to 13 core members.<ref name="American Foreign Policy Council">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9fQ3AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1043&dq=Quetta+Shura&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE4Q6AEwB2oVChMI7dDp_JT7yAIVQrYaCh11pA7r#v=onepage&q=Quetta%20Shura&f=false|author=American Foreign Policy Council|title=The World Almanac of Islamism: 2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield, 30 Jan 2014, 1087 pages, ISBN 1442231440|accessdate=2015-11-06}}(this text is classified: [[Political Science]] › [[International Relations]])</ref>

==Accusations by Coalition Forces==

===Directing the insurgency in Afghanistan===
{{main|Taliban insurgency}}

According to retired General of the [[United States Army]], [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], the Quetta Shura is directing the Afghani Taliban [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]].<ref name=IAR />   In a report to President Obama in 2009, he stated that it posed the greatest threat to his troops. He said, "Afghanistan's insurgency is clearly supported from Pakistan. The Quetta Shura conducts a formal campaign review each winter, after which Mullah Omar announces his guidance and intent for the following year." Americans want to extend the [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone strikes]] into Balochistan.<ref name = guardian1>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/21/us-taliban-balochistan-strategy-pakistan Strategic Balochistan becomes a target in war against Taliban], [[The Guardian]], 2009-12-21</ref>

In September 2009 US ambassador to Pakistan [[Anne W. Patterson]] said, "In the past, we focussed on [[Al Qaeda]] because they were a threat to us. The Quetta Shura mattered less to us because we had no troops in the region, now our troops are there on the other side of the border, and the Quetta Shura is high on Washington’s list."<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/11-patterson-says-quetta-shura-high-on-us-list--il--09 Patterson says Quetta Shura high on US list], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-09-30</ref>

===Funding from Persian Gulf region===
The Taliban leaders raise money from wealthy Persian gulf donors and direct operations in south Afghanistan.<ref name=NYT1>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/asia/10quetta.html Taliban Haven in Pakistani City Raises Fears], [[The New York Times]], 2009-02-09</ref> According to Lt. Gen. [[David Barno]], the retired former commander of American forces in Afghanistan "The Quetta Shura is extremely important, they are the intellectual and ideological underpinnings of the Taliban insurgency."<ref name=NYT1/>

===Support from Pakistani intelligence===
American officials believe that the Quetta Shura gets support from parts of Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), as some of its senior officials believe that leaders such as [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] would be valuable assets if the Taliban were to regain power after a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/world/asia/24military.html Taliban Widen Afghan Attacks From Base in Pakistan], [[The New York Times]], 2009-09-24</ref>
According to Abdul Rahim Mandokhel, a Pakistani [[Senate of Pakistan|senator]] from [[Zhob]] in northern Balochistan. "The whole war in Afghanistan is being launched from here," he said. He accused Pakistan's intelligence agencies of carrying out a "double" policy. "One thing is clear: the area is being used for cross-border offences," he said.<ref name = guardian1/>

A report by the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the [[Taliban insurgency]] on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author [[Matt Waldman]] spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realised. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/10302946.stm|title=BBC News - Pakistani agents 'funding and training Afghan Taliban'|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/afghanistan/article7149089.ece|title=Login|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65C06620100613|title=Report says Pakistan meddling in Afghanistan|work=Reuters|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as "malicious".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/06/13/afghanistan.taliban.isi/|title=Pakistan dismisses report of continued Taliban ties|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Pakistan_Denies_Supporting_Taliban/2070224.html|title=Pakistan Denies Supporting Taliban|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>[[n:Pakistan's intelligence agency said to support Taliban|"Pakistan's intelligence agency said to support Taliban"]]</ref>

==Pakistani response==

===Denials===
American and western officials have long complained that Pakistan has ignored the presence of senior Taliban leadership in Quetta and done little to address this situation.<ref name=NYT1/><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/cantt-quetta.htm Quetta Cantonment], GlobalSecurity.org</ref> Pakistani authorities have denied the existence of such an organization in Pakistan.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7601748.stm The Afghan-Pakistan militant nexus], [[BBC]], 2009-12-01</ref> However statements by US officials have led to fears that US would launch [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone strikes]] on Quetta.<ref name=DAWN1>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/04-fear-grows-of-us-strikes-balochistan-qs-13 Fear grows of US strikes in Balochistan], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-10-12</ref> Jehan Zeb Jamaldini, senior vice president of [[Balochistan National Party]] was quoted as saying that Mullah Omar and his 2nd and 3rd tier leadership were around Quetta and would be targeted by the US.<ref name=DAWN1/>

===Acknowledgement===

In December 2009 Pakistani government for the first time acknowledged the existence of Quetta Shura. The Defence minister of Pakistan, [[Ahmad Mukhtar]] acknowledged the presence of Quetta Shura but stated that security forces had damaged it to such an extent that it no longer posed a threat.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-quetta-shura-ahmad-mukhtar-qs-04 Quetta shura no longer poses threat: Ahmad Mukhtar], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-12-11</ref>

On November 23, 2012, when Pakistan released nine senior Taliban leaders, commentator [[Ali K. Chrishti]] described a statement from the Pakistani government as its first acknowledgment of the existence of the Quetta Shura.<ref name=TheFridayTimes2012-11-24>

{{update|section|date=May 2011}}
In February 2010, in a possible change in Pakistani policy, several members of the Quetta Shura were detained at various locations in Pakistan.
Top [[Taliban]] leader [[Abdul Ghani Baradar]] who runs the Shura was captured in [[Karachi]] in a joint operation by [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/world/asia/16intel.html Secret Joint Raid Captures Taliban’s Top Commander], [[The New York Times]], 2010-02-15</ref> He had reportedly gone to Karachi to meet other Shura leaders who had moved to this city in recent months.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7029075.ece Profile: Mullah Baradar - father of the roadside IED], [[The Times]], 2010-02-16</ref> A few days later two more members of the Quetta Shura, [[Mullah]] [[Abdul Kabir]] and [[Mullah]] [[Mohammed Yunis]], the Taliban’s shadow governor of Zabul Province, were detained by Pakistani intelligence.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/world/asia/23islamabad.html Pakistani Reports Capture of Taliban Leader], [[The New York Times]], 2010-02-22</ref>

===Motivation===
Analysts are split on the question of why Pakistan has now moved against these key leaders. Many say that Pakistan has decided it wants to control any negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government.<ref>Washington and Kabul hint that the ISI’s goal seems to be to weaken the Taliban just enough to bring them to the negotiating table, but leaving them strong enough to represent Pakistani interests in a future Afghan government.
</ref><ref name="bbc-analysis">
"There has been a change in Pakistan's attitude," said Pakistani author Ahmed Rashid. "Pakistan now wants to dominate any kind of dialogue that takes place."

The policy shift was made after pressure from the US as well as a request from the [[House of Saud|Saudi Royal family]]<ref>[http://thenews.jang.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=27544 Pakistan wipes out half of Quetta Shura], [[The News International]], 2010-03-01</ref>

==Coalition efforts at negotiations==
In November 2009, it was reported that the British were pushing for talks between the Afghan government and the Shura. 'Major General [[Richard Barrons]] said negotiations with the senior echelons of the Afghan Taliban leadership council – the Quetta shura – were being looked at, alongside the reintegration of insurgency fighters into civilian life.  In his first interview since arriving in Afghanistan to begin talks with "moderate" Taliban fighters, Barrons said British officials were backing extensive talks between Karzai's government and the Quetta shura, which is led by Mullah Omar and is responsible for directing much of the fighting against British forces in Helmand province.'<ref>.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/29/afghanistan-withdrawal-summit-gordon-brown Afghanistan summit to plan for withdrawal], [[The Guardian]], 29 November 2009</ref>

Early January 2010, some commanders from the Quetta Shura held secret exploratory talks with [[Kai Eide]] to discuss peace terms, as emerged end of that month during the [[International Conference on Afghanistan London 2010|International Conference on Afghanistan in London]]. The Shura had sought a meeting with the United Nations envoy, which took place in [[Dubai]] on January 8, 2010. This was the first such meeting between the UN and alleged senior members of the Taliban, suggesting that peace talks had revived since exploratory contacts between emissaries of the Kabul government and the Taliban in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 2009 broke down. It was not clear how significant a faction had showed up in Dubai or how serious they were. A western official confirmed that there were ''indications of splits in the Taliban over the prospect of a settlement''.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/28/taliban-united-nations-afghanistan UN in secret peace talks with Taliban], [[The Guardian]], 28 January 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/world/asia/30reconcile.html "U.N.

According to ''[[The News International]]'', Pakistani security officials had previously regarded Afghanistan's Taliban, the Quetta Shura, and [[Tehrik-e-Taliban]] as three separate entities. They reported that Pakistani security officials had changed their policy in early 2010, and had decided to treat all three organizations as one organization, and to crack down on the Quetta Shura. The reported Nine of its eighteen leaders were captured in late February and early March 2010.
