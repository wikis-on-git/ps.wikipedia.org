'''پولنډبال''', يا پولنډ توپ چې د '''بېدياني توپ''' په نامه هم يادېږي، د يو کارن لخوا جوړشوی انټرنټي نښه ده چې په نړېواله توګه د الماني انځوريزې انټرنټپاڼې Krautchan.net په مخ د ۲۰۰۹ کال په دويمې نيمايۍ کې جوړ شو. دا ميمي يا څېره ګکه د نړېوالو کوميډي انځورکونو يوه لويه برخه جوړوي. په دې څېرې کې د يوه هېواد بېرغ د يوه ګردي توپ په بڼه جوړېږي او د يوه داسې کس ښکارندوی وي چې لومړنۍ ژبه يې انګرېزي نه وي او په ماته ګوډه انګرېزي ژبې خبرې کوي او په همدې ماتې ګوډې انګرېزي ژبې په نړېوالو اړيکو او ولسي کلېشو ملنډې وهي. دا ډول خنداوړ خبرو ته پولنډ بال وايي (که څه هم چې دا ضرور نه ده چې يو کرکټر د پولنډ نه وي) او يا هم بېديانی توپ چې په ټوله کې ورته بېدياني توپونه وييل کېږي.

==Background==
Polandball has its roots in an August 2009 'cyberwar' between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. The website, which offers a virtual canvas, allows Internet users to draw whatever they want, and to draw over others' drawings. On the [[Internet in Poland|Polish Internet]], an idea was raised to draw the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] on the ball, and thousands of Poles together managed to take over the drawball with a painting of white on top of red, with the word "[[Poland|POLSKA]]" written in the middle. After co-ordination from [[4chan]], this was then covered over by a giant [[Nazi swastika|swastika]].<ref name="gazeta">{{cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,86116,7462232,Wyniosle_lol_zaborcow__czyli_Polandball.html|title=Wyniosłe lol zaborców, czyli Polandball|last=Orliński|first=Wojciech|authorlink=Wojciech Orliński|date=16 January 2010|publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|language=Polish|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="cooltura">{{cite news|url=http://www.elondyn.co.uk/newsy,wpis,7731|title=Znowu lecą z nami w... kulki|last=Zapałowski|first=Radosław|date=15 February 2010|publisher=[[Cooltura]]|language=Polish|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref>

Krautchan.net is a German-language [[imageboard]] whose /INT/ board is frequented by English-speaking [[netizen]]s. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to ''Falco'', a Brit on /INT/, who in September 2009 created the meme using [[MS Paint]] in an apolitical way to [[troll (internet)|troll]] ''Wojak'', a Pole on the same board who contributes in [[wikt:broken English|broken English]], after which Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by [[Russians]].<ref name="gazeta" /><ref name="przeglad">{{cite news|url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/fenomem|title=Fenomem - Polska nie umieć kosmos|last=Kapiszewski|first=Kuba|date=13/2010|publisher=[[Przegląd]]|language=Polish|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="KYM">{{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/polandball|title=Polandball|publisher=[[Knowyourmeme]]|accessdate=26

The premise of Polandball, which gained in popularity in the wake of the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|crash in Smolensk]] which killed [[Polish President]] [[Lech Kaczyński]], is it represents Poland and its [[history of Poland|history]], [[Foreign relations of Poland|relations with other countries]], and [[stereotype]]s,<ref name="przeglad" /><ref name="hiro">{{cite news|url=http://hiro.pl/magazyn/magazyn_zjawiska/memy.html|title=MEMY.

Some Polandball comics arise from the premise that Russia can fly into space, whilst Poland can not. One of the most popular Polandball cartoons begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor, leading to all countries with [[space technology]] leaving Earth and going into [[orbit]] around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland, still on earth, is crying, and in broken English pronounces the canonical Polandball catchphrase "Poland cannot into space".<ref name="przeglad" /> In this [[Polish joke|humorous way]], Russians put a halt to all discussion with Poles on which country is superior.<ref name="gazeta"/><ref name="przeglad" /><ref name="hiro" /> In another Polandball comic which delves into historic-political [[satire]], Poland is seen to be boring other countryballs, with its proclamation of "So when we crushed Russia and the turks [sic] were were the biggest country in the world... and..", leading other countryballs to laugh at it. Poland, by now irritated, utters [[:wikt:kurwa|''kurwa'']], and holds up a sign saying "Internet serious business", which is an internet slogan used to deride others who treat subjects with disdain, and in Polandball convention, finishes by crying.<ref name="gazeta" /><ref name="cooltura" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/66ROeMOIC|title=Polandball cartoon|date=Unknown|publisher=Unknown|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>

Polandball can also include comics on other countries, but by convention these comics are usually still referred to as Polandball,<ref name="gazeta" /> although they can also be called countryballs.<ref name="KYM" /> According to [[Lurkmore.to]], [[Bavaria]] has its own ball, and other balls have been created for [[U.S. states]], [[Catalonia]] and [[Siberia]], amongst others. [[Singapore]] takes the form of a triangle and is called Tringapore; [[Israel]] takes the form of a [[hypercube]] (in reference to [[Jewish physics]]); [[Kazakhstan]] takes the form of a brick; and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] is shown wearing a [[top hat]] and [[monocle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lurkmore.to/index.php?title=Int&oldid=1561834#Polandball|title=Int|date=26 December 2011|publisher=[[Lurkmore.to]]|language=Russian|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>
