'''ولادمير ولادميروويچ پوتين''' ([[روسي ژبه|روسي]]: Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин, {{Audio|ru-Putin.ogg|pronunciation}}, ''Vladímir Vladímirovich Pútin''; born [[7 October]] [[1952]]) is a [[Politics of Russia|Russian politician]], and the current [[President of Russia|President]] of the [[Russian Federation]]. He succeeded [[Boris Yeltsin]] on [[December 31]], [[1999]]. 

== ژوند او کارونه ==
'''Vladimir Putin''' was born in [[Saint Petersburg]] (formerly called [[Leningrad]]). His autobiography, ''Ot Pervovo Litsa'', translated into [[English]] under the title ''First Person'' and based on interviews conducted with Putin in [[2000]], speaks of humble beginnings, including early years in a rat-infested [[tenement]] in a communal apartment. In his youth he was eager to emulate staunch intelligence officers, as enacted on [[Soviet]] screen by [[Vyacheslav Tikhonov]] and [[Georgiy Zhzhonov]].

In the same book, Putin notes that his paternal grandfather, a chef by profession, was brought to the Moscow suburbs to serve as a cook, at one of Stalin's [[dacha]]s. (In "The Court of the Red Tsar" by [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], a footnote on page 300 cites Putin as saying that while his grandfather did not discuss his work very often, he recalled serving meals to [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] as a boy and also prepared food for [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]).  His mother was a factory worker and his father was conscripted into the navy, where he served in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. His father subsequently served with the land forces during the Second World War. Two older brothers were born in the mid-1930's; one died within a few months of birth; the second succumbed to [[diphtheria]] during the [[siege of Leningrad]].

Putin graduated from the International Department of the Law Faculty of the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]] in [[1975]] and was recruited into the [[KGB]]. In ''First Person'', Putin described to journalists his early duties in the KGB, which included suppressing dissident activities in Leningrad. 

From [[1985]] to [[1990]] the KGB stationed Putin in [[East Germany]], in what he himself acknowledges was a minor position. Following the collapse of the [[East German]] regime, Putin was recalled to the Soviet Union and returned to Leningrad, where in June 1990 he assumed a position with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to the Vice-Rector. In June [[1991]] he was appointed head of the International Committee of the [[St Petersburg]] Mayor's office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments.

Putin formally resigned from the state security services on [[August 20]], [[1991]], during the abortive [[putsch]] against the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. In [[1994]] he became First Deputy Chairman of the city of Saint Petersburg, a position he retained until he was called to [[Moscow]], in August [[1996]], to serve in a variety of senior positions in Yeltsin's second Administration. He was head of the [[Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti|FSB]] (the successor agency to the KGB) from [[July]] [[1998]] to [[August]] [[1999]], and also served as Secretary of the Security Council March-August 1999.

== Prime Minister and first term as President ==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Yeltsin and Putin.jpg|right|left|thumb|Putin and his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.]] -->
Putin was appointed [[Chairman]] (predsedatel', or prime minister) of the Government of the Russian Federation by President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in August 1999, making him Russia's fifth prime minister in less than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, a virtual unknown, to last any longer than his predecessors. Yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors, Moscow Mayor [[Yuri Luzhkov]] and former Chairman of the Russian Government [[Yevgeniy Primakov]], were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Putin's law-and-order image and his unrelenting approach to the renewed crisis in Chechnya (see below) soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake all rivals. While not formally associated with any party, Putin was supported by the newly formed [[Edinstvo]] (unity) faction, which won the largest percentage of the popular vote in the December 1999 [[Duma]] elections. Putin was reappointed as Chairman of the Government, and seemed ideally positioned to win the presidency in elections due the following summer. His rise to Russia's highest office ended up being even more rapid: on [[December 31]], [[1999]], Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and appointed Putin the second ([[acting (law)|acting]]) President of the Russian Federation. Presidential elections were held  [[March 26]], [[2000]], which Putin won in the first round. In exchange for Yeltsin's support, Putin granted the former president and his family full immunity from prosecution. 

After years of scandal, erratic policy making and a general sense of national malaise under the aged, awkward and ailing Yeltsin, Putin's election appeared to mark a new beginning in Russia's post-Soviet history. Initially, however, the new president's election was due in no small measure to Yeltsin's inner circle, who had selected and supported Putin with a view to maintaining their own power and privilege. As Putin's new administration took shape, it was clear that members of the Yeltsin-era nomenklatura - including Chief of Staff [[Alexander Voloshin]] and Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]] - retained significant control over the policies and direction of the new government. On the other hand, Putin was also backed by a team of economic reformers from his native St Petersburg, and could rely as well on support from the ''siloviki''. (The latter group are defined as members of Russia's still-powerful security services, who regard themselves as the defenders of Russia's permanent national interests in the face of rapacious politicians and officials, and who are also well-informed about all aspects of Russia's political and economic life.) The tension – and cooperation – between these various groups was a central feature of Putin's first term in office. During Putin's presidency, Russia has gone from bankruptcy to a foreign reserves position of $170 bn, along with a budget reserve fund of $40 bn. As a result, Russia's credit rating has been lifted from SD (selective default) to investment grade by all three major rating agencies, despite the fact that according to the successor government doctrine of settled international law (which the Russian Federation itself has recognized), the Russian Federation remains in default on its debt to French holders of pre-1917 bonds for an amount they estimate to be in excess of EUR 100 billion, and which they are still claiming against Russia.

Upon his election, Putin undertook measures to restore the primacy of the Kremlin in Russia's political life. Under Yeltsin, Russia's 89 [[Subdivisions of Russia|sub-federal political territories]] (republics, oblasts, krai, and Moscow and St Petersburg) had been granted unprecedented autonomy. While this radical move had been intended to help Yeltsin's political maneuvers in the early 1990s, it also led to a highly irregular federalism and contributed to the growth of separatist movements, most notably in Chechnya. One of Putin's first acts, therefore, was to attempt to restore what he referred to as the "power vertical" – i.e. a return to the traditional top-down federal system. As a first step, Putin announced the appointment of seven presidential "plenipotentiary representatives" who were explicitly charged with coordinating federal activity in newly-defined super-regions. While billed as a seminal break with Yeltsin-era federalism, for a variety of reasons the plenipotentiary system has encountered mixed success. Of more lasting significance, Putin also instituted a major reform of Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. Putin and his team also entered into head-on confrontations with several uncooperative governors accused of [[political corruption|corruption]], though with only mixed success. 

The first months of Putin's first term were also marked by a settling of scores among elite financial-industrial groups, whose monetary resources and media empires had been critical weapons in the domestic political war that had been waged over the previous year. Leading members of the old Yeltsin group - known informally as "the Family" - were determined to punish the losing camp, headed by [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], which had backed the Primakov/Luzhkov ticket. Gusinsky had rendered himself vulnerable since his media empire was a chronic money loser and was deeply indebted, surviving on loans from Gazprom and the Luzkhov-controlled Bank of Moscow. Within a year of Putin's election, Gusinsky went from being a would-be kingmaker to living in self-imposed exile; his once-influential media conglomerate (Media-MOST) dissolved into bankruptcy due to a cut off in credits by state-owned and state-allied businesses and under the weight of criminal and civil court decisions. 

The first acute crisis which Putin faced as president arose in August 2000, when the Russian nuclear submarine [[Russian submarine Kursk|''Kursk'']] sank off the Kola peninsula, killing 118 sailors on board. Many people across a wide spectrum of Russian society were angered by the failure of the government and the military to release credible information about the scale and certainty of the disaster in first days of the tragedy. After several days of mounting public confusion and anger, Putin cut short his vacation and returned to Moscow to take charge of the crisis. Until the submarine was raised, the governmental commission of investigation into the disaster, took into account various versions including a collision with a "NATO" submarine (a theory that was never supported by evidence and which was firmly denied by the Alliance states). While Putin was criticised by the Russian media for his inaction during the initial stages of the crisis, it did not have a lasting effect on his image and popularity.

Putin has been unenthusiastic about erasing Russia's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] past from memory — the previous policy of [[Boris Yeltsin]] aimed primarily at his rival [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He has stated his belief that whatever the crimes of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] regime, it was nevertheless an important part of [[History of Russia|Russian history]] and has a formative influence on the creation of modern Russian society. As a result, some Soviet-era symbols have been allowed to return to Russia, such as the trademark red military flag, the "Soviet Star" crest, and the [[Hymn of the Soviet Union|Soviet national anthem]] (although with revised lyrics) – all of which have resonated well with the majority of Russia's population. Some media commentators in Russia have compared Putin to former Soviet leader [[Yuri Andropov]] due to perceived personality and leadership similarities. Putin has argued that he is the president of all Russians - including those such as the retirees who lost out in the post-Soviet transformation, and who understandably cling to symbols of the past.

A pro-Putin [[United Russia]] party won a landslide victory in the [[Russian legislative election, 2003|2003 parliamentary elections]]. Foreign observers called the election itself free, but noted that the largely government-run [[media]], especially Russian national TV, had massively and unfairly campaigned for the governing party only. Indeed, most Russian TV stations are now controlled directly or indirectly by the Kremlin. While reaching a much more limited audience, newspapers are more diverse; some are critical of the Kremlin, while others promote the government line. One of the two main business newspapers, [[Kommersant]], is controlled by [[Boris Berezovsky]], while the second - the highly respected [[Vedomosti]] - is co-owned by the [[Financial Times]] and the [[Wall Street Journal]]. Foreign media are freely available in Russia. 

Domestic and foreign critics accuse Putin of having orchestrated the trials of oligarchs such as [[Boris Berezovsky]], [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], and later [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] as part of an effort by his Kremlin to gain control over the media and large sectors of the Russian economy. For its part, Putin's administration has argued that its actions against the oligarchs are intended to contain and reverse serious damage inflicted on Russia's economy by years of insider capitalism.

On [[24 February]] [[2004]], less than a month prior to the elections, Putin dismissed Prime Minister Kasyanov and the entire Russian cabinet and appointed [[Viktor Khristenko]] acting prime minister. On [[March 1]], he appointed [[Mikhail Fradkov]] to the position.

== د ولسمشرۍ دويم پړاو ==
On [[March 14]], [[2004]], [[Russian presidential election, 2004|Putin won re-election]] to the presidency for a second term, earning 71 percent of the vote. Again, there was massive and one-sided campaigning for Putin by Russian television channels, most of which are state owned and controlled. Nevertheless, the election campaign and the actual balloting were both declared "free and fair" by an international observation mission run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Although Russian Presidents are not limited in the number of terms they can serve, they cannot serve for more than two successive terms. So Putin is not permitted under the present [[Constitution of Russian Federation]] to run for a third successive term in 2008 (following the [[2003]] parliamentary elections he gained a sufficient majority to change the Constitution, but so far has not announced any intention to do so).

On [[September 13]], [[2004]], following the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], and nearly-concurrent [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks in Moscow, Putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be proposed by the President and approved or disapproved by regional [[legislature]]s. Opponents of this measure, including [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], and [[Colin Powell]], criticised it as a step away from democracy in Russia and a return to the centrally run political apparatus of the Soviet era. Also on that day, Putin publicly backed a plan by the Central Elections Commission for the new proportional, and not mixed system, as before. In the previous system half of the 450 deputies in the Duma were elected based on proportional representation, while the other half of deputies are elected individually in single-member districts. This measure is also seen as the next step by the President towards consolidating power.

On [[April 25]], [[2005]], Putin caused some controversy when, in a nationally televised speech before the Duma, he referred to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] as "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century." This remark was critically received in the West and in some neighboring states; Putin subsequently clarified that he was not praising the former Soviet Union but rather highlighting in an altogether objective fashion the dramatic impact the collapse of the USSR had had on the world, particularly on the economic and social well-being of the populace from countries making up the former USSR [http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/aug1999/un-a05.shtml] and the displacement of people caused by the anti-Russian discrimination which subsequently began in many of these countries [http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/7251-3.cfm].

One of the most controversial aspects of Putin's second term was the prosecution of Russia's richest man, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], President of Yukos oil company. While much of the international press saw this as a reaction against a man who was funding political opponents of the Kremlin, both liberal and Communist, the Russian government has argued that Khodorkovsky was in fact engaged in corrupting a large segment of the Duma to prevent changes in the tax code aimed at taxing windfall profits and closing offshore tax evasion vehicles. Certainly, many of the initial privatizations, including that of Yukos, are widely believed to have been fraudulent (Yukos, valued at some $30bn in 2004, had been privatized for $110 million), and like the other oligarchic groups, the Yukos-Menatep name has been frequently associated with crimes.

== چيچېنيا ==
Putin's rise to public office coincided with an aggressive resurgence of the [[Second Chechen War|war in]] [[Chechnya]] in August 1999. Both in Russia and abroad, Putin's public image was forged by his tough handling of the dire challenge posed by Chechen extremists. During the bitter autumn 1999 campaign for the Duma, pro-Kremlin politicians and media accused Putin's chief rivals of being soft on terrorism, and ratcheted up accusations claiming that the Chechens' military campaign was being supported and supplied by Western intelligence agencies bent on humiliating and weakening Russia. On assuming the role of acting President on December 31, 1999, Putin proceeded on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in the North Caucasus; carefully orchestrated public relations coverage showed him presenting hunting knives to soldiers. Throughout the winter of 2000, Putin's government regularly claimed that victory was at hand. Human rights groups have consistently claimed that Russian forces and Chechen guerillas have both engaged in serious human-rights violations during the conflict, and doubts have been cast about the fairness of elections held there. In recent years, Putin has distanced himself from the management of the continuing conflict.

While President Putin is criticized as an [[autocrat]] by some of his Western counterparts, his relationships with US President [[George W. Bush]], former German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], French President [[Jacques Chirac]], and Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] are apparently friendly. Putin's relationship with Germany's new Chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], is expected to be "cooler" and "more business-like" than his partnership with Gerhard Schröder [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4618860.stm].

During his time in office, Putin has attempted to strengthen relations with other members of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. The "near abroad" zone of traditional Russian influence has again become a foreign policy priority under Putin, as the [[EU]] and [[NATO]] have grown to encompass much of [[Central Europe]] and, more recently, the [[Baltic states]]. While tacitly accepting the enlargement of NATO into the Baltic states, Putin attempted to increase Russia's influence over [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]].

Putin surprised many Russian nationalists and even his own defense minister when, in the wake of the [[September 11]] attacks in the United States, he agreed to the establishment of coalition military bases in Central Asia before and during the US-led Invasion of Afghanistan. Russian nationalists objected to the establishment of any US military presence on the territory of the former Soviet Union, and had expected Putin to keep the US out of the Central Asian republics, or at the very least extract a commitment from Washington to withdraw from these bases as soon as the immediate military purpose had passed.

During the [[Iraq crisis of 2003]], Putin opposed Washington's move to invade [[Iraq]] without the benefit of a [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force. After the official end of the war was announced, American president [[George W. Bush]] asked the United Nations to lift sanctions on [[Iraq]]. Putin supported lifting of the sanctions in due course, arguing that the [[United Nations|UN]] commission first be given a chance to complete its work on the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

During the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Ukrainian presidential election]], Putin visited Ukraine twice before the election to show his support for Ukrainian Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and congratulated him on his alleged victory before official election results. Putin's direct support for Yanukovych was criticized by some commentators as unwarranted interference in the affairs of independent Ukraine.

In 2005, Putin and former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder negotiated the construction of a major oil pipeline over the Baltic exclusively between Russia and Germany. Schröder also attended Putin's 53rd birthday in Saint Petersburg the same year.

== کورنۍ او شخصي ژوند ==
Putin is married to [[Lyudmila Putina]], a former airline stewardess and teacher of German, who was born in [[Kaliningrad]], (formerly [[Koenigsberg]]). They have two daughters,  Maria (born [[1985]]) and Yekaterina (Katya) (born [[1986]] in [[Dresden]]). The daughters attended the German School in Moscow (Deutsche Schule Moskau) until his appointment as prime minister.

Putin is a practicing member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. His conversion, which most observers agree was sincere, followed a life-threatening fire at his [[dacha]] in the early 1990s.

Putin speaks [[German language|German]] with near-native fluency, and has passable [[English language|English]].

== Activities ==
[[دوتنه:Vladimir Putin martial arts.jpg|thumb|left|120px|President [[Vladimir Putin]] throwing a sparring partner at a training session in [[Novo-Ogaryovo]], [[16 June]] [[2002]]]]
One of Putin's favorite sports is the martial art of [[judo]].  It has been stated that Putin began judo at the age of 13 and he continues to study judo even today.  Putin has won competitions in his hometown of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), including senior champion of Leningrad.  Now he is President of the Yawara Dojo, the same St. Petersburg dojo he studied at as a youth. Putin co-authored a book on his favorite sport, published in English under the title "Judo: History, Theory, Practice".

After a state visit to Japan, Putin was invited to the [[Kodokan Institute]] and showed the students and Japanese officials different judo techniques.  Though he is not the first world leader to practice judo,  Putin is the first leader to move forward in the advanced levels.  Currently, Putin is a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] (6th Degree) and is best known for his Harai goshi, a sweeping hip throw.

== Quotations ==
{{wikiquote}}
In response to US and EU leaders who have criticised Putin on taking a hardline in dealing with the Chechens ''"Why don't you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or to the White House and engage in talks, ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace? You find it possible to set some limitations in your dealings with these bastards, so why should we talk to people who are child-killers? No one has a moral right to tell us to talk to childkillers."''

"If you are a Christian, you are in danger. Even if you are an atheist, you are in danger, and if you decide to convert to Islam, this will not save you, either, because traditional Islam is inimical to the conditions and objectives set by them [the terrorists]. If you are prepared to become a most radical Islamist and are prepared to circumcise yourself, I invite you to come to Moscow. I will recommend having the operation done in such a way that nothing will grow for you there anymore." Putin snapping back at a reporter from Le Monde who asked a critical question about the conduct of the war in Chechnya, in November 2002. The quotation was rendered innocuous by his interpreter, but the original was recorded on audio and widely reprinted in Russia.

When a reporter asked Putin why his government didn't negotiate with the leaders of Chechen rebels, Putin answered ''"Russia doesn't negotiate with terrorists. [Russia] destroys them."''

When a reporter asked why he invited [[Hamas]] to the Kremlin for talks, Putin answered ''"Burning bridges - especially in politics - is the easiest, but not the most effective thing to do.  This is why we don't rush to declare an organisation to be terrorist, and try to work with everyone in this explosive region."''

After the tragedy of Beslan, Putin explained the failure of Russia's Security Services with the sentence ''"We were weak. And the weak are being beaten."''

Putin on Chechen extremists: "We'll follow terrorists everywhere. Should we catch them in a shithouse, we'll whack them in a shithouse." ("мочить в сортире" in Russian): [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1397914_2,00.html]

In response to criticism from US journalist [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] that his plan to end the direct election of governors and simply appoint them ran counter to the spirit of democracy, Putin replied:

:"The principle of appointing regional leaders is not a sign of a lack of democracy. For instance, India is called the largest world democracy. But their governors have always been appointed by the central government and nobody disputes that India is a democracy."

:"In the United States, you first elect the electors and then they vote for the presidential candidates. In Russia, the president is elected through the direct vote of the whole population. That might be even more democratic," Putin says.  "And you have other problems in your elections," he tells Wallace.  "Four years ago your presidential election was decided by the court. The judicial system was brought into it. But we're not going to poke our noses into your democratic system because that's up to the American people."

:After saying the US shouldn't have gone into Iraq in the first place: "But if the U.S. were to leave and abandon Iraq without establishing the grounds for a united and sovereign country, that would definitely be a second mistake."

<!-- To be honest 'Kukly' began yet in 1994 on [NTV Russia|NTV] national television channel. Scenarios were written by Victor Shenderovich. In 2001 the owner of NTV has changed, -- 'state' company Gazprom instead of nongov. "Media-Most" (Gusinsky and co). Most of NTV staff then left the channel and found work at channel "TV-6". (??? here i may lie.. TV-6 belonged to Gusinsky too, after a year or so???, the channel stopped existing, and now there is a "Sports" channel instead of old "TV-6"). "Kukly" has remained on NTV, but without Shenderovich. Then it went on for a year, until it was closed by NTV's bosses (???due to the low rating???).
