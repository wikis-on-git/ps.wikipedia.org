سحــــرګــه  وه  د  نـرګس  لېمه  لانده

څاڅکي  څاڅکي  يـــې  تـر  سترګو  څڅېده

مــا  ويـــل  څه  دي  ښکليې  ګله  ولي  ژاړې

ده  ويل  ژونـــد  مي  دئ  يوه  خوله  خندېده

She was a prominent learned poet and courteous person. Her father, Sultan Malakhai Tokhi, was also a prominent head of his tribe. In this way, Mirwais Khan inherited wisdom and political strength from both sides of his family. His father, Salim Khan, as head of his tribe was a rich businessman too. He sent caravans in route to Delhi, India and Isfahan in Persia. Nazo Anaa's father paid close attention to her education-and-upbringing and induced training-and-full education from the elders and learned personalities of the time in Kandahar. She became a prominent poet and literary figure of Pashtoo language. Her contribution as a poet is uniquely considered invaluable even today. 
On the night Mirwais was born (1673) his mother, Nazo Anaa, dreamed of Baitt Neeka (an ancient and famous benevolent leader of Afghans). He told Nazo to take best care of the new baby because when the child grows up, the country would be blessed by his services. Nazo Anaa, from time to time, recalled the miraculous dream to her son and advise him to perform deeds with authenticity. Young Mirwais eternally followed his mother's advice. He became a great leader for the people of Afghanistan.
