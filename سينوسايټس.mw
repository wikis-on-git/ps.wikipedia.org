Chronic sinusitis, by definition, lasts longer than three months and can be caused by many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include any combination of the following: [[nasal congestion]], facial pain, [[headache]], night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general [[malaise]], thick green or yellow [[Rhinorrhea|discharge]], feeling of facial 'fullness' or 'tightness' that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and/or [[halitosis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Each of these symptoms has multiple other possible causes, which should be considered and investigated as well. Unless complications occur, [[fever]] is not a feature of [[chronic sinusitis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Often chronic sinusitis can lead to [[anosmia]], a reduced sense of [[olfaction|smell]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In a small number of cases, acute or chronic [[maxillary sinus]]itis is associated with a dental infection. [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]], [[lightheadedness]], and [[blurred vision]] are not typical in chronic sinusitis and other causes should be investigated.

Chronic sinusitis cases are subdivided into cases with [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] and cases without polyps. When polyps are present, the condition is called chronic hyperplastic sinusitis; however, the causes are poorly understood<ref name=Leung2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Leung | first1 = R.S. | last2 = Katial | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = The Diagnosis and Management of Acute and Chronic Sinusitis | journal = Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.pop.2007.09.002 | url = http://cimed.ucr.ac.cr/archivos/Articulos%20Interes/2008/marzo/Diagnostico%20y%20Manejo%20de%20la%20Sinusitis%20Aguda.pdf | pmid = 18206715}}</ref> and may include allergy, environmental factors such as dust or pollution, bacterial infection, or fungus (either allergic, infective, or reactive). Non-allergic factors, such as [[vasomotor rhinitis]], can also cause chronic sinus problems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Abnormally narrow sinus passages, such as having a [[deviated septum]], can impede drainage from the sinus cavities and be a contributing factor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Chronic rhinosinusitis represents a multifactorial inflammatory disorder, rather than simply a persistent bacterial infection.<ref name="Leung2008"/> The medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis is now focused upon controlling the inflammation that predisposes patients to obstruction, reducing the incidence of infections. However, all forms of chronic rhinosinusitis are associated with impaired sinus drainage and secondary bacterial infections. Most individuals require initial antibiotics to clear any infection and intermittently afterwards to treat acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis.

A combination of [[anaerobic infections|anaerobic and aerobic bacteria]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Sinusitis |journal=Periodontol. 2000 |volume=49 |pages=126–39 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19152530 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.2008.00293.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0906-6713&date=2009&volume=49&spage=126}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I, Frazier EH |title=Bacteriology of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with nasal polyposis |journal=J.

Typically antibiotic treatment provides only a temporary reduction in inflammation, although hyperresponsiveness of the immune system to bacteria has been proposed as a possible cause of sinusitis with polyps (chronic hyperplastic sinusitis).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Attempts have been made to provide a more consistent nomenclature for subtypes of chronic sinusitis. The presence of [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]] in the mucous lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses has been demonstrated for many patients, and this has been termed Eosinophilic Mucin RhinoSinusitis (EMRS).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Cases of EMRS may be related to an allergic response, but allergy is not often documented, resulting in further subcategorization into allergic and non-allergic EMRS.

A more recent, and still debated, development in chronic sinusitis is the role that [[fungus]] plays in this disease. Fungus can be found in the nasal cavities and sinuses of most patients with sinusitis, but can also be found in healthy people as well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It remains unclear if fungus is a definite factor in the development of chronic sinusitis and if it is, what the difference may be between those who develop the disease and those who remain symptom free. Trials of antifungal treatments have had mixed results.

There are several paired paranasal sinuses, including the frontal, ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The [[ethmoid sinus]]es is further subdivided into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses, the division of which is defined as the basal [[:wikt:lamella|lamella]] of the middle [[turbinate]]. In addition to the severity of [[disease]], discussed below, sinusitis can be classified by the sinus cavity which it affects:

*[[Maxillary sinus|Maxillary]] – can cause [[pain]] or pressure in the maxillary ([[cheek]]) area (''e.g.,'' [[toothache]], [[headache]]) (J01.0/J32.0)
* [[Frontal sinus|Frontal]] – can cause pain or pressure in the [[frontal sinus]] cavity (located above eyes), [[headache]] (J01.1/J32.1)
* [[Ethmoid sinus|Ethmoid]] – can cause pain or pressure pain between/behind the [[Human eye|eyes]] and [[headache]]s (J01.2/J32.2)
*[[Sphenoid sinus|Sphenoid]] – can cause pain or pressure behind the [[Human eye|eye]]s, but often refers to the [[vertex (anatomy)|vertex]], or top of the [[head]]

Recent theories of sinusitis indicate that it often occurs as part of a spectrum of [[disease]]s that affect the [[respiratory tract]] (''i.e.'', the "one airway" theory) and is often linked to [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Grossman J | title = One airway, one disease | journal = Chest | volume = 111 | pages = 11S–16S | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1378/chest.111.2_Supplement.11S |pmid = 9042022 | issue = 2 Suppl }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Cruz AA | title = The 'united airways' require an holistic approach to management | journal = Allergy | volume = 60 |issue = 7 | pages = 871–4 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00858.x | pmid = 15932375 }}</ref> All forms of sinusitis may either result in, or be a part of, a generalized [[inflammation]] of the [[airway]], so other [[airway]] [[symptom]]s, such as [[cough]], may be associated with it.

Headache/facial pain or pressure of a dull, constant, or aching sort over the affected sinuses is common with both acute and chronic stages of sinusitis.  This pain is typically localized to the involved sinus and may worsen when the affected person bends over or when [[supine position|lying down]].  Pain often starts on one side of the head and progresses to both sides.<ref name="umm.edu">[http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_symptoms_of_sinusitis_000062_4.htm University of Maryland — Sinusitus Complications]</ref>
Acute and chronic sinusitis may be accompanied by thick nasal discharge that is usually green in color and may contain pus (purulent) and/or blood.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name="Sinusitis discharge1">{{cite web|last=Brook I|title=Sinusitis Understood |url=http://sinusitisunderstood.blogspot.com/p/epidemology-and-diagnosis.html }}{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}</ref><ref name="Sinusitis discharge2">{{cite web|title=Sinusitis|url=http://www.herbs2000.com/disorders/sinusitis.htm|publisher=herb2000.com|quote=Incidence of acute sinusitis almost always set in following the appearance of a cold for several days at a stretch in the person to the point that all the profuse nasal discharge turns a distinct yellow or a dark green color, or perhaps very thick, and foul-smelling in some cases.}}{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}</ref> Often a localized headache or [[toothache]] is present, and it is these symptoms that distinguish a sinus-related headache from other types of headaches, such as tension and migraine headaches. Infection of the eye socket is possible, which may result in the loss of sight and is accompanied by fever and severe illness.  Another possible complication is the infection of the bones ([[osteomyelitis]]) of the forehead and other facial bones – [[Pott's puffy tumor]].<ref name="umm.edu"/>

Sinus infections can also cause inner ear problems due to the congestion of the nasal passages. This can be demonstrated by dizziness, "a pressurized or heavy head", or vibrating sensations in the head.

Recent studies suggest that up to 90% of "sinus headaches" are actually [[migraines]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schreiber C, Hutchinson S, Webster C, Ames M, Richardson M, Powers C |title=Prevalence of migraine in patients with a history of self-reported or physician-diagnosed "sinus" headache |journal=Arch.

The close proximity of the brain to the sinuses makes the most dangerous complication of sinusitis, particularly involving the frontal and sphenoid sinuses, infection of the brain by the invasion of [[anaerobic organisms|anaerobic bacteria]] through the bones or blood vessels.

Factors which may [[:wikt:predisposition|predispose]] someone to developing sinusitis include: [[allergy|allergies]]; structural abnormalities, such as a [[deviated septum]], small [[sinus ostia]] or a [[concha bullosa]]; [[nasal polyp]]s; carrying the [[cystic fibrosis]] gene, though research is still tentative; and prior bouts of sinusitis, because each instance may result in increased inflammation of the nasal or sinus mucosa and potentially further narrow the nasal passageways.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

A small case-control study in 2010 suggests that [[second hand smoke]] could also be associated with chronic rhinosinusitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tammemagi CM, Davis RM, S Benninger M, Holm AL, Krajenta R |title=Secondhand smoke as a potential cause of chronic rhinosinusitis: a case-control study |journal=Arch.

Another cause of chronic sinusitis can be from the maxillary sinuses that are situated ''within'' the cheekbones. Infections and inflammation are more common here than in any of the other paranasal sinuses. This is because the drainage of mucous secretions from the maxillary sinus to the nasal cavity is not very efficient.

Maxillary sinusitis may also be of dental origin<ref>[http://www.lecourrierdudentiste.com/dossiers-du-mois/les-sinusites-maxillaires.html The maxillary sinusitis of dental origin: From diagnosis to treatment] Le courrier du dentiste</ref> and constitutes a significant percentage, given the intimacy of the relationship between the teeth and the sinus floor. Complementary tests based on conventional radiology techniques and modern technology are needed. Their indication is based on the clinical context.

Chronic sinusitis can also be caused indirectly through a common but slight abnormality within the auditory or [[Eustachian tube]], which is connected to the sinus cavities and the throat. This tube is usually almost level with the eye sockets but when this sometimes hereditary abnormality is present, it is below this level and sometimes level with the vestibule or nasal entrance. This almost always causes some sort of blockage within the sinus cavities ending in infection and usually resulting in chronic sinusitis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Bacterial and viral [[acute (medicine)|acute]] sinusitis are difficult to distinguish. However, if symptoms last less than 10 days, it is generally considered viral sinusitis. When symptoms last more than 10 days, it is considered bacterial sinusitis. Usually 30% to 50% of cases are bacterial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Nosocomial|Hospital acquired]] acute sinusitis can be confirmed by performing a [[CT scan]] of the sinuses.

===اوندن===
For sinusitis lasting more than eight weeks,<ref name="clevelandclinicmeded.com"/> diagnostic criteria are lacking. A [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] is recommended, but this alone is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis.  Nasal endoscopy, a [[CT scan]], and clinical symptoms are all used to make a positive diagnosis.<ref name=Leung2008/> A tissue sample for [[histology]] and [[cultures]] can also be collected and tested. Allergic [[fungal]] sinusitis (AFS) is often seen in people with asthma and [[nasal polyp]]s. Examining multiple [[biopsy]] samples can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name=Harrison>Harrison's Manual of Medicine 16/e</ref> In rare cases, [[sinusoscopy]] may be made.

Nasal endoscopy involves inserting a flexible fiber-optic tube with a light and camera at its tip into the nose to examine the nasal passages and sinuses. This is generally a completely painless (although uncomfortable) procedure which takes between five to ten minutes to complete.

For unconfirmed acute sinusitis, intranasal [[corticosteroids]] have not been found to be better than [[placebo]] either alone or in combination with antibiotics.<ref name=JAMA2007/> For cases confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy, treatment with corticosteroids alone or in combination with antibiotics is supported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zalmanovici A, Yaphe J |editor1-last=Zalmanovici Trestioreanu |editor1-first=Anca |title=Intranasal steroids for acute sinusitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD005149 |year=2009 |pmid=19821340 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub3 }}</ref> The benefit however is small.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayward G, Heneghan C, Perera R, Thompson M |title=Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Ann Fam Med |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2012 |pmid=22585889 |doi=10.1370/afm.1338 |url=}}</ref>

For chronic or recurring sinusitis, referral to an [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologist]] specialist may be indicated, and treatment options may include nasal surgery. Surgery should only be considered for those patients who do not experience sufficient relief from optimal medication.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Fokkens W, Lund V, Mullol J | title =European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2007 | journal =Rhinol Suppl. | volume =  16| issue =20 | pages =1–136 | year =2007 | pmid =17844873 | doi =10.1017/S0959774306000060}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinuses.com/faq.htm#surgery |title= FAQ — Sinusitis — WS Tichenor M.D. |accessdate=2007-10-28 |last=Tichenor |first=Wellington S. |date=2007-04-22 }}</ref>

Maxilliary antral washout involves puncturing the sinus and flushing with [[saline (medicine)|saline]] to clear the mucus.  A 1996 study of patients with chronic sinusitis found that washout confers no additional benefits over antiobiotics alone.<ref>{{cite pmid|8977854}}</ref>

A relatively recent advance in the treatment of sinusitis is a type of surgery called functional [[Endoscope|endoscopic]] sinus surgery ([[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery|FESS]]).  This surgery removes anatomical and pathological obstructions associated with sinusitis in order to restore normal clearance of the sinuses. This replaces prior open techniques requiring facial or oral incisions and refocuses the technique to the natural openings of the sinuses instead of promoting drainage by gravity, the idea upon which the Caldwell-Luc surgery was based.<ref>http://www.fasthealth.com/dictionary/c/Caldwell-Luc_operation.php</ref>

A number of surgical approaches can be used to access the sinuses and these have generally shifted from external/extranasal approaches to intranasal [[endoscopic]] ones.  The benefit of [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery|FESS]] is its ability to allow for a more targeted approach to the affected sinuses, reducing tissue disruption, and minimizing post-operative complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stammberger H |title=Endoscopic endonasal surgery—concepts in treatment of recurring rhinosinusitis. Part I. Anatomic and pathophysiologic considerations |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=143–7 |year=1986 |month=February |pmid=3083326 }}</ref>

Another recently developed treatment is [[sinuplasty (procedure)|balloon sinuplasty]]. This method, similar to [[balloon angioplasty]] used to "unclog" arteries of the heart, utilizes balloons in an attempt to expand the openings of the sinuses in a less invasive manner. The utility of this treatment for sinus disease is still under debate but appears promising.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

For persistent symptoms and disease in patients who have failed medical and the functional endoscopic approaches, older techniques can be used to address the inflammation of the maxillary sinus, such as the [[Caldwell-Luc radical antrostomy]].  This surgery involves an incision in the upper gum, opening in the anterior wall of the antrum, removal of the entire diseased maxillary sinus mucosa and drainage is allowed into [[inferior nasal meatus|inferior]]  or [[middle nasal meatus|middle meatus]] by creating a large window in the lateral nasal wall.<ref>Bailey and Love</ref>

Based on recent theories on the role that [[fungus]] may play in the development of chronic sinusitis, antifungal treatments have been used, on a trial basis. These trials have had mixed results.<ref name=Leung2008/>
