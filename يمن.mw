'''Yemen''', officially the '''Republic of Yemen''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الجمهورية اليمنية), composed of former [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], is a country on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in [[Southwest Asia]] and is a part of the [[Middle East]], bordering the [[Arabian Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aden]] on 
the south and the [[Red Sea]] on the west. It borders [[عمان]] to the northeast and [[سعودي عربستان]] elsewhere.  Its territory includes the remote island of [[Socotra]], about 350 kilometres (217 [[mile|mi]]) to the south off the coast of [[East Africa]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Yemen}}
[[دوتنه:Hajarin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The town of Hajarin, which features some of the oldest "skyscrapers" in the world - six story buildings made of mud bricks and mortar.]]
Yemen was one of the oldest centres of civilization in the Near East. Between the 9th century [[BC]] and the 6th century [[Anno Domini|AD]], it was part of the [[Minaean]], [[Sabaean]], [[Himyarite]], [[Qataban]]ian, [[Hadhramawt]]ian, and [[Awsan]]ian kingdoms, which controlled the lucrative spice trade. It was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as "Arabia Felix" ("Happy Arabia") because of the riches its trade generated; [[Augustus Caesar]] attempted to annex it, but the expedition failed; [[Persia]]n [[Monarch|kings]] were more successful and Yemen became a [[Sassanid]] Persian province in 597/8 under a Persian [[satrap]]. In the 6th and early 7th centuries, Yemen was successively incorporated into the Ethiopian and Persian Sassanid empires. In the [[7th century]], Islamic [[caliph]]s began to exert control over the area. After this caliphate broke up, the former north Yemen came under control of [[Imams]] of various dynasties usually of the [[Zaidi]] sect, who established a theocratic political structure that survived until modern times. (Imam is a religious term. The [[Shiites]] apply it to the prophet Muhammad's son-in-law Ali, his sons Hassan and Hussein, and subsequent lineal descendants, whom they consider to have been divinely ordained unclassified successors of the prophet.)

Egyptian [[Sunni]] Caliphs occupied much of north Yemen throughout the 11th century. By the [[16th century]] and again in the [[19th century]], north Yemen was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and in some periods its Imams exerted control over south Yemen.

[[North Yemen]] became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and became a republic in 1962. The British, who had set up a protective area around the southern port of [[Aden]] in the [[19th century]], withdrew in 1967 from what became [[South Yemen]]. In 1970, the southern government adopted a [[Communist]] governmental system. The two countries were formally [[political union|united]] as the Republic of Yemen on [[May 22]], [[1990]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Yemen}}

Yemen is a republic with a [[bicameral]] legislature. Under the constitution, an elected president, an elected 301-seat House of Representatives, and an appointed 111-member [[Shura|Shura Council]] share power. The president is head of state, and the prime minister is head of government. The constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by Parliament; the prime minister is appointed by the president. The presidential term of office is 7 years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is 6 years. Suffrage is universal over 18.

[[President of Yemen|President]] [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] was elected in 1999; the next presidential elections are scheduled for 2006 in which President Saleh does not intend to run, although a survey indicates that 86% of the population still wants him to.{{citation needed}} In April 2003 parliamentary elections, the [[General People's Congress]] (GPC) maintained an absolute majority. International observers judged elections to be generally free and fair, and there was a marked decrease from previous years in election-related violence; however, there were some problems with underage voting, confiscation of ballot boxes, voter intimidation, and election-related violence.

The constitution calls for an independent judiciary. The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified. The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in [[Sanaá]]. Since the country is an Islamic state, the Islamic holy book, the [[Koran]], is the basis for all laws, and no law may contradict the [[Koran]]. Indeed many court cases are debated by the religious basis of the laws i.e. by interpretations of the [[Koran]]. For this reason, many Judges are religious scholars as well as legal authorities.  Unlike Saudi Arabia and other Islamic states, the consumption of alcohol by foreigners is tolerated, and the mild narcotic [[Khat|Qat]] is chewed by Yemenis of all strata of society, despite being banned or frowned upon by other Islamic countries and groups.

Recently Mr. Ali Saif Hassan, a member of the Political Develpement Forum[http://www.pdf-yemen.com] in Yemen, spoke in the "Dissent and Reform in the Arab World" forum that was hosted by the AEI (American Enterprise Institute).

== Governorates ==
{{main|Governorates of Yemen}}
As of January 2004, Yemen is divided into 21 [[governorate]]s (20 proper governorates and a municipality) ([http://www.statoids.com/uye.html].  The size, in terms of population, of each governorate is as follows:

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Yemen}}
[[دوتنه:Yemen-map.gif|thumb|Map of Yemen]]

Yemen is in the [[Middle East]], in the south of [[Arabia]], bordering the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Gulf of Aden]], and [[Red Sea]], west of [[Oman]] and south of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is considered to be one of the fifteen states that comprise the [[Cradle of Humanity]]. 

The [[Red Sea]] islands: [[Hanish Islands]], [[Kamaran]] and [[Perim]] as well as [[Socotra]] in the [[Arabian Sea]] belong to the Yemen

Until recently its northern border was undefined because the [[Arabian Desert]] prevented any human habitation there.

The country can be divided geographically into four main regions: the coastal plains in the west, the western highlands, the eastern highlands, and the [[Rub al Khali]] in the east.

The Tihamah ("hot lands") form a very arid and flat coastal plain. Despite the aridity, the presence of many [[lagoon]]s makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for [[malaria]]l [[mosquito]]es. There are also extensive crescent-shaped [[sand dune]]s. The evaporation in the Tihama is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive [[groundwater]] reserves - which today are heavily exploited for agricultural use. 

The Tihamah ends abruptly at the escarpment of the western highlands. This area, now heavily [[terracing|terraced]] to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from 100[[millimetre|mm]] (4 [[inch]]es) per year to about 760mm (30 inches) in [[Ta'izz]] and over 1000mm (40 inches) in [[Ibb]]. Agriculture here is very diverse, with such crops as [[sorghum]] dominating, but [[cotton]] and many [[fruit]] trees are also grown, with [[mango]]es being the most valuable. Temperatures are hot in the day but fall dramatically at night. There are perennial streams in the highlands but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihama.

[[دوتنه:Sanaa.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Sanaá]], the capital of Yemen.]]
The central highlands are a extensive high plateau over 2,000 metres (6,560 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Diurnal temperature ranges are among the highest in the world: ranges from 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) in the day to 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) at night are normal. Water storage allows for [[irrigation]] and the growing of [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. [[Sana'a]] is located in this region. The highest point in Yemen is Jabal an Nabi Shu'aya, at 3,760 meters (12,336&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

The [[Rub al Khali]] in the East is much lower, generally below 1,000 metres, and receives almost no rain. It is populated only by Bedouin herders of [[Arabian Camel|camels]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Yemen}}

In terms of [[GDP per capita]], Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world and one of the poorest nations in the world. At unification, both the YAR and the PDRY were struggling, underdeveloped economies. In the north, disruptions of civil war (1962-70) and frequent periods of [[drought]] had dealt severe blows to a previously prosperous agricultural sector. [[Coffee]], formerly the north's main export and principal form of foreign exchange, declined as the cultivation of [[khat|qat]] increased. Low domestic industrial output and a lack of raw materials made the YAR dependent on a wide variety of imports.

Remittances from Yemenis working abroad and [[foreign aid]] paid for perennial trade deficits. Substantial Yemeni communities exist in many countries of the world, including Yemen's immediate neighbors on the Arabian Peninsula, [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[East Africa]], and also the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Beginning in the mid-[[1950]]s, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] provided large-scale assistance.

In the south, pre-independence economic activity was overwhelmingly concentrated in the port city of Aden. The seaborne transit trade, which the port relied upon, collapsed with the closure of the [[Suez Canal]] and Britain's withdrawal from Aden in [[1967]]. 

Since unification, the government has worked to integrate two relatively disparate economic systems. However, severe shocks, including the return in 1990 of approximately 850,000 Yemenis from the Gulf states, a subsequent major reduction of aid flows, and internal political disputes culminating in the 1994 civil war hampered economic growth. Yemen, the fastest growing democracy in the Middle East, is attempting to climb into the middle human development region through ongoing political and economic reform. 

Since the conclusion of the war, the government entered into agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to implement a structural adjustment program. Phase one of the IMF program included major financial and monetary reforms, including floating the currency, reducing the budget deficit, and cutting subsidies. Phase two will address structural issues such as civil service reform. The [[World Bank]] also is active in Yemen, with 22 active projects in 2004, including projects to improve governance in the public sector, water, and education. Since 1998, the government of Yemen has sought to implement World Bank economic and fiscal recommendations. In subsequent years, Yemen has lowered its debt burden through Paris Club agreements and restructuring U.S. foreign debt. In [[2003]], government reserves reached $5 billion.

The main oil produced and used in Yemen is Marib oil. Marib oil contains associated [[natural gas]]. Proven reserves of 10 to 13 trillion [[cubic feet]] (283 to 368 km³) could sustain a liquid natural gas (LNG) export project.

== Foreign relations ==
The geography and ruling Imams of [[north Yemen]] kept the country isolated from foreign influence before 1962. The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the Taif Agreement of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in [[1995]]. Relations with the British colonial authorities in [[Aden]] and the south were usually tense.

The Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in [[1958]] and [[1959]] were the first important non-Muslim presence in north Yemen. Following the September [[1962]] revolution, the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt. Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until [[1970]]. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia provided Yemen substantial budgetary and project support. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government. Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis found employment in Saudi Arabia during the late [[1970]]s and [[1980]]s.

In February [[1989]], north Yemen joined [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]] in forming the [[Arab Cooperation Council]] (ACC), an organization created partly in response to the founding of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], and intended to foster closer economic cooperation and integration among its members. After unification, the Republic of Yemen was accepted as a member of the ACC in place of its YAR predecessor. In the wake of the Gulf crisis, the ACC has remained inactive. Yemen is not a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

British authorities left southern Yemen in November [[1967]] in the wake of an intense rebellion. The [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], the successor to British colonial rule, had diplomatic relations with many nations, but its major links were with the Soviet Union and other [[Marxism|Marxist]] countries. Relations between it and the conservative Arab states of the Arabian Peninsula were strained. There were military clashes with Saudi Arabia in 1969 and 1973, and the PDRY provided active support for the [[Dhofar]] rebellion against the Sultanate of Oman. The PDRY was the only Arab state to vote against admitting new Arab states from the Persian Gulf area to the United Nations and the Arab League. The PDRY provided sanctuary and material support to various insurgent groups around the Middle East.

Yemen is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Yemen participates in the nonaligned movement. The Republic of Yemen accepted responsibility for all treaties and debts of its predecessors, the YAR and the PDRY. Yemen has acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Gulf crisis dramatically affected Yemen's foreign relations. As a member of the UN Security Council (UNSC) for [[1990]] and [[1991]],Yemen abstained on a number of UNSC resolutions concerning Iraq and Kuwait and voted against the "use of force resolution." Western and Gulf Arab states reacted by curtailing or canceling aid programs and diplomatic contacts. At least 850,000 Yemenis returned from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.

Subsequent to the liberation of [[Kuwait]], Yemen continued to maintain high-level contacts with Iraq. This hampered its efforts to rejoin the Arab mainstream and to mend fences with its immediate neighbors. In 1993, Yemen launched an unsuccessful diplomatic offensive to restore relations with its Persian Gulf neighbors. Some of its aggrieved neighbors actively aided the south during the 1994 civil war. Since the end of that conflict, tangible progress has been made on the diplomatic front in restoring normal relations with Yemen's neighbors. The Omani-Yemeni border has been officially demarcated. In the summer of 2000, Yemen and Saudi Arabia signed an International Border Treaty settling a 50-year-old dispute over the location of the border between the two countries. Yemen settled its dispute with [[Eritrea]] over the [[Hanish Islands]] in 1998.

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:Yemenite merchants.jpg|thumb|400px|Yemeni men at market]]
{{main|Demographics of Yemen}}

Unlike other people of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] who have historically been nomads or semi-nomads, Yemenis are almost entirely sedentary and live in small villages and towns scattered throughout the highlands and coastal regions.

Yemenis are divided into two principal Islamic religious groups: 42% Shi'i and 55% Sunni.  30-35% of the Zaidi order of Shi'a Islam, 7-12% of the Ja'fari and Isma'ili orders of Shi'a Islam, 55% of the Shafi'i order of Sunni Islam.

The Shi'is are predominantly in the north and northwest of Yemen whilst the Sunnis are predominantly in the south and southeast.

Yemenis are mainly of Semitic origin. Arabic is the official language, although English is increasingly understood in major cities. In the [[Mahra]] area (the extreme east), several non-Arabic languages are spoken. When the former states of north and south Yemen were established, most resident minority groups departed.

The [[Yemenite Jews]] once formed a sizeable Jewish minority in Yemen with a distinct culture.  This community is reduced to a few hundred individuals, following the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]].

The country has one of the world's highest birth rates; the average Yemeni woman bears seven children. Although this is similar to the rate in [[Somalia]] to the south, it is roughly twice as high as that of Saudi Arabia and nearly three times as high as those in the more modernized Persian Gulf states.

== Languages ==
{{main|Languages of Yemen}}
While the national language is Arabic (spoken in several regional dialects), Yemen is one of the main homelands of the [[South Semitic]] family of languages, which  includes the non-Arabic language of the ancient Sabaean Kingdom.  Its modern Yemeni descendents are closely related to the modern Semitic languages of [[Eritrea]] (Tigrinya) and [[Ethiopia]] (Amharic).  However, only a small remnant of those languages exists in modern Yemen, notably on the island of [[Socotra]] and in the back hills of the [[Hadhramaut]] coastal region.  Modern [[South Arabian]] languages spoken in Yemen include [[Mehri language|Mehri]], with 70,643 speakers, [[Soqotri language|Soqotri]], with an estimated 43,000 speakers (2004 census) mainly on the island of [[Socotra]], and [[Bathari language|Bathari]] (with an estimated total of only 200 speakers).

English is used as foreign language and is taught in public schools, starting from grade 7, though the quality of instruction is suspect in public school. Private schools using a British or American system teach English and produce the most proficient English speakers in Yemen, but Arabic is the main language of communication. The new generation is proud to learn English, but the availability of English speakers is small compared to other Arab countries such as Egypt, Lebanon, UAE and Saudi Arabia.
