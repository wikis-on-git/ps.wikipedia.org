'''ايران''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ايران, ''Īrān''), formerly called '''Persia''', is a [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] country located in [[Western Asia]]. Northern Iran is also a part of the [[Caucasus]]. It borders [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] (including its [[Nakhichevan exclave]]), and [[Turkmenistan]] to the north, [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] to the east, and [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]] to the west. In addition, it borders the [[Persian Gulf]] across which lie [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The official name of the country is the '''Islamic Republic of Iran''', and a citizen of Iran is called '''Iranian'''. Since the [[Iranian Revolution]] in [[1979]], when the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] transformed Iran into a [[theocracy]], [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]] has been the official [[state religion]].

Throughout history, Iran has been of great [[geostrategic]] importance due to its position between the [[Middle East]], [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] and its proximity to [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]]. 

Iran is currently lead by [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]] and [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. Iran is a member of [[OPEC]] and is important in [[international politics]] due to its large [[oil supply|supply]] of [[petroleum]].  Recently, controversy has erupted over [[Iran's nuclear program]].
==Name==
:''Main article: [[Iran naming dispute]]''

Ever since the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] period, Persian-speaking Iranians have referred to their country as ''Iran'', which means ''Land of the [[Aryan#Iranian|Aryans]]''. The Greeks called the country Persis; this passed into Latin as ''[[Persian Empire|Persia]]'', which has been the name most used in the West.  <ref>http://www.bartleby.com/61/99/A0449900.html</ref> <ref>http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/february/indoIranianBranch.html</ref> <ref>http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~aoliai/languagepage/iranianlanguages.htm</ref>. 

On [[March 21]] [[1935]] [[Reza Pahlavi|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term ''Iran'' in formal correspondence. After Persian scholars protested, [[Mohammad Reza Shah]] in 1959 announced that both ''Persia'' and ''Iran'' could be used interchangeably. 

The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 ultimately led to the establishment of a [[theocratic]] [[Islamic Republic]]. The country's   political title was changed to the ''Islamic Republic of Iran''.

==History==
{{main|History of Iran}}
[[Image:Takht-jamshid.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The 2500 year old ruins of [[Persepolis]].]]

Written history in Iran begins with the Jirfoft Kingdom around [[5000 BCE]], and continues with the arrival of the [[Aryans]] and the establishment of the [[Median dynasty]]. The [[Achaemenid]]s followed by building the [[Persian Empire]], under [[Cyrus the Great]] in [[546 BCE]]. The name ''Persia'' is derived from ''Persis'', the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the empire, although [[Eratosthenes]] also mentions the name "Iran". [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Persia in [[331 BCE]], soon only to be succeeded by the [[Parthia|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] dynasties, which followed the [[Achaemenid]]s as Persia's greatest pre-[[Islamic]] empires. 

The [[Middle Ages]] saw the unfolding of many critical events such as the [[Islamic Conquest of Iran]], the destruction of Iran under the [[Military advances of Genghis Khan|Mongol invasion]] beginning in 1220, the conquest of [[Tamerlane]], and the establishment of Iran's first [[Shi'a]] [[Islam|Islamic]] state under the [[Safavids|Safavid dynasty]] in 1501. From then on Persia increasingly became the arena for rival colonial powers such as [[Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. With the arrival of [[modernization]] in the late [[19th century]], Iranians longed for a change and thus the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1905/1911 followed.

[[Image:Mahan asemoon.jpg|thumb|right|[[9th century|9th]]-[[11th century|11th]] century Persia was at the center of what came to be known as the [[Golden Age of Islam]].]]

In 1953 Iran's [[prime minister]] Dr. [[Mohammed Mossadegh]], was removed from power in a plot orchestrated by British and [[United States|U.S.]] intelligence agencies to protect their oil interests (''dubbed "[[Operation Ajax]]"''). The operation was conducted following the Prime-Minister's [[nationalization]] of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. It reinstated the Iranian monarchy, handing power back to former Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran|Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].

Following Dr. Mosaddegh's fall, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran|Shah]]'s rule became increasingly [[dictator]]ial, particularly in the late [[1970s]]. With strong support from the [[United States|USA]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the Shah further modernized Iranian industry but crushed [[civil liberties]]. His [[autocracy|autocratic]] rule led to the [[Iranian revolution]] in 1979. An [[Islamic republic]] was soon established under the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

The new [[theocracy|theocratic]] political system instituted some [[conservative]] Islamic [[reforms]] as well as introducing an unprecedented level of direct [[cleric]]al rule. It also engaged in an anti-Western course due to Western support of the [[Shah]]. In particular Iranian-American relations were severely strained after the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian seizure of U.S. embassy personnel in 1979]], Iran's subsequent attempts to export its revolution, and its support of anti-Western militant groups such as [[Hezbollah|Lebanese Hezbollah]].

In 1980 Iran was attacked by neighbouring [[Iraq]] and the destructive [[Iran-Iraq War]] continued until 1988. The struggle between the reformists and conservatives over the future of the country continues today through [[electoral]] politics and was a central Western focus in the 2005 elections where conservative candidate [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] triumphed.

== Government and Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Iran}}

Iran defines itself and is widely viewed as a [[constitutional]] Islamic [[Republic]], whose political system is laid out in the 1979 [[constitution]] called ''Qanun-e Asasi'' (literally 'Fundamental Law'). Iran's makeup has several intricately connected governing bodies, some of which are [[democratic]]ally elected and some of which are appointed.  Some political scientists might argue that the structure of the government is actually more in line with an [[elective monarchy]], as the Supreme Leader is elected and rules for life with broad powers.  If viewed from this perspective, Iran would be the largest elective monarchy in the world.

====The Supreme Leader====
[[Image:Azadi1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azadi Tower]] ''("Tower of Freedom")'']]

The concept of ''[[velayat-e faqih]]'' (guardianship of the [[jurist]]) plays a crucial role in the governmental structure of Iran. <ref>http://www.kadivar.com/Htm/English/Papers/Velayat-e%20Faghih.htm</ref> According to the Constitution, the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] is responsible for the delineation and supervision of "the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran." In the absence of a single leader, a council of religious leaders is appointed. The Supreme Leader is ''commander-in-chief'' of the armed forces and controls the Islamic Republic's intelligence and security operations; he alone can declare war. He has the power to appoint and dismiss the leaders of the judiciary, the state radio and television networks, and the supreme commander of the ''[[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]].'' He also appoints six of the twelve members of the [[Council of Guardians]]. He, or the council of religious leaders, are elected by the ''Assembly of Experts'', on the basis of their qualifications and the high popular esteem in which they are held. <ref>http://countrystudies.us/iran/81.htm</ref>  The Supreme Leader is arguably an elected monarch (see [[elective monarchy]]), by the definition of that term.

====The President====
The [[President of Iran]] is responsible for implementing the Constitution and acting as the head of the executive, except in matters directly concerned with (the office of) the Leadership. According to the law, all presidential candidates must be approved by the [[Council of Guardians]] prior to running, after which he is elected by [[universal suffrage]] to a four-year term by an absolute majority of votes. After his election, the president appoints and supervises the [[List of current Iranian officials|''Council of Ministers'' (the  cabinet)]], coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the Parliament. Eight vice presidents serve under the president, as well as a cabinet of twenty-one ministers. The Council of Ministers must be confirmed by Parliament. Unlike many other states, the executive branch in Iran does not control the armed forces.

====The Parliament (''The Majles'')====
[[Image:Jalaseh Majles.jpg|right|thumb|[[Majlis of Iran|Parliament]] of The Islamic Republic of Iran.]]

The [[unicameral]] [[Majlis of Iran|Iranian parliament]], the Islamic Consultative Assembly or "Majles-e Shura-ye Eslami", consists of 290 members elected to a four-year term. The members are elected by direct and [[secret ballot]]. It drafts [[legislation]], ratifies international [[treaties]], and approves the country's budget. All [[Member of Parliament|MP]] candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the [[Council of Guardians]].

====The Assembly of Experts====
The [[Assembly of Experts]], which meets for one week every year, consists of eighty-six "virtuous and learned" [[cleric]]s elected by the public to eight-year terms. Like presidential and parliamentary elections, the [[Council of Guardians]] determines eligibility to run for a seat in this assembly. 

Members of the Assembly of Experts in turn elect the [[Supreme Leader]]. The assembly has never been known to challenge any of the Supreme Leader's decisions, although according to the Iranian constitution it has the authority to remove the Supreme Leader from power at any time.

====The Council of Guardians====
Twelve jurists comprise the [[Council of Guardians]], six of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The head of the judiciary recommends the remaining six, which are officially appointed by [[Majles|Parliament]]. 

The Council of Guardians is vested with the authority to interpret the constitution and determines if the laws passed by Parliament are in line with ''[[sharia]]'' (Islamic law). Hence the council can exercise [[veto power]] over Parliament. If a law passed by Parliament is deemed incompatible with the ''constitution'' or ''sharia'', it is referred back to Parliament for revision.

In a controversial excercise of its authority, the Council has drawn upon a narrow interpretation of the Iranian constitution to veto parliamentary candidates.  See [[Council of Guardians]].

====The Expediency Council====
The [[Expediency Discernment Council|Expediency Council]] has the authority to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians, and serves as an advisory body to the Supreme Leader, making it one of the most powerful governing bodies in the country.

====The Judiciary====
{{main|Judicial system of Iran}}

The head of the Judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader, who in turn appoints the head of the Supreme Court and the chief public prosecutor. 

Public courts deal with civil and criminal cases. "Revolutionary" courts try certain categories of offenses, including crimes against [[national security]]. Decisions rendered in revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed. 

The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by [[cleric]]s, although it has also taken on cases involving [[lay people]]. The rulings of the Special Clerical Court, which functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader, are also final and cannot be appealed

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Iran}}
[[Image:Iran map.png|framed|Map of Iran]]

Iran borders [[Azerbaijan]] (length of border: 432 km / 268 mi) and [[Armenia]] (35 km / 22 mi) to the northwest, the [[Caspian Sea]] to the north, [[Turkmenistan]] (992 km / 616 mi) to the northeast, [[Pakistan]] (909 km / 565 mi) and [[Afghanistan]] (936 km / 582 mi) to the east, [[Turkey]] (499 km / 310 mi) and [[Iraq]] (1,458 km / 906 mi) to the west, and finally the waters of the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to the south. Iran's total land mass is 1,648,000 km² / ≈636,300 mi² (Land: 1,636,000 km² / ≈631,663 mi², Water: 12,000 km² / ≈4,633 mi²). That is approximately the land mass of [[Alaska]].

Iran's landscape is dominated by rugged [[mountain range]]s that separate various [[drainage basin|basins]] or [[plateau]]s from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]] and [[Alborz]] Mountains, the latter of which also contains Iran's highest point, the [[Mount Damavand|Damavand]] at 5,604 [[metre]]s (18,386&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The eastern half consists mostly of uninhabited [[desert]] basins like the saline [[Dasht-e Kavir]], with the occasional [[salt lake]]. 

[[Image:Damavand.jpg|left|thumb|Iran's highest mountain, [[Mount Damavand]], standing at 5,604 m (18,286&nbsp;ft)]]

The only large [[plain]]s are found along the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] and at the northern end of the [[Persian Gulf]], where Iran borders on the mouth of the [[Arvand]] river (''[[Shatt al-Arab]]''). Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and the [[Sea of Oman]]. The Iranian [[climate]] is mostly [[arid]] or [[semiarid]], though [[subtropical]] along the Caspian coast. Iran is considered one of the fifteen states that comprise the so-called "[[Cradle of Humanity]]".

===Climate===
[[Image:Dena-kuh.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Zagros Mountains]] are Iran's second largest range in territory. Dena Mountain, rises 4,359 m (14,301&nbsp;ft)]]

Iran's landscape produces several different [[climate]]s. On the northern edge of the country (the Caspian coastal plain) the temperatures nearly fall below freezing and remain humid for the rest of the year. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 29°[[Celsius|C]] (84°[[Fahrenheit|F]]). Annual precipitation is 680 [[millimetre]]s (26&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in the eastern part of the plain and more than 1,700 millimetres (75&nbsp;in) in the western side of the plain. To the west, settlements in the Zagros Mountains basin experience lower temperatures. These areas have severe winters, with average daily temperatures below freezing and have heavy snowfall. The eastern and central basins are arid. They get less than 200 millimetres (8&nbsp;in) of rain and have occasional desert. The average summer temperatures exceed 38°C (100°F). The coastal plains of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman in southern Iran have mild winters, experience very humid, and hot summers. The annual precipitation ranges from 135 to 355 millimetres (6 to 14 in).

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Iran}}
[[Image:1000tomani.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''[[Iranian rial|Rial]]'' is Iran's official currency.]]

Iran's economy is a mixture of [[central planning]], [[state ownership]] of [[petroleum|oil]] and other large [[enterprise]]s, village [[agriculture]], and small-scale [[private trading]] and service ventures. The current [[administration]] has continued to follow the market reform plans of the previous one and has indicated that it will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy. The Iranian government is attempting to diversify by [[Investment|investing]] revenues in other areas, including, [[car]] [[manufacturing]], [[aerospace]] industries, consumer [[electronics]], [[petrochemical]]s and [[nuclear technology]]. Iran is also hoping to attract billions of dollars worth of [[foreign investment]] by creating a more favorable investment climate, such as reduced restrictions and duties on imports and the creation of free-trade zones like in [[Chabahar]] and the island of [[Kish]]. Modern Iran has a solid [[middle class]] and a growing economy but continues to be plagued with high [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]]. 

Iranian budget deficits have been a chronic problem, in part due to large-scale state subsidies&ndash; totaling some $7.25 billion per year&ndash;including [[foodstuffs]] and especially [[gasoline]].

[[Image:Elahiyeh.jpg|thumb|right|The towering [[Alborz]] mountains in Tehran rising above modern high rises of the [[Elahiyeh]] district.]]

Iran is [[OPEC]]'s second largest oil producer and holds 10% of the world's proven oil reserves. It also has the world's second largest [[natural gas]] reserves (after [[Russia]]). The strong oil market in 1996 helped ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt service payments. 

[[Image:Meydoon sadeghiyeh.jpg|left|thumb|A busy commercial street in Tehran.]]

State investment has boosted [[agriculture]] with the [[liberalization]] of production and the improvement of packaging and marketing helping to develop new export markets. Large-scale [[irrigation]] schemes, together with the wider production of export-based agricultural items such as [[date palm|dates]], [[flower]]s and [[pistachio]]s, produced the fastest economic growth of any sector in Iran over much of the [[1990s]].  Even though a series of [[drought]]s has held back output growth substantially, [[agriculture]] remains one of the largest employers. Iran has also developed a [[biotechnology]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[pharmaceuticals]] industry.

Iran's major commercial partners are [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. Since the late 1990's, Iran has increased its economic cooperation with other developing countries, including [[Syria]], [[India]], [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]] and [[South Africa]]. Iran is also expanding its trade ties with [[Turkey]] and [[Pakistan]] and shares with its partners the common goal for the creation of a single economic market in West and Central [[Asia]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Iran}}

===Ethnic groups===
[[Image:Iran peoples.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ethnic groups in Iran]]

The majority of Iran's [[population]] speak one of the [[Iranian languages]], though [[Persian language|Persian]] is the official language. While the number, percentage, and definition of the different Iranian peoples is disputed, the major [[ethnic]] groups and [[Ethnic minorities in Iran|minorities]] in Iran include the [[Persians]] (51%), [[Azeris]] (24%), [[Gilaki and Mazandarani]] (8%), [[Kurds]] (7%), [[Arabs]] (3%), [[Baluchistan|Baluchi]] (2%), [[Lorestan|Lurs]] (2%), [[Turkmen people]] (2%), [[Qashqai]], [[Armenians]], [[Georgians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]],  [[Circassians]], [[Tats]], and others (1%). These percentages however are only old estimates. There are no official statistics on [[ethnicity]] numbers or percentages in Iran.<ref name="factbook">http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html</ref>. The literacy rate in Iran is above 89% and closer to 100% for its younger population.

Iran's population size increased dramatically during the latter half of the [[20th century]] to reach 70 million in 2006, although in recent years Iran appears to have taken control of its high population growth rate and many studies show that Iran's population growth rate will continue to decline until it will reach replacement level and stabilize by the year 2050 (100 million). Iran's [[population density]] is forty persons per square kilometer. <ref>http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbsum.pl?cty=IR</ref> <ref>http://www.un.org/Depts/escap/pop/journal/v10n1a1.htm</ref> <ref>http://www.payvand.com/news/04/aug/1017.html</ref> Iran hosts more than one million [[foreign]] [[refugee]]s (mainly from [[Afghanistan]] with some from [[Iraq]]), one of the largest figures on [[Earth|earth]], and official government policy and social factors aim towards [[repatriation]]. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3971711.stm</ref> <ref>http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=48323&SelectRegion=Middle_East&SelectCountry=IRAN</ref> <ref>http://countrystudies.us/iran/35.htm</ref>

Inversely, Iran has a [[diaspora]] estimated at over three million people who emigrated to [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[South America]], for the most part occurring after the [[Iranian revolution]].

[[Image:Iran ethnoreligious distribution 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing ethnic and religious diversity among the population of Iran.]]

===Major Languages===
The number of native speakers of Persian language in Iran is estimated around 70 million, (see: [[Persian people]]) ( [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IR Ethnologue] using an obsolete and old information claims that in 1997 there were 22 million native speakers of [[Persian language]] spoken in Iran). Other major languages in Iran are [[Azeri language|Azeri]] (c. 16.8 million), [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] (7.6 million) (Northern, Central, Southern and Laki), [[Gilaki]] (3.265 million), [[Mazandarani]] (3.265 million), [[Luri]] (2.375 million), [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] (2 million), [[Bakhtiari]] (1 million). [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is also spoken in southern Iran. By and large, speakers of these other languages are fluent in Persian as well, as Persian is the lingua franca of the country.

===Religion===
Most Iranians are Muslims; 90% belong to the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] branch of [[Islam]], the official state religion, and about 9% belong to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch (many of whom are Kurds). The remainder consists of non-Muslim [[Religious minorities in Iran|religious minorities]], mainly [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Persian Jews|Jews]] and [[Christians in Iran|Christians]].<ref name="factbook">http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html</ref>

The latter three [[minority]] religions are officially recognized and have reserved seats in the ''[[Majles]]'' (Parliament), and are officially protected religions. In contrast, the Bahá'í Faith, the largest religious minority in Iran, is not officially recognized, and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution has increased with executions and the denial of access to higher education. More recent persecution towards Bahá'ís has led to the United Nations Special Rapporteur of the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] stating on [[March 20]], [[2006]] that "The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating." [http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/5E72D6B7B624AABBC125713700572D09?opendocument] ''See also [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] and [[religious minorities in Iran]] for more information.''

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Iran}}

Iran has a long history of [[art]], [[music]], [[architecture]], [[poetry]], [[philosophy]], [[tradition]]s, and [[ideology]]. Many Iranians believe their culture to be the one and only reason why their civilization has continuously survived thousands of years of turmoil.

[[Image:Mehmooni2.jpg|thumb|right|''Farhang'' ("culture") has always been the [[focal point]] of Iranian civilization. Most Iranians consider themselves the proud [[Cultural heritage|inheritors]] and [[guardian]]s of an ancient and sophisticated culture.]]
که ایران بهشت است یا بوستان<br>
همی بوی مشک آید از دوستان

''"Whether one thinks of Iran as [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] or [[Persian Garden|Garden]],''<br>
''The smell of [[musk]] abounds there from friend and companion."''<br>
--''[[Firdawsi]]''

همه عالم تن است و ایران دل<br>
نیست گوینده زین قیاس خجل

"''Iran is The Heart and all the universe The Body,''<br>
''Of this claim, the poet feels no regret or humility."''<br>
--''[[Nizami]]'' 

[[Persian literature]] is also highly regarded by both native Persians and foreign scholars. The [[Persian language]] being used for over 2,500 years has left distinct marks in the history of the written word. Because of such poets as [[Hafez]], Molavi([[Rumi]]), [[Omar Khayyam]], and [[Ferdowsi]], Iranian poetry has received world-wide attention for their beautiful poems and songs.

With 300 international awards in the past twenty-five years, films from Iran continue to be celebrated worldwide. Perhaps the best known director is [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. All media in Iran are controlled directly or indirectly by the state and must be approved by the [[Ministry of Islamic Guidance]]. This includes the [[Internet]], which has become an expanding means to accessing information and self-expression among the younger population.
