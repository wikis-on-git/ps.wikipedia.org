The '''Republic of Djibouti''' ({{lang-ar|: جيبوتي}}, ''Ǧībūtī'') is a country in [[eastern Africa]], located in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Djibouti is bordered by [[اېتوپيا]] in the north, [[اېتوپيا]] in the west and south, and [[سوماليا]] in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. On the other side of the Red Sea, on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], 20 kilometres (12&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) from the coast of Djibouti, is [[يمن]].

==تاريخ==
''Main article: [[د جېبوتي تاريخ]]''

The area of Djibouti has been occupied by several tribes,  currently the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] and the [[Somali (ethnicity)|Somali]] Issa, Gadaboursi These tribes had regular trade contacts with the Arabs, and adopted [[Islam]] as their religion.

In the [[19th century]], [[France]] established a [[protectorate]] in the area, named '''French Somaliland''', governed by [[Léonce Lagarde]]. In [[1967]], the name was changed to the '''French Territory of the Afars and the Issas'''. On [[June 27]], [[1977]], the country was granted independence as '''Djibouti'''.

A civil war led by Afar rebels in the early [[1990s]] was stopped by a peace accord in [[1994]].

==سياست==
''Main article: [[د جېبوتي سياست]]''

Djibouti is a [[Semi-presidential repubilc|semi-presedential]] [[republic]], with [[executive power]] in the government, and [[legislative power]] in both the government and parliament. The parlimanetary party system is dominated by the [[People's Rally for Progress]] and the current President is [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]]. The country's current constitution was approved in September 1992.

The government is seen as being controlled by the Somali Issas, though at its head power shared between an Somali President and an Afar Prime Minister ([[Dileita Mohamed Dileita]]), with cabinet posts simialrly divided. The country has recently come out of a decade long [[civil war]], with the government and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD) signing a peace treaty in 2001. Two FRUD members are part of the current cabinet.

Despite elctions of the 1990s being described as "generally fair", Guelleh was sworn in for his second and final six year term as president in a one-man race on [[8 April]] [[2005]]. He took 100% of the votes in a 78.9% turnout. Opposition parties boycotted the election, describing the poll as "ridiculous, rigged and rubbish". 

Djibouti's second president, Guelleh was first elected to office in 1999, taking over from his uncle, [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]], who had ruled the country since its independence from France in 1977. {{ref|www.irinnews.org.319}}

The prime minister, who leads the council of ministers ('cabinet') is appointed by the President. The parliament - the ''Chambre des Deputes'' - consists of 65 members who are elected every five years.

[[Image:Djibouti-regions.png|right|150px|Map of the Regions of Djibouti.]]
Djibouti is divided into 5 [[region]]s and one [[city]]. It is further subdivided into 15 [[districts]].

The [[Regions of Djibouti|regions]] include:

* [[Ali Sabieh Region]] (''Region d'Ali Sabieh'')
* [[Arta Region]] (''Region d'Arta'')
* [[Dikhil Region]] (''Region de Dikhil'')
* [[Djibouti (city)]] (''Ville de Djibouti'')
* [[Obock Region]] (''Region d'Obock'')
* [[Tadjourah Region]] (''Region de Tadjourah'')

Districts: see [[Districts of Djibouti]]

==اقتصاد==
''Main article: [[د جېبوتي اقتصاد]]''

The economy of Djibouti is based on service activities connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall limits crop production to [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], and most food must be imported.

Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural resources and little [[industry]]. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An [[unemployment]] rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major problem. [[Inflation]] is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the [[Djiboutian franc|franc]] to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because of [[recession]], [[civil war]], and a high [[population growth rate]] (including immigrants and refugees). Also, renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has disturbed normal external channels of commerce. Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen into arrears on long-term external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.

==Demographics==
{{unreferencedsect}}
''Main article: [[Demographics of Djibouti]]''

The population is divided into two main groups, the Issa , Gadabouri , Isaq make up 60% and the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]], about 35%. The remainder is formed by [[Europe]]ans (mostly [[France|French]] and [[Italy|Italians]]), [[Arab]]s and [[Ethiopia]]ns. The presence of two different population groups was the cause of the civil war in the early [[1990s]].

The Somali ethnic component in Djibouti is mainly composed of the Issas, who form the majority and rule the nation, and the Gadabuursi and Isaaq, all of whom are closely related as [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] subclans. The Issas form part of the Madoobe Dir, while the Gadabuursi and Isaaq are part of the Mahe Dir, Mohammed Hiniftire. Other Somalis in Djibouti include [[Issa]]s from the Ethiopian [[Somali Region]] and from northern Somalia.

Almost all of the people of Djibouti are [[Muslim]], only a small percentage are [[Christianity|Christian]], notably the [[European]]s.

Although [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are the official languages, [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Afar language|Afar]] are widely spoken.
