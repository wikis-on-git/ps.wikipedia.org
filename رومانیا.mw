'''رومانیا''': ([[رومانیایي]]: România {{IPA|/ro.mɨˈni.a/}}) دا په [[سویل ختیزه اروپا|سویل ختیزه]] او [[مرکزي اروپا]] اروپا کې پروت هیواد دی.

Romania borders [[هنګري]] and [[سربيا]] to the west, [[اوکراين]] and [[مولدوا]] to the northeast, and [[بلغاريه/بلغارستان]] to the south.  Romania has a stretch of sea coast along the [[Black Sea]], and the eastern and southern [[Carpathian mountains]] run through its center.
 
Historic [[Bucharest]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Bucureşti'' [[رسنۍ:Ro-Bucureşti.ogg|{{IPA|/bu.kuˈreʃtʲ/}}]]), a major [[tourism|tourist]] attraction, is the country's capital and largest city. Romania has been an activ e member of [[NATO]] since 2004, and is also an acceding country to the [[European Union]]. The EU [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Accession Treaty]] was signed in early 2005, and Romania is due to join the [[European Union]] on [[January 1]], [[2007]]. Starting on [[January 1]], [[2007]], Romania will have the seventh largest population and the ninth largest territory in the [[EU]]. The accession of Romania and Bulgaria, as expected in 2007, will complete the fifth enlargement of the EU that had started in May 2004.

== Name ==
''Main article:  [[Etymology of Romania]]''

The name of ''Romania'' (''[[România]]'') comes from ''Român'' (Romanian) which is a derivative of the word ''Romanus'' ("[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]") from [[Latin]].
The fact of Romanians calling themselves with a derivative of ''Romanus'' (Rom.: Român/Rumân) is scholarly mentioned as late as the 16th century by many authors among whom Italian Humanists travelling in Transylvania, Moldavia and Walachia.
The oldest surviving document written in the [[Romanian language]] is a 1521 letter (known as "[[Neacsu's Letter]] from Câmpulung") which notifies the mayor of [[Braşov]] about the imminent attack of the [[Ottoman Turks]]. This document is also notable for having the first occurrence of "Rumanian" in a Romanian written text, [[Wallachia]] being here named The Rumanian Land - Ţeara Rumânească (Ţeara <!-- Yes, this is Ţeara, not Ţara, it is quoting an old document --> < Latin Terra = land). In the following centuries, Romanian documents use interchangeably two spelling forms: ''Român'' and ''Rumân''. Socio-linguistic evolutions in the late 17th century lead to a process of semantic differentiation: the form ''"rumân"'', presumably usual among lower classes, got the meaning of "bondsman", while the form ''"[[român]]"'' kept an ethno-linguistic meaning. After the abolition of the serfage in 1746, the form "rumân" gradually disappears and the spelling definitively stabilises to the form ''"român", "românesc"''. The name "[[România]]" as common homeland of all Romanians is documented in the early 19th century.
Many Romanians take pride in being the most eastern [[Romance languages|Romance]] people, completely surrounded by non-Latin peoples ("a Latin island in a Slavic sea").

{{History of Romania}}
=== Dacia ===
In 513 BC, south of the [[Danube]], the tribal confederation of the [[Dacia|Getae]] were defeated by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] emperor [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]] during his campaign against the [[Scythians]] (Herodotus IV.93). Over half a millennium later, the Getae (also named ''Daci'' by Romans) were defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] under Emperor [[Trajan]] in two campaigns stretching from 101 to 106, and the core of their kingdom was turned into the [[Roman province]] of [[Dacia]]. The [[Goths|Gothic]] and [[Carpians|Carpic]] campaigns in the [[Balkan]]s during 238–269 (from the beginning of the military anarchy period to the [[battle of Naissus]]) forced the Roman Empire to reorganize a new Roman province of Dacia south of the Danube, inside former [[Moesia]] Superior.

=== Romania in the Middle Ages ===
[[دوتنه:Sibiuphoto.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The medieval city of [[Sibiu]]]]
In 271 or 275 the Roman army and administration left Dacia, which was invaded by the [[Goths]], who lived with the local people until the fourth century, when another nomadic people arrived, the [[Huns]]. The [[Gepids]] and the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] ruled [[Transylvania]] until the 8th century, after which the [[Bulgars]] included the territory of modern Romania to their Empire until 1018. Transylvania was under control of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from the 10-11th century until the 16th century when the independent Principality of Transylvania was formed. But from the destructions and the financial burdens, the local people were not influenced by the migrators in their culture and way of life. The [[Pechenegs]], the [[Cumans]] and [[Uzes]] were also mentioned by historic chronicles on the territory of Romania, until the founding of the [[Romanian]] principalities of [[Wallachia]] by [[Basarab I]], and [[Moldavia]] by [[Dragoş]] during the 13th and 14th centuries respectively. In the [[Middle Ages]], Romanians lived in two distinct independent Romanian principalities: [[Wallachia]] (Rom.:''Ţara Românească - Romanian Land''), [[Moldavia]] (Rom.: ''Moldova'') as well as in the Hungarian-ruled principality of [[Transylvania]].

=== Romania in the Middle Ages ===
In 1475, [[Stephen the Great]] of Moldavia scored a decisive victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the [[Battle of Vaslui]]. Wallachia and Moldavia would later come gradually under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th and 16th centuries (1476 for Wallachia, 1514 for Moldavia), as vassal tributary states with complete internal autonomy and an external independence which was finally lost in the 18th century. In 1812 the [[Russian Empire]] annexed the eastern half side [[Bessarabia]] of Moldavia (though partially regained it with the [[Treaty of Paris]] in 1856), the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] annexed in 1775 its northern part [[Bukovina]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] its  south-eastern part [[Budjak]] .

One of the greatest Hungarian kings, [[Matthias Corvinus]] (known in Romanian as [[Matei Corvin]] - with [[Romanians|romanian]] origin, ruled 1458–1490)— was born in Transylvania, and is claimed by the Romanians because of his Romanian father, [[John Hunyadi|Iancu de Hunedoara]] (Hunyadi János in Hungarian), and by the Hungarians because of his Hungarian mother, (ruled 1458–1490) — was born in Transylvania.  Later, in 1541, [[Transylvania]] became a multi-ethnic principality under the suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following the [[Battle of Mohács]].

=== Early Modern Romania ===
[[Michael the Brave]] (Romanian: Mihai Viteazul) (1558-9 August 1601) was the Prince of Wallachia (1593-1601), of Transylvania (1599-1600), and of Moldavia (1600). During his reign the three principalities largely inhabited by Romanians were for the first time united under a single rule. He is regarded as one of Romania's greatest national heroes.
[[دوتنه:pelescastle.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|[[Peleş Castle]], retreat of Romanian monarchs]]
At the end of the 18th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] incorporated Transylvania into what successively became the [[Austrian Empire]]. During the time of the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] (1867-1918), Romanians in Transylvania experienced one of the worst oppression in the form of the [[Magyarization]] policies of the Hungarian government.

=== Kingdom of Romania ===
The modern state of Romania was formed by the merging of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 under the Moldavian [[domnitor]] [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. He was replaced by Prince Karl of [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] in 1866. During the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]], Romania fought on the Russian side; in the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878 Romania was recognized as an independent state by the Great Powers. In return for ceding to Russia the three southern districts of [[Bessarabia]] which had been regained by Moldavia after the [[Crimean War]] in 1852, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] acquired [[Dobruja]]. In 1881 the [[principality]] was raised to a [[monarchy|kingdom]] and Prince Carol I became [[Monarch|King]] [[Carol I]].

[[دوتنه:Brasov0144.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|290px|[[Braşov]]]]

Romania entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Triple Entente]]. The [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian military campaign]] ended in disaster for Romania as the [[Central Powers]] conquered most of the country and captured or killed the majority of its army within four months. By war's end Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire had collapsed, allowing Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania to unite with the Kingdom of Romania in 1918. Restored [[Hungary]] renounced in favour of Romania to any claims over the rights and titles of [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920.

=== Romania during World War II ===
In 1940 during [[World War II]], [[Northern Bukovina]] and Bessarabia, [[Northern Transylvania]], and southern [[Dobrudja]] were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], Hungary and Bulgaria respectively (see [[Romania during World War II]]). The authoritarian [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] abdicated in 1940 and the subsequent year Romania entered the war joining [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Hungary]] and [[Bulgaria]]. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], Romania recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina from the Soviet Russia, under the leadership of general [[Ion Antonescu]]. It was awarded the territory Transnistria by Germany. During the Second World War, the Antonescu regime, allied with Nazi Germany, played a role in the [[Holocaust]], following its policy of oppression and massacre of the [[Jews]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Roma people|Romas]].  According to a quite controversial report released in 2004 by a commission appointed by former Romanian president [[Ion Iliescu]] and chaired by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Elie Wiesel]], the Romanian authorities were the main perpetrators in the planning and implementation of the killing of between 280,000 to 380,000 Jews, primarily in the Eastern territories Romania recovered or occupied from the Soviet Union and in [[Moldavia]]{{fact}}, though some estimates are even higher.

In August 1944 the Antonescu regime was toppled, and Romania joined the [[Red Army]] against [[Nazi Germany]], but its role in the defeat of Germany was not recognized by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1947.

=== Communist Romania ===
With the [[Red Army]] forces still stationed in the country and exerting defacto control, [[communism|communists]] and their allied parties claimed 80% of the vote in the 1946 Romanian elections, through a combination of vote manipulation, elimination and forced mergers of competing parties, establishing themselves as the dominant force; Western democracies left Romania in the hands of the [[Soviet Union]]. In [[1947]], [[Michael I of Romania|King Michael I]] was forced by the communists to abdicate and leave the country.

Romania was proclaimed a [[communist state]], under direct military and economic control of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] until 1958. During this period, Romania's scarce resources left after WWII were drained by the "[[SovRom]]" agreements: mixed Soviet-Romanian companies established in the aftermath of World War II to mask the looting of Romania by the Soviet Union, in addition to excessive war reparations paid to the USSR. During this period, up to two million people were arbitrarily imprisoned for political, economical or unknown reasons. There were hundreds of thousands of abuses, deaths and incidents of torture against a large range of people, from political opponents to ordinary citizens, bringing gloom over Romania. At least 200,000 people lost their lives as a result of communist influences in Romania between 1948 and 1964.

A short-lived period of relative economic well-being and openness followed in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, still regarded by some as a "[[golden era]]". This period gradually ended, first politically, and then economically. Some party leaders (such as [[Ion Iliescu]], [[Corneliu Manescu]], or [[Gheorghe Apostol]]) who questioned the achievements of the regime during the latter portion of this era, were sent to lower positions. From an economic point of view, Romania's foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from 3 to 10 billion US dollars). Thus, the influence of international financial organisms such as the [[IMF]] or the [[World Bank]] grew, conflicting with [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s [[autarky|autarchic]] policies. Ceauşescu eventually initiated a project of total reimbursement of the foreign debt (completed in 1989, shortly before his overthrow). To achieve this goal, he imposed policies that impoverished Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy. He profoundly deepened Romania's police state (see [[Securitate]]) and imposed a [[cult of personality]].

One positive achievement during that period was the spread of near-universal [[literacy]] and the development of a very efficient education system. However, this educational transformation was not coupled with appropriate industrial development and urbanization policies, so that almost half of Romania's population is still rural (47.3%; see [[Demography of Romania]]).
Another achievement is the negotiated retreat of Soviet troops from Romania, in 1958. This allowed the country to pursue independent policies, including the condemnation by the Communist Party of Romania of the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] (Romania was the only country of the Warsaw pact not to take part in the invasion), the continuation of Romanian-[[Israel]]i diplomatic relations after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 (Romania was the only country in the Warsaw pact to do so), the establishment of economic (1963) and diplomatic (1967) relations with the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], and so forth.
Close ties between Romania and both Israel and the [[Arab]] countries (and the [[PLO]]) allowed Romania to play an essential role in the [[Israel]]-[[Egypt]] and Israel-PLO peace processes.



The Communist dictatorship ended [[22 December]] 1989 (see [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]).
During the 1989 revolution, power was taken by a group called the [[National Salvation Front]] (FSN), which grouped a large number of former members of the communist party and of the Securitate (Romanian equivalent to [[KGB]]), the two were then linked but also a small number of dissidents, other personalities and (then-unknown) persons that participated in the uprising which genuinely thought the FSN to be an anti-communist movement. The FSN assumed the missions of restoring civil order (which it did) and immediately took seemingly democratic measures.

Despite the desperate efforts of the Securitate to hide the fact that the FSN was in fact just a new name for the same ex-communists, public opinion regarded it as being the new name of Communist Party. Thus Romanians assisted to the resurrection of the traditional parties which were the main parties in Romania before World War 2 and that had been illegalized. These traditional parties are the National Christian Democrat Peasant's Party (PNTCD), the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Romanian Social Democrat Party (PSDR), all of whom were led by non communists and former political prisoners. These parties rallied a great amount of public support in a very short time despite the fact that all of the Romanian media was controlled by the FSN and the directed efforts of the Securitate to discredit its leaders. Their rapidly rising popularity raised concern among FSN leaders who feared losing power and thus having to answer for the crimes committed during the Ceausescu regime. This concern is what prompted the president of the FSN, Ion Iliescu, to call on the coal miners of the Jiu Valley to come to Bucharest to "re-establish public order which had been disturbed by vandals". The vandals, who were in fact supporters of the genuine anti-communist parties which had rallied in order not to see the country fall in the hands of those it was trying to flee. The joint anti-communist movement (composed of the three traditional Romanian parties) was halted and so was Romania's path towards true freedom and genuine democracy in the early 1990s.

Through the clever use of the Securiate's notorious disinformation skills, its network of informants and agents among Romanians and the brute force of the coal miners, Romania's ex-communists managed to stay in power after the revolution. They won the undemocratic elections (the opposition's head quarters had been vandalized and its members severely beaten by miners, the entire media was controlled by the FSN, furthermore large denigration campaigns against opposition leaders were being pursued by the Securitate) they had organised. Since then their names have been seen linked to most of the corruption scandals which plagued Romania.

=== Romania since 1989 ===
Following the end of the Cold War in 1989, Romania developed closer ties with Western Europe, the country quickly applied for membership in the EU in June 1993, becoming in 1995 Associated State of EU, joined [[NATO]] in 2004 and became an Acceding Country to the [[European Union]], being at an advanced stage to join on [[January 1]], [[2007]]. The [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Treaty of Accession]] of Romania has been signed by EU member states' representatives in Luxembourg, Abbaye de Neumünster, on [[April 25]] [[2005]]. Ratification of the Romanian and [[Bulgaria]]n Accession Treaty is ongoing in the parliaments of all member states.

The subsequent disintegration of the FSN, which did not have a clear political platform (given the fact that the only thing that united them was their greed for power and fear of being prosecuted), produced several political parties including the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), which for a time retained the FSN name), the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD, formerly known as the [[Romanian Democrat Social Party]] (PDSR) or the [[Democratic National Salvation Front]]-FDSN), and the [[Alliance for Romania]] (APR). Throughout several elections, coalitions, and governments, parties that emerged from the [[National Salvation Front|FSN]] governed or participated in the government of Romania from 1990 until today.

In 1996, the CDR entered power on a "[[Contract with Romania]]" platform which would have required the CDR to resign en masse after 200 days from a mixed coalition government. Some members had signed on to the contract programme, while others had not; once in power, the "Contract" was repudiated. The major CDR parties were electorally eviscerated in 2000, and the Social Democrats returned to power, with [[Ion Iliescu]] once again president of Romania and [[Adrian Năstase]], the president of the Social-Democratic Party (PSD), as prime minister.

[[دوتنه:Ateneul Roman b.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Romanian Athenaeum]]]]

On [[December 12]], [[2004]], [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected president of Romania, with campaign promises to stop corruption by bringing the corrupt to justice and by unmasking all former Securitate members. He was supported during elections by a coalition, called Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), formed of his [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] and of the [[National-Liberal Party]]. The government was formed by a larger coalition which also included the [[Romanian Humanist Party]] (now called [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]]) and the ethnic Hungarian party [[UDMR]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Romania}}

The legislative branch of the Romanian government consists of two chambers, ''Senatul'' (The [[Senate]]), which has 137 members (as of 2004), and ''Camera Deputaţilor'' (The [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]]), which has 332 members (as of 2004). The members of both chambers are elected every four years.

The [[Presidents of Romania|President]] is also elected by popular vote, every five years (until 2004, four years).
[[دوتنه:Casa_poporului.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Casa Poporului]], the Romanian Parliament ([[:Image:Lamppost bgiu.jpg|Closeup]] of the lights in front)]]

The President appoints the [[Prime ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]], who heads the Government, and the members of the Government, who are chosen by the Prime Minister. In fact the Prime Minister is a member of the party or of the coalition that holds the majority in The Parliament. The President can choose the Prime minister only if none of the parties hold 50% + 1 of the total number of the members of the Parliament. The Government is subject to a parliamentary vote of approval.

The judicial power belongs to a hierarchical system of courts culminating with the supreme court-''Înalta Curte de Justiţie şi Casaţie'' (The High Court of Justice and Casation). The Romanian judicial system is an [[inquisitorial system]], of strong French influence.

The ''Curtea Constituţională'' (The Constitutional Court) judges the exceptions of non-constitutionality when invoked in any judicial court and judges the compliance of laws or other state regulations to the [[Romanian Constitution]] , if these are brought before it. It follows the tradition of the [[Constitutional Council of France|French Constitutional Council]] in requiring 9 judges to hold a 9 year, non-renewable term. Following the 2003 revision of the Constitution, its decisions cannot be defeated by any majority of the Parliament.

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Ro-map.png|thumb|Map of Romania]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Romania]]''

A large part of Romania's borders with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]] is formed by the [[Danube]]. The [[Danube]] is joined by the [[Prut River]], which forms the border with [[Moldova]]. The Danube flows into the [[Black Sea]] forming the [[Danube Delta]] which is a reservation of the Biosphere. Romania's fauna and flora are varied. It is one of the few European countries to have [[Brown Bear]]s within its territory. [[Chamois]] are known to live in the [[Carpathian]] mountains. The country's most significant rivers are the [[Danube]], which marks part of the border between Romania and Bulgaria, the [[Siret River|Siret]], running vertically through [[Moldavia]], the [[Olt River|Olt]], running from the oriental Carpathian Mountains to [[Oltenia]], the [[Tisa]], marking a part of the border between Romania and Hungary, and the [[Someş]].
<!--[[Image:CarpathiansRO.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Carpathian Mountains]] in Romania, an important tourist destination in [[Europe]] ]]-->

Because many of Romania's borders are defined by natural, sometimes shifting rivers, and because the [[Danube Delta]] is constantly expanding towards the sea, about 2-5 linear metres (6–16&nbsp;ft) yearly, Romania's surface area has changed over the past few decades, generally increasing. The number has increased from about 237,500 square kilometres (91,699&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) in 1969 to 238,391 square kilometres (92,043&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in 2005.{{citation needed}}

Romania's terrain is distributed roughly equally among between mountainous, hilly and lowland territories.

The [[Carpathian Mountains]] dominate the centre of Romania surrounding the Transylvanian Plateau, 14 peaks reaching above the altitude of 2,000 metres (6,560&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), the highest being ''[[Moldoveanu Peak]]''. In the south, the Carpathians sweeten into hills, towards the [[Bărăgan Plain]]s.

The three highest mountains in Romania are:

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Romania]]''

[[دوتنه:100_1807.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The World Trade Center in [[Bucharest]]]]

After Romania's [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|overthrown]] in late 1989, the country experienced a decade of economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base as well as a lack of structural reform. Starting from 2000, however, the economy was transformed into one of relative macreconomic stability, high growth, low unemployment and increasing foreign investment, and is currently among the most developed in [[Southeastern Europe]].
Economic growth since 2000 has averaged 4-5%, rising to 8.3% in 2004. This has characterised Romania as a [[Economic boom|boom economy]] and one of the fastest growing in Europe. Romania was granted in October 2004 the much desired 'functional [[market economy]]' status by EU officials, and is expected to join the EU in January 2007. Romania's per-capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], calculated by [[purchasing power parity]] is estimated to be $9,446 in 2006. The national budget is [[Euro|€]]38.1 billion euro (for year 2006), which represents 33.1% of GDP, estimated to be [[Romanian leu|RON]] 322.5 billion ([[Euro|€]]90,8 billions) according to the Prime-Minister [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu|Tăriceanu]].
 
Strong aspects of Romania are the technologically advanced market economy with substantial government participation. Having its own natural resources, Romania has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Romania is largely self-sufficient in food production. Clothing and textiles, industrial machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, metallurgic products, raw materials, cars, military equipment, software, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, and flowers) are leading exports. Romania possesses extensive facilities for oil refining and semiconductor fabrication.

Inflation in 2005 dropped to 7.5%. It is expected to fall further to 5.8% at the end of 2006, and 3.8% for 2007. Unemployment in Romania is at 6.2% (May 2006)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reporter.gr/fulltext_eng.cfm?id=60510154633|title=Romania: Unemployment at 6.2% in March '06 (5.3% in August 2006) |publisher= Premium S.A.|accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>
, which is very low compared to other large European countries such as [[Poland]], [[France]], or [[Germany]].

Since the late 1990s, there have been several economic reforms, spurred on by the country's bid to join the EU, including the liquidation of large energy-intensive industries and major reforms in the agricultural and financial sectors. As of 2005, a significant amount of Romania's major companies have been privatised, including the majority of banks, the largest oil companies [[Petrom]] and [[Rompetrol]], energy distributors and telecommunications companies. The country continues to privatise remaining state enterprises, including [[Poşta Română|Romanian Post]] and the [[Romanian Commercial Bank]]. In comparison to its neighbours, Romania has a high number of small to medium sized enterprises ([[SME]]es). Foreign investment has increased significantly since 2003, reaching [[Euro|€]] 5.1 billion in 2004. ERSTE BANK A.G. will be the new majority shareholder of [[Romanian Commercial Bank]] following the acquisition of a 61.88 percent stake at a price of Euro 7.65 per share, resulting in a total price for the 490,399,321 shares sold of Euro 3,751,554,805 (3.75 Billion €). This is considered the biggest Austrian foreign investment abroad. This is also considered the biggest FDI in Romania. Total FDI in Romania for 2005 was 6.3 Billion €. In the top of investor's country, Austria is leading with more than 6,7 Billion € from 1990 until 2005. For 2006 officials expect foreign direct investments of 10 Billion €.

Romania's economy grew 4.1% in 2005, less than half the growth of the previous year, according to the National Statistics Office. The construction sector increased by 9.9% while the service sector showed an increase of 8.1%<ref>[http://www.insse.ro/statistici/comunicate/lunar_indicatori/a06/sic01r06.pdf Monthly Statistical Indicators, January 2006], National Institute of Statistics</ref>. Currently GDP growth is forecast at 5.9% per annum. Romania's economy is characterized by a huge potential of [[Tourism in Romania|tourism]]. [[Tourism in Romania|Tourism]] of Romania has attracted 
880 millions € investments in 2005 and doubled the amount of money invested in Romanian resorts. <ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/2005-12-29/social/turismul Turismul a atras în 2005 investiţii de 400 milioane de euro], ''[[Gândul]]'', January 11, 2006</ref>

Despite Romania's rapid economic development, poverty is still a pervasive problem, and modernization's effects are only slowly being felt in the country's rural areas. Entrance to the European Union, however, should further speed up the country's development. 

=== Trade ===
The majority of Romania's trade is oriented towards the countries of the [[European Union]]. For the first 3 months of 2006, Romania's [[exports]] rose 24.8%, while [[imports]] rose 31%, in part due to a rise in real wages. In March 2006, Romanian exports grew to a record value of €3.5 billion/month. The trade deficit was about €1.2 billion (US$1.8 billion) in the first three months of the year, well within the target for 2006. In present, at a series of economical indicators, Romania has a similar situation of the new member states of EU, the export of highly technological products being of 4.5% from total exports, comparatively higher than [[Poland]] which has only 2.7% from exports. In December 2005 the [[National Strategy for Export]] for 2005-2009 was adopted. Foreign trade is estimated to top 79 Billion € for 2006, compared with 58 Billion € in 2005.

=== Taxation ===
In January 2005, Romania's new [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu|Tăriceanu]] government imposed major fiscal reforms, replacing Romania's progressive tax system with a 16% [[flat tax]] on both personal income and company profit. Romania now has one of the most [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] taxation systems in Europe, and it is expected that this, along with increased foreign investment, will boost economic growth in the coming years, as well as lower corruption and bring to light the [[grey economy]]. The tax cuts have led a 12 percent jump in household consumption, which was also boosted by a 15 percent rise in wages.

=== Debt ===
Romania's level of international debt is estimated at $24.59 billion in 2004, or 23.6% of GDP which is considered very low. However, as Romania is currently going through an economic boom and is undertaking several major infrastructure projects, especially in the context of its EU accession, debt is expected to rise in absolute terms.

During the latter part of the Ceauşescu period, Romania earned significant credits from several Arab countries, notably [[Iraq]], for work related to the oil industry. In August 2005, Romania forgave US$2 billion of the US$2.5 billion debt owed it by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the U.S.-led "[[Coalition of the Willing]]", making Romania the first country outside of the [[Paris Club]] of wealthy creditor nations to forgive Iraqi debts. Romania has the largest international reserves in the region, estimated at [[Euro|€]] 25 billion (by April 2006), covering more than 7 months of imports.

=== Wages ===
The average gross wage per month in Romania is 1217 new lei [[As of 2006|as of March 2006]], an increase of 25,6% over the previous year. This equates to €456.38, based on international exchange rates; the [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) would be about €930. The average net salary per month in March 2006 was 983 new lei (€319.55, about €712 PPP). The [[Comisia Nationala de Prognoza (CNP)]] calculates that the average gross wage per month will reach €534 (€962 PPP) in 2007 and €623 (1121€ PPP) in 2009.

=== Currency ===
[[دوتنه:Bgiusca Banca Nationala a Romaniei.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The National Bank of Romania]]

Romania's legal tender is the [[Romanian leu|leu]] (plural ''lei''). On [[1 July]] [[2005]], the leu was subjected to revaluation so that 10,000 old lei, in circulation on that date, was exchanged for 1 new leu ([[Romanian leu|RON]]). The existing banknotes and coins, i.e. the old lei, will be legal tender until the end of December 2006. The official exchange rate for [[4 August]] [[2006]] for 1€=3.53 lei ([[National Bank of Romania]]). By [[31 December]] [[2006]], the existing banknotes and coins, i.e. the old lei, are to be replaced gradually by the new banknotes and coins. The process will prepare Romania for the adoption of the euro, which is expected to take place several years after EU accession. The Romanian government has said that it expects the country will adopt the euro between 2011 and 2012.

'''Main indicators of Romania's economy:'''

Romania's GDP over 2005-2007 will go up by 10 billion euros per year, and will stand in 2007 at 96.138 billion euros.

=== National Budget ===
National budget, about [[€]]35 billion, represents about 31,2% of GDP of [[Romanian leu|RON]] 389,5 billion (EURO 94,8 billion), declared the Prime-Minister Tariceanu, 1 Euro=3,4 RON. National budget is increasing rapidly at about 6 billion EURO each year between 2005-2009. About 2 billion EURO/year are spend on national defense.

Romania's development in the period from 2007-2013 will cost 58,7 billion euros of which 43% represents European Union financial contribution.

== National Holidays ==
The [[Christianity|Christian]] holidays of [[Christmas]] and (Orthodox) [[Easter]] are celebrated (they are official, non-working, holidays). Unlike some other [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Churches, the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] celebrates Christmas on [[25 December]]; however, they follow the usual Eastern Orthodox practice for the date of Easter. Other official holidays (non-working) are [[New Year's Day]] ([[January 1]]), [[Labour Day]] ([[May 1]]), and the National Day of Romania ([[December 1]], the [[Union Day (Romania)|Union Day]]). For [[Christmas]] and for Labour Day, it is common for businesses to shut down more than a single day.

Minor, but widely observed, holidays include [[Mărţişor]] ([[March 1]]), marking the start of spring, and [[International Women's Day]] ([[March 8]]). Many businesses give women employees the day off for International Women's Day. Some holidays celebrated in the [[United States]] or in other parts of Europe have recently been gaining some currency in Romania, for example [[Valentine's Day]] ([[February 14]]).

== Tourism ==
''Main article: [[Tourism in Romania]]''
[[دوتنه:Hunedoara-castle-side.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hunyad Castle]], [[Hunedoara]] ]]
Romanian tourism focuses on the country's natural landscapes and its history, from [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] to hot [[Black Sea]] shores and the heights of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].

[[دوتنه:Bierţan castle.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Biertan|Bierţan Castle]], part of [[UNESCO World Heritage]] ]]

Annually, more than 7 million tourists from all over the world, most of them from [[Western Europe]] and [[United States]], spend their holiday in Romania.  Many of the major touristic sites are part of [[World Heritage Sites]].

In the last years there were many new [[romanian national parks]] created parks which also attract visitors.

== Sports in Romania ==
Romania is internationally successful in a number of sports. See [[List of prominent Romanians#Sports|List of Romanians (sport section)]].

The gymnast [[Nadia Comaneci]] was the first gymnast to score a perfect "ten" in the [[1976]] [[Montreal]] Olympics. She also won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze - all at the age of fifteen. Her success continued in the [[1980]] [[Moscow]] Olympics when she was awarded two gold medals and two silver medals.

[[Ilie Năstase]], the tennis player, is another internationally known Romanian sports star. He won several Grand Slam titles and dozens of other tournaments; he also was a successful doubles player. Romania has also reached the [[Davis Cup]] finals three times.

Football (soccer) is popular in Romania with international football players such as [[Adrian Mutu]] who played for [[Chelsea FC]] and is currently captain of [[Romania national football team|the national team]], as well as [[Gheorghe Hagi]] who played for [[Steaua Bucuresti]] (Romania), [[Real Madrid]], [[FC Barcelona]] (Spain) and [[Galatasaray]] (Turkey) among others. The Romanian soccer club [[Steaua Bucuresti|Steaua Bucureşti]] was the first Eastern European club to ever win the prestigious [[European Champions Cup]] title (1986).

[[Rugby union]] is also traditional. (See [[Romania national rugby union team]]).

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Romania]]''
=== Ethnicity ===
Ethnic groups [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ro.html#People (Census 2002)]:

[[Romanians]] 89.5% , [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] 6.6%, [[Roma (people)|Roma]] 2.5%, [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] 0.3%, [[Germans|German]], 0.3%, [[Russians|Russian]] 0.2%, [[Turkish people|Turkish]] 0.2%, [[Serbians|Serbian]] 0.1%, [[Slovak]] 0.1%, Other 0.2%.

[[دوتنه:Map Roumanophone World.png|thumb|right|250px|'''Roumanophone World''']]
Other ethnic groups include natives of Romania's neighbouring countries and some smaller groups like the [[Polish minority in Romania|Polish minority]] (numbering a few thousand people) living in [[Suceava (county)|Suceava County]].

According to law, ethnic minorities can use their native language in education. Ethnic minorities are offered native language access to public administration in towns and villages where they make up for more than 20% of the population. In towns and villages where they make up for more than 30% of the population, local council meetings can be held in the minority language, provided that translation into Romanian is provided, and that official minutes are kept in Romanian (cf. the Public Administration Law, link below).

On the other hand, some members and observers of minor ethnic minorities (e.g.) [[Roma people|Roma]] claim that their numbers are undercounted in national censuses [http://www.per-usa.org/reports/PERStrasbourg.pdf], 
[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18387.htm], [http://www.uur.itcnet.ro/history02_eng.htm#demography_real].

=== Language ===
The official language is [[Romanian language|Romanian]], a [[Romance language]] of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] subfamily of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. This language family includes French, Spanish, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], Italian and Portuguese; its languages are spoken by about 670 million people in many parts of the world, but mainly in Europe and the Western Hemisphere. About 24 million people worldwide speak Romanian, mostly in Romania and Moldova.

A sizeable [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarian]] minority in Transylvania speaks [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as well as Romanian; until the 1990s, there were also a substantial number of [[German language|German]]-speaking [[Transylvanian Saxons]], but in exchange for payments to the Communist regime many left to West Germany and most of the remainder have left the country since the fall of communism and the accompanying opening of borders.

The Romanian educational system puts a strong emphasis on foreign languages, and [[Radio România Internaţional]] broadcasts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (broadcasts in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ended in late March 2004). 

According to the Eurobarometer Report "Europeans and Languages" (Sept. 2005) more than a quarter of Romanians understand and speak [[English language|English]] and 17% [[French language|French]]. Romania is a member of the [[Organisation de la Francophonie]], with Bucharest being the host of the [[Summit of Francophony]] in 2006.

In terms of foreign languages, 5 million Romanians speak [[English language|English]], 4-5 million speak [[French language|French]], 1.5 million speak [[German language|German]], 2 million speak [[Italian language|Italian]], and 1 million speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [http://www.anis.ro/index.php?page=afaceri&sec=afaceri_avantaje&lang=ro]

Historically, French was the leading foreign language for Romanians to study; now it is English, so that, as a group, Romanian English-speakers are generally younger than Romanian French-speakers.

=== Religion ===
Religions (2002 Census):

* [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] - 86.8% (See: [[Orthodoxism in Romania]])
* [[Roman Catholic]] - 4.5%
* [[Protestant]] - 3.7%
* [[Pentecostal]] - 1.5%
* [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Uniate Church|Greek-Catholic Uniate]] - 0.9%
[[دوتنه:MoldovitaIV.jpg|thumb|right|Moldoviţa Monastery in Bukovina, Northern Moldavia]]
Most Romanians are members of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], which is one of the churches of [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. [[Catholicism]] (both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Romanian Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]]) and [[Protestantism]] are also represented.

In [[Dobrogea]], the region lying on the shore of the Black Sea, there is a small [[Muslim]] minority (of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Crimean Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity), which is a remnant of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and migrations from [[Crimea]], respectively (see: [[Islam in Romania]]).

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Romania]]''

Romanian culture is diverse. 

Romanians are very proud of their inventions and discoveries. These include the [[Coanda Effect]] ([[Henri Coanda]] is the parent of the modern [[jet aircraft]]) and [[insulin]] (discovered by [[Nicolae Paulescu]]).

Romanian literature has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Romania (mostly through translations into German, French and English). Some modern Romanian authors became increasingly popular in Germany, France and Italy especially [[Eugen Ionescu]], [[Mircea Eliade]] and [[Mircea Cartarescu]].

The older classics of Romanian literature and Romanian poetry remained very known outside Romania. Traditionally Romanians appreciate poetry more than Romanian prose. [[Mihai Eminescu]], a famous 19th century Romanian poet is still very much loved in Romania (especially his collection of [[Poems]]), among several other "true classics" like [[George Coşbuc]]. [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|The revolutionary year 1848]] had its echoes in the Romanian principalities and in Transylvania, and a new elite from the middle of the 19th century emerged from the revolutions: [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] (writer, politician and the first prime minister of Romania), [[Vasile Alecsandri]] (politician, playwright and poet), [[Andrei Mureşanu]] (publicist and the writer of the current [[Deşteaptă-te, române!|Romanian National Anthem]]) and [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] (historian, writer and revolutionary).

The works of [[George Enescu]] are well-known to Romanians, many of whom consider him their national musician. The symphony orchestra of [[Bucharest]] is named in Enescu's honor.
