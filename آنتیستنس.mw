(مهدی پدرام)
آنتیستنس پایه گذار فلسفه کلبی در سال 444 پیش از میلاد در آتن به دنیا آمد . در جوانی پس از موفقیت در نظامیگری تحت نظر گورگیاس سوفیست آموزش دید . بعد از مدتی آموزشهای گورگیاس به نظرش بیهوده آمد , از این رو مجذوب سقراط و به ویژه سادگی و قناعت او گشت .
او در جلسات سقراط با چهره ای ژولیده و لباسهایی مندرس ظاهر می شد . نقل شده که سقراط به او گفته است : چرا اینقدر تظاهر ! من غرور تو را از سوراخهای لباس مندرست می بینم . آنتیستنس بعد از مرگ سقراط مدرسه اش را در سال 399 پیش از میلاد تاسیس کرد . محلی که او برای مدرسه اش انتخاب کرده بود در نزدیکی ورزشگاهی به نام سیناسارگس (Cynosarges) به معنای سگ سفید قرار داشت یکی از دلایلی که فلسفه او فلسفه کلبی نامیده می شود همین موضوع است . بیشتر کسانی  که جذب این مدرسه می شدند افراد فقیر وتهی دست بودند.

آنتیستنس ردا و خرقه ای خشن می پوشید و  همواره با خود کیفی برای نگهداری وسایلش حمل می کرد . این نوع لباس پوشیدن او به آرامی تبدیل به لباس رسمی کلبیون گشت .

مانند سقراط , آنتیستنس هم فضیلت را برای رسیدن به سعادت و خوشبختی ضروری و در گامی پیشتر کافی می دانست . به اعتقاد او این فضیلت هم شاخه ای از دانش است که با آموزش دست نیافتنی است . او با توجه به گرایشات مذهبی اش فضیلت را دوری از خواهش های شیطان ( لذت و هوی و هوس) میدانست . او بر اساس همین دیدگاه مذهبی جهان را نیز تحت کنترل هوشی خدایی می دانست .



==ژوند==
Antisthenes was born c. 445 BC and was the son of Antisthenes, an [[Athenian]].  His mother was a [[Thracian]].<ref>Suda, ''Antisthenes''.; Diogenes Laërtius, vi.</ref> In his youth he fought at [[Battle of Tanagra (426 BC)|Tanagra]] ([[426 BC]]), and was a disciple first of [[Gorgias]], and then of [[Socrates]], whom he never quitted, and at whose death he was present.<ref>Plato, ''Phaedo'', 59 b.</ref> He never forgave his master's persecutors, and is even said to have been instrumental in procuring their punishment.<ref name="diog1">Diogenes Laërtius, vi.</ref> He survived the [[Battle of Leuctra]] ([[371 BC]]), as he is reported to have compared the victory of the Thebans to a set of schoolboys beating their master.<ref>Plutarch, ''Lycurgus'', 30.</ref> He was apparently still alive in [[366 BC]],<ref>Diodorus Siculus, xv.</ref> and died at Athens c. [[365 BC]], at the age of 70.<ref>Eudocia, ''Violarium''.</ref> He is said to have lectured in the [[Cynosarges]], a gymnasium for the use of Athenians born of foreign mothers, near the temple of [[Herakles|Hercules]].  [[Diogenes Laërtius]] says that his works filled ten volumes, but of these, only fragments remain. His favourite style seems to have been dialogues, some of them being vehement attacks on his contemporaries, as on [[Alcibiades]] in the second of his two works entitled ''Cyrus'', on [[Gorgias]] in his ''Archelaus'' and on [[Plato]] in his ''Satho''.<ref>Athenaeus, v.</ref> His style was pure and elegant, and [[Theopompus]] even said that Plato stole from him many of his thoughts.<ref>Athenaeus, xi.</ref> [[Cicero]], however, calls him "a man more intelligent than learned" ({{lang-la|homo acutus magis quam eruditus}}).<ref>Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Atticum'', xii. 38.</ref> He possessed considerable powers of wit and sarcasm, and was fond of playing upon words; saying, for instance, that he would rather fall among crows (''korakes'') than flatterers (''kolakes''), for the one devour the dead, but the other the living. Two declamations of his are preserved, named ''Ajax'' and ''Ulysses'', which are purely rhetorical.

==د آنتیستنس فلسفي نظريات==

===اخلاق===
Antisthenes was a pupil of Socrates, from whom he imbibed the fundamental ethical precept that [[virtue]], not [[pleasure]], is the end of existence.  In all that the wise man does, Antisthenes said, he conforms to perfect virtue, and pleasure is not only unnecessary to man, but a positive evil. He is reported to have held pain and even ill-repute ({{lang-el|ἀδοξία}}) to be blessings, and that madness is preferable to pleasure. It is, however, probable that he did not consider all pleasure worthless, but only that which results from the gratification of sensual or artificial desires, for we find him praising the pleasures which spring "from out of one's soul",<ref>Xenophon, ''Symposium'', iv, 41.</ref> and the enjoyments of a wisely chosen friendship.<ref name="diog1"/> The supreme good he placed in a life lived according to [[virtue]], - virtue consisting in action, which when obtained is never lost, and exempts the wise man from error. It is closely connected with reason, but to enable it to develop itself in action, and to be sufficient for happiness, it requires the aid of ''Socratic strength'' ({{lang-el|Σωκρατικὴ ἱσχύς}}).<ref name="diog1"/>

===له طبيعت څخه وراخوا نظريه===
The [[Physics]] of Antisthenes contained a theory of the nature of the [[gods]],<ref>Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 13.</ref> in which he contended for the Unity of the Deity, and that man is unable to know him by any sensible representation, since he is unlike any being on earth.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', v.</ref>

===منطق===
In [[logic]], Antisthenes was troubled by the problem of [[the One and the Many]]. As a proper [[nominalist]], he held that definition and predication are either false or [[tautological]], since we can only say that every individual is what it is, and can give no more than a description of its qualities, e. g. that silver is like tin in colour.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', viii. 3.</ref> Thus he disbelieved the Platonic system of Ideas which do not exist save for the consciousness which thinks them. "A horse", said Antisthenes, "I can see, but horsehood I cannot see." Definition is merely a circuitous method of stating an identity: "a tree is a vegetable growth" is logically no more than "a tree is a tree."

==آنتیستنس او كلبيان==
In later times, Antisthenes became to be seen as the founder of the [[Cynics]], but it is by no means certain that he would have understood or recognized the term. [[Aristotle]], writing a generation later refers several times to Antisthenes (and his followers "the Antistheneans") but never associates him with Cynics, nor with Aristotle's contemporary [[Diogenes of Sinope]]. There are many later tales about Diogenes dogging Antisthenes footsteps and becoming his faithful hound, but it is not certain whether the two men ever actually met.  Even the story about Antisthenes lecturing in the Cynosarges gymnasium may be a later desire to link him with a place associated with Cynic philosophy, although as the son of a foreign-born mother, Antisthenes would probably have frequented the place. It is true, however, that Antisthenes adopted a rigorous [[ascetic]] lifestyle,<ref>Xenophon, ''Symposium'', 4.34-44.</ref> and he certainly developed many of the principles of Cynic philosophy which became an inspiration for Diogenes and many later Cynics.
