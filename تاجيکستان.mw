د '''تاجکستان جمهوريت''' ([[تاجکي ژبه|تاجکي]]: {{unicode|ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон}}, ''جمهوري تاجکستان'') په [[منځنۍ آسيا]] کې يو هېواد دی چې په غرونو کې کلابند دی. دا هېواد په سهېل کې د [[قرغزستان]] سره, په سوېل کې د [[افغانستان]] سره، په لوېديځه خوا د [[ازبکستان]] سره او په ختيځه خوا کې د [[چين]] سره ګډې پولې لري. 
  
It is home to the [[Tajiks]], who share culture and history with the Iranians, and speak [[Tajik language|Tajik]], a language closely related to Persian.  Once the location of the famous [[Samanid|Samanid Empire]], Tajikistan became a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century, known as the [[Tajik SSR|Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]].

After independence, however, Tajikistan suffered from a devestating [[Tajikistan Civil War|civil war]] which lasted from [[1992]] to [[1997]].  Since the end of the war, newly-established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country's economy to grow, so much so that it now surpasses such post-Soviet Central Asian states as Uzbekistan and [[Turkmenistan]].  Its natural resources such as [[cotton]] and [[aluminum]] have contributed greatly to this steady improvement.

== نوم==
"''Tajikistan''" means the "Land of the [[Tajiks]]". Some believe that the name Tajik is a geographic reference to the crown (''Taj'') of the [[Pamir Knot]].

Tajikistan frequently appears as ''Tadjikistan'' or ''Tadzhikistan'' in English. This is due to a transliteration from the Russian ''Таджикистан.'' In Russian there is no single letter ''j'' to represent the phoneme /ʤ/ and ''дж'', or ''dzh'', is used. ''Tadzhikistan'' is the most common alternate spelling and is widely used in English literature derived from Russian sources. ''Tadjikistan'' is the spelling in French and can occasionally be found in English language texts.

Constroversy surrounds the correct term used to identify people from Tajikistan. The word ''Tajik'' has been the traditional term used to describe people from Tajikistan and appears widely in literature. But the ethnic politics of Central Asia have made the word ''Tajik'' a controversial word, as it implies that Tajikistan is only a nation for ethnic Tajiks and not ethnic Uzbeks, Russians etc. In addition, the [[Pamiri people|Pamiri]] population in [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] also have sought to create an ethnic identity separate from that of the Tajiks. There is a growing consensus that [[Tajikistani]], which is not ethnic specific and is inclusive of ethnic Tajiks and non-Tajiks alike, is the correct term to call people from Tajikistan.

== تاريخ==
{{main|History of Tajikistan}}

The land that is now Tajikistan has been inhabited continuously since 4,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. It has been under the rule of various empires throughout history, mostly the [[Persian Empire]]. Before [[Anno Domini|AD]], it was part of the [[Bactria]]n Empire. [[Arab]]s brought [[Islam]] in the [[7th century]]. The Persian [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]] supplanted the Arabs and built the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]], which became the cultural centers of Tajiks. The [[Mongols]] would later take partial control of Central Asia, and later the land that today comprises Tajikistan became a part of the emirate of Bukhara.  A small community of [[Jews]], displaced from the Middle East after the Babylonian captivity, migrated to the region and settled there after 600 BC, though the majority of Jews did not migrate to Tajikistan until the 20th century. 

In the [[19th century]], the [[Russian Empire]] began to spread into [[Central Asia]] during the [[Great Game]], and it took control of Tajikistan. After the overthrow of the [[Tsar]] in [[1917]], guerillas throughout Central Asia, known as ''[[basmachi]]'' waged a war against [[Bolshevik]] armies in a futile attempt to maintain independence. The Bolsheviks would prevail after a four year war, in which [[mosque]]s and villages were burned down and the population heavily suppressed.  Soviet authorities imposed a draconian secularization campaign, practicing [[Muslims]], [[Jews]], and Christians were heavily persecuted, and mosques, churches, and synagogues were closed.  

In 1924 the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created as a part of [[Uzbekistan]], but in [[1929]] the [[Tajik  Soviet Socialist Republic]] was made a separate constituent republic. [[Moscow]] did little to develop Tajikistan and it remained relatively behind other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]] in living conditions, education and industry. In the [[1970s]] dissident Islamic underground parties began to form and by the late 1980s Tajik nationalists were calling for increased rights. Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until [[1990]]. The following year, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Tajikistan declared its independence.

The nation almost immediately fell into a civil war that involved various factions fighting one another, these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. The non-Muslim population, particularly Russians and Jews, fled the country during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West.  [[Emomali Rahmonov]] came to power in 1992, and continues to rule to this day. However, he has been accused of ethnic cleansing against other ethnicities and groups during the [[Tajikistan Civil War]]. In [[1997]] a [[ceasefire]] was reached between Rahmonov and opposition parties ([[United Tajik Opposition]]). Peaceful elections were held in 1999, but they were reported by the opposition as unfair, and Rahmonov was re-elected by almost unanimous vote. [[Russia|Russian]] troops were stationed in southern Tajikistan, in order to guard the border with [[Afghanistan]], until summer [[2005]]. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], [[United States|American]] and [[France|French]] troops have also been stationed in the country.

== سياست==
{{morepolitics|country=Tajikistan}}

Almost immediately after independence, Tajikistan was plunged into a [[Tajikistan Civil War|civil war]] that saw various factions, allegedly backed by Russia and [[Iran]], fighting one another. All but 25,000 of the more than 400,000 ethnic Russians, who were mostly employed in [[industry]], fled to Russia. By [[1997]] the war had cooled down, and a central government began to take form, with peaceful elections in [[1999]].

Tajikistan is officially a [[republic]], and holds [[elections]] for the [[List of Presidents of Tajikistan|President]] and [[Parliament]]. The latest elections occurred in [[2005]], and as all previous elections, international observers believe them to have been corrupt, arousing many accusations from opposition parties that President [[Emomali Rahmonov]] manipulates the election process.

Tajikistan to this date is the only country in Central Asia to have included an active opposition in its government. In the Parliament, opposition groups have often clashed with the ruling party, but this has not led to great instability.

{{main|Geography of Tajikistan}}
[[Image:Tajikistan satellite photo.jpg|thumb|250px|Satellite photograph of Tajikistan]]

Tajikistan is landlocked, and is the smallest nation in [[Central Asia]] by area. It is covered by mountains of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] range, and more than fifty percent of the country is over 3,000 meters (approx. 10,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]]. The only major areas of lower land are in the north which is part of the Fergana Valley, and in the southern Kafirnigan and Vakhsh valleys which form the Amu Darya and have much higher rainfall. Dushanbe is located on the southern slopes above the Kafirnigan valley.

The [[Amu Darya]] and [[Panj River|Panj]] rivers mark the border with [[Afghanistan]], and Tajikistan's mountains are the major source of [[runoff (water)|runoff]] for the [[Aral Sea]] basin.

About 1% of the country's area is covered by lakes:

=== Exclaves ===

There are three Tajik [[exclave]]s [http://geosite.jankrogh.com/tajikistan.htm], all of them located in the [[Fergana Valley]] region where [[Kyrgyzstan]], Tajikistan and [[Uzbekistan]] meet. The largest is [[Vorukh]] (exclave area between 95&ndash;130 km²/37&ndash;50&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi, population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz, distributed among 17 villages), located 45 kilometres (28&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) south of [[Isfara]] on the right bank of the [[Karafshin]] river, in Kyrgyz territory. Another exclave in Kyrgyzstan is a small settlement near the Kyrgyz railway station of Kairagach. The last is the village of Sarvan, which includes a narrow, long strip of land (about 15&nbsp;km (9&nbsp;mi) long by 1&nbsp;km (over &frac12;&nbsp;mi) wide) alongside the road from [[Angren]] to [[Kokand]]; it is surrounded by Uzbek territory.

There are no enclaves within Tajikistan.

== اقتصاد==
{{main|Economy of Tajikistan}}

Tajikistan was the poorest country in Central Asia following a civil war after it became independent in 1991. With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon exports of cotton and aluminium, the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In FY 2000, international assistance remained an essential source of support for rehabilitation programs that reintegrated former civil war combatants into the civilian economy, thus helping keep the peace. International assistance also was necessary to address the second year of severe [[drought]] that resulted in a continued shortfall of food production. On [[August 21]]st, [[2001]], the [[Red Cross]] announced that a [[famine]] was striking Tajikistan, and called for international aid for Tajikistan and [[Uzbekistan]].  Tajikistan's economy grew substantially after the war. The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6% over the period of 2000-2004 according to the World Bank data. This improved Tajikistan's position among other Central Asian countries (namely Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), which seem to have degraded economically ever since.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Tajikistan}}

Tajikistan has a population of 7,011,556 (July 2004). The major ethnic group is the [[Tajiks|Tajik]], although there is a sizeable minority of [[Uzbek]]s, and a small population of [[Russians]], whose numbers are declining due to emigration. [[Pamiri people|Pamiris]] of [[Badakhshan]] are considered to belong to larger group of [[Tajiks]]. Likewise, the official language of Tajikistan is [[Tajik language|Tajik]], while [[Russian language|Russian]] is largely spoken in business and for government purposes. Although the Tajik and Uzbek are now classified as separate ethnic groups, on account of their languages, this is a relatively new phenomenon and originates from the conquest of Central Asia by the Russian Empire in the [[19th century]]. Despite its poverty, Tajikistan has a high rate of literacy with an estimated 98% of the population having the ability to read and write. Most of the population follows [[Sunni Islam]], although a sizeable number of [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] are present as well. [[Bukharan Jews]] had lived in Tajikistan since the 2nd century BC, but today only a few hundred remain. There is also a small population of [[Yaghnobi people]]. 

[[Image:Duschanbe Lenin.jpg|thumb|200px|A statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]] still stands in Tajikistan's capital of [[Dushanbe]].]]
The Tajik Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare reported that 104,272 disabled people are registered in Tajikistan (2000). This group of people suffers most from poverty in Tajikistan. The Tajik government and the World Bank considered activities to support this part of the population (described in the [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDS_IBank_Servlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112004011765]) Poverty Reduction Paper.

== فرهڼ==
{{main|Culture of Tajikistan}}

The culture of Tajikistan was originally shared with that of Uzbekistan, but during Communist rule, the cultural fabric of the region was disrupted by the Soviet leadership imposing artificial boundaries and the notion of nation-state - alien to the region - on the area. This has not been completely detrimental though, as Tajikistan was known for its theater and famous novelists during the Soviet era. Among these writers were individuals who strove to purify the [[Tajik language]] by tying it in more with [[Dari]] and eliminating Russian words and Arabic words.

Most citizens of Tajikistan are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]. The impact of Islam has grown in recent years, and was a strong bonding force during Tajikistan's fight against Soviet rule and during its civil war. Historically, a lot of Tajik culture ties it to the [[Persian Empire|Persia]]n past of the region, and Persian writers, scientists and poets such as [[Ibn Sina]], [[Firdausi]], [[Rudaki]], and [[Omar Khayyám]] are especially revered.

Tajikistan is home to a small Jewish community and used to have a [[synagogue]], the [[Dushanbe synagogue]]. 

The [[Yaghnobi people]] live in mountainous areas of northern Tajikistan. The estimated number of Yagnobians is now about 2500. Forced migrations have decimated their numbers.  They speak the [[Yaghnobi language]], which has its roots in the [[Sogdian language]].
