د '''تاجکستان جمهوريت''' ([[تاجکي ژبه|تاجکي]]: {{unicode|ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон}}, ''جمهوري تاجکستان'') په [[منځنۍ آسيا]] کې يو هېواد دی چې په غرونو کې کلابند دی. دا هېواد په سهېل کې د [[قرغزستان]] سره, په سوېل کې د [[افغانستان]] سره، په لوېديځه خوا د [[ازبکستان]] سره او په ختيځه خوا کې د [[چين]] سره ګډې پولې لري.

'''Tajikistan''' ({{pron-en|təˈdʒɪkɨstæn}} or {{IPA|/təˈdʒiːkɨstæn/}}; {{lang|tg|Тоҷикистон}} {{IPA-all|tɔd​͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn}}), officially the '''Republic of Tajikistan''' ({{lang-tg|Ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон}}, ''Jumhurii Tojikiston''), is a mountainous [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Asia]]. [[Afghanistan]] borders it to the south, [[Uzbekistan]] to the west, [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the north, and [[People's Republic of China]] to the east.  Tajikistan also lies adjacent to [[Pakistan]] but is separated by the narrow [[Wakhan Corridor]].

Most of Tajikistan's population belongs to the [[Tajik people|Tajik]] ethnic group, who share culture and history with the [[Iranian peoples]] and speak the [[Persian language]] (officially referred to as Tajiki in Tajikistan).  Once part of the [[Samanid dynasty|Samanid Empire]], Tajikistan became a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century, known as the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Tajik SSR). Mountains cover over 90% of this Central Asian republic.

After independence, Tajikistan suffered from a devastating [[Civil war in Tajikistan|civil war]] which lasted from 1992 to 1997.  Since the end of the war, newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country's economy to grow.  Trade in commodities such as [[cotton]] and [[aluminium]] wire has contributed greatly to this steady improvement. In Tajikistan about 20% of the population lives on less than US$1.25 per day.<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf UNDP: Human development indices - Table 3: Human and income poverty (Population living below national poverty line (2000-2007))]</ref> 
The Guiness Book of Records' holder for the title of "world's greatest quantity of turtles consumed in a single sitting" is Ordric Mercredy, naturalised Tajik but of [[Picayunian]] descent.


== Etymology ==
''Tajikistan'' means the "Land of the Tajiks" in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]. Some believe the name Tajik is a geographic reference to the crown (''Taj'') of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir Knot]], but this is a folk etymology. The word ''Tajik'' was used to differentiate Iranians from Turks in Central Asia, starting as early as the 10th century. The addition of 'k' might have been for the purpose of euphony in the set phrase ''Turk-o Tajik'' ("Turks and Tajiks") which in Persian-language histories is found as an idiomatic expression meaning "everyone."

Tajikistan frequently appeared as ''Tadjikistan'' or ''Tadzhikistan'' in English, [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] from the Russian Таджикистан (in Russian the phoneme /d​͡ʒ/ is represented as дж, i.e., ''dzh'' or ''dj''.) Tadzhikistan is the most common alternate spelling and is widely used in English literature derived from Russian sources. Tadjikistan is the spelling in French and can occasionally be found in English language texts. 

Controversy surrounds the correct term used to identify people from Tajikistan. The word ''Tajik'' has been the traditional term used to describe people from Tajikistan and appears widely in literature. But the ethnic politics of Central Asia have made the word Tajik a controversial word, as it implies that Tajikistan is only a nation for ethnic [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and not ethnic [[Uzbeks]], [[Russians]], etc. 

Likewise, ethnic Tajiks live in other countries, such as [[China]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], making the term ambiguous. In addition, elements among the [[Pamiri people|Pamiri]] population in Tajikistan's [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province|Gorno-Badakhshan region]] have at times sought to create an ethnic identity separate from that of the Tajiks.

== History ==
{{main|History of Tajikistan}}
=== Early history ===
{{seealso|Samanid dynasty}}
[[دوتنه:Somoni monument.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Modern Tajiks regard the [[Samanid|Samanid Empire]] as the first Tajik state. This monument in [[Dushanbe]] honors [[Ismail Samani]]<!--[[Saman Khuda]]-->, ancestor of the Samanids and a source of Tajik nationalism.]]
The territory of what is now Tajikistan has been inhabited continuously since 4000 [[Anno Domini|BCE]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It has been under the rule of various empires throughout history, for the longest period being part of the [[Persian Empire]].

Most of modern Tajikistan had formed parts of ancient [[Location of the Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] and [[Parama Kamboja]] kingdoms, which find references in the ancient Indian epics like the [[Mahabharata]]. [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] evidence, combined with ancient literary and inscriptional evidence has led many eminent [[Indologist]]s to conclude that ancient [[Kambojas]] originally belonged to the ''Ghalcha-speaking area'' of [[Central Asia]]. 

Acharya [[Yasaka]]'s [[Nirukta]]<ref> Nirukta II.2.</ref> (7th century BCE) attests that verb ''Śavati'' in the sense "to go" was used by only the Kambojas.  It has been shown that the modern [[Ghalcha]] [[dialect]]s, ''Valkhi, Shigali, Sriqoli, Jebaka (also called Sanglichi or Ishkashim), Munjani, Yidga and [[Yaghnobi]]'', mainly spoken in [[Pamir languages|Pamirs]] and countries on the headwaters of the [[Oxus]], still use terms derived from ancient Kamboja ''Śavati'' in the sense "to go".<ref>Linguistic Survey of India, Vol X, pp 456ff, 468, 473, 474, 476, 500, 511, 524 etc; Journal of Royal Asiatic Society of Asia, 1911, pp 801-802, Sir Griersen; India as Known to Panini, 1968, p 49, Dr V.

Kamboj; Sindhant Kaumudi Arthaprakashaka, 1966, pp 20-22, Acharya R. R. Pande.</ref>  The [[Yaghnobi language]], spoken by the [[Yaghnobi people|Yaghnobis]] in the [[Sughd Province]] around the headwaters of [[Zeravshan]] valley, also still contains a relic ''"Śu"'' from ancient Kamboja ''Śavati'' in the sense "to go".<ref> Proceedings and Transactions of the ... All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, p 118; Indian Culture, 1934, p 193, Indian Research Institute; Linguistic Survey of India, Vol X, pp 455-56, Dr G. A. Grierson; cf: History and Archeology of India's Contacts with Other Countries from the... , 1976, p 152, Dr Shashi P. Asthana - Social Science; Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 39, Dr Moti Chandra - India; Prācīna Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 128, Dr Jiyālāla Kāmboja, Dr Satyavrat Śāstrī - Kamboja (Pakistan).</ref> 

Further, Sir G Grierson says that the speech of [[Badakshan]] was a Ghalcha until about three centuries ago when it was supplanted by a form of [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref>Linguistic Survey of India, X, p. 456, Sir G Grierson; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, pp 107-108.</ref> Thus, the ancient Kamboja, probably included the [[Badakshan]], [[Pamirs]] and northern territories including the Yaghnobi region in the [[doab]] of the [[Oxus]] and [[Jaxartes]].<ref>Dr J. C. Vidyalankara, Proceedings and Transactions of 6th A.I.O. Conference, 1930, p 118; cf: Linguistic Survey of India, Vol X, pp 455-56, Dr G. A. Grierson.</ref> On the east it was bounded roughly by [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and/or [[Kashgar]], on the west by [[Bahlika]] ([[Uttaramadra]]), on the northwest by [[Sogdiana]], on the north by [[Uttarakuru]], on the southeast by [[Darada]], and on the south by [[Gandhara]]. 

Numerous Indologists locate original Kamboja in [[Pamirs]] and [[Badakshan]] and the [[Parama Kamboja]] further north, in the Trans-Pamirian territories comprising [[Zeravshan]] valley, north up parts of Sogdhiana/Fargana — in the Sakadvipa or [[Scythia]] of the classical writers.<ref>See: The Deeds of Harsha: Being a Cultural Study of Bāṇa's Harshacharita, 1969, p 199, Dr Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, p 118, Dr J. C. Vidyalankara; Prācīna Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, Dr Jiyālāla Kāmboja, Dr Satyavrat Śāstrī - Kamboja (Pakistan).</ref> 

Thus, in the pre-[[Buddhist]] times (7th–6th century [[BCE]]), the parts of modern Tajikistan including territories as far as Zeravshan valley in Sogdiana formed parts of ancient [[Location of the Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] and the [[Parama Kamboja]] kingdoms when it was ruled by the Indian [[Kambojas]] till it became part of Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. After the Persian Empire was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]], the region became the northern part of Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].
[[دوتنه:Dushanbe1.JPG|thumb|[[Dushanbe]], the capital of Tajikistan]]
From the last quarter of fourth century BCE until the first quarter of the second century BCE, it was part of the [[Bactria]]n Empire, from whom it was passed on to [[Scythian]] [[Tukharas]] and hence became part of [[Tukharistan]]. Contact with the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]] was made in the second century BCE, when envoys were sent to the area of Bactria to explore regions west of China.

[[Arab]]s brought [[Islam]] in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]]. The [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]] [[Iran]]ians supplanted the Arabs and enlarged the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]], which became the cultural centers of Tajiks (both of which are now in [[Uzbekistan]]). The [[Mongols]] would later take partial control of Central Asia, and later the land that today comprises Tajikistan became a part of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]].  A small community of [[Jews]], displaced from the Middle East after the Babylonian captivity, migrated to the region and settled there after 600 BCE, though the majority of the recent Jewish population did not migrate to Tajikistan until the 20th century.

=== Russian presence ===
{{seealso|The Great Game}}
In the 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] began to spread into [[Central Asia]] during the [[Great Game]]. Between 1864 and 1885 it gradually took control of the entire territory of [[Russian Turkestan]] from today's border with [[Kazakhstan]] in the north to the [[Caspian Sea]] in the west and the border with [[Afghanistan]] in the south. Tajikistan was eventually carved out of this territory, which historically had a large [[Tajik people|Tajik]] population. 

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|overthrow of Imperial Russia]] in 1917, guerrillas throughout Central Asia, known as ''[[basmachi]]'' waged a war against [[Bolshevik]] armies in a futile attempt to maintain independence. The Bolsheviks prevailed after a four-year war, in which [[mosque]]s and villages were burned down and the population heavily suppressed.  Soviet authorities started a campaign of secularization, practicing [[Muslims]], [[Jews]], and Christians were persecuted,{{Fact|date=April 2007}} and mosques, churches, and synagogues were closed.

=== Soviet Tajikistan ===
{{main|Tajik SSR}}
In 1924, the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created as a part of [[Uzbekistan]], but in 1929 the [[Tajik SSR|Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] ([[Tajik SSR]]) was made a separate constituent republic. The predominantly ethnic Tajik cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] remained in the [[Uzbek SSR]]. Between 1926 and 1959 the proportion of [[Russians]] among Tajikistan's population grew from less than 1% to 13%.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/tajikistan/23.htm Tajikistan - Ethnic Groups], ''U.S. Library of Congress''</ref> 

In terms of living conditions, education and industry Tajikistan was behind the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. In the 1980s, it had the lowest household saving rate in the USSR,<ref>Boris Rumer, ''Soviet Central Asia: A Tragic Experiment'', Unwin Hyman, London, 1989, p. 126.</ref> the lowest percentage of households in the two top per capita income groups,<ref>''Statistical Yearbook of the USSR 1990'', Goskomstat, Moscow, 1991, p. 115 {{ru icon}}.</ref> and the lowest rate of university graduates per 1000 people.<ref>''Statistical Yearbook of the USSR 1990'', Goskomstat, Moscow, 1991, p. 210 {{ru icon}}.</ref> 

By the late 1980s Tajik nationalists were calling for increased rights. Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until 1990. The following year, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Tajikistan declared its independence.

=== Post-independence ===
{{see also|Civil war in Tajikistan}}
[[دوتنه:Tajikfighter.jpg|thumb|A fighter in Tajikistan during the [[Civil war in Tajikistan|civil war]].]]
The nation almost immediately fell into a civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties.  The non-Muslim population, particularly Russians and Jews, fled the country during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. 

[[Emomalii Rahmon]] came to power in 1992, and continues to rule to this day. Ethnic cleansing was controversial during the [[civil war in Tajikistan]]. By the end of the war Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 50,000. Around 1.2 million people were [[refugee]]s inside and outside of the country.<ref>[http://www.un.org/events/tenstories_2006/story.asp?storyID=600 Tajikistan: rising from the ashes of civil war]. United Nations</ref> In 1997, a [[ceasefire]] was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties ([[United Tajik Opposition]]). 

Peaceful elections were held in 1999, but they were reported by the opposition as unfair, and Rahmon was re-elected by almost unanimous vote. [[Russia]]n troops were stationed in southern Tajikistan, in order to guard the border with [[Afghanistan]], until summer 2005. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], [[United States|American]], [[India]]n and [[France|French]] troops have also been stationed in the country.

In 2008, the harshest winter in a quarter century caused financial losses of $850 million. [[Russia]] pledged $1 billion in aid.<ref>[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1231398/ Tajikistan loses $850 million from cold winter]. Trading Markets.com</ref> [[Saudi Arabia]] sent about 10 planes carrying 80 tons of relief and emergency supplies in February and another 11 tons in March.<ref>[http://www.saudiembassy.net/2008News/News/NewsDetail.asp?cIndex=7754 Tenth Saudi relief plane leaves for Tajikistan].

[[دوتنه:Emomali Rahmonov 2001Nov03.jpg|thumb|left|President of Tajikistan, [[Emomali Rahmon]]]]
Almost immediately after independence, Tajikistan was plunged into a [[Tajikistan Civil War|civil war]] that saw various factions, allegedly backed by Russia and [[Iran]], fighting one another. All but 25,000 of the more than 400,000 ethnic Russians, who were mostly employed in [[industry]], fled to Russia. By 1997, the war had cooled down, and a central government began to take form, with peaceful elections in 1999.

"Longtime observers of Tajikistan often characterize the country as profoundly averse to risk and skeptical of promises of reform, a political passivity they trace to the country’s ruinous civil war," Ilan Greenberg wrote in a news article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' just before the country's November 2006 presidential election.<ref name=greenberg>Greenberg, Ilan, "Media Muzzled and Opponents Jailed, Tajikistan Readies for Vote," ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[November 4]], [[2006]] (article dateline [[November 3]], [[2006]]), page A7, New York edition</ref>

Tajikistan is officially a [[republic]], and holds [[elections]] for the [[List of Presidents of Tajikistan|President]] and [[Parliament]]. The latest parliamentary elections occurred in 2005 (two rounds in February and March), and international observers believe that the elections have been corrupt for some time, arousing many accusations from opposition parties that President [[Emomali Rahmon]] manipulates the election process.

The latest presidential election held on [[November 6]], [[2006]] was boycotted by "mainline" opposition parties, including the 23,000-member [[Islamist]] [[Islamic Renaissance Party]]. Four remaining opponents "all but endorsed the incumbent", Rahmon.<ref name=greenberg/>  After November 2006 presidential elections, it is widely speculated that Rahmon has secured his seat for at least another two terms, which will allow him rule until 2020.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Tajikistan to this date is one of the few countries in Central Asia to have included an active opposition in its government. In the Parliament, opposition groups have often clashed with the ruling party but this has not led to great instability.

Recently Tajikistan gave [[Iran]] its support in the membership bid to join the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], after a meeting with Tajik President and Iranian foreign minister.<ref>[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=48781&sectionid=351020101 Press TV - Iran makes move to join SCO<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|Provinces of Tajikistan|Districts of Tajikistan}}
Tajikistan consists of 4 administrative divisions. These are the provinces ([[viloyat]]) of [[Sughd]] and [[Khatlon]], the autonomous province of [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province|Gorno-Badakhshan]] (abbreviated as GBAO), and the [[Region of Republican Subordination]] (RRP – Raiony Respublikanskogo Podchineniya in [[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]] from Russian or NTJ – Ноҳияҳои тобеи ҷумҳурӣ in [[Tajik language|Tajik]]; formerly known as [[Karotegin Province]]). Each region is divided into several districts ({{lang-tg|Ноҳия}}, ''nohiya'' or ''raion''), which in turn are subdivided into ''jamoats'' (village-level self-governing units) and then villages (''qyshloqs''). As of 2006, there were 58 districts and 367 jamoats in Tajikistan.<ref name=pop2008/>

Tajikistan is landlocked, and is the smallest nation in Central Asia by area. It is covered by mountains of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] range, and more than fifty percent of the country is over 3,000 meters (approx. 10,000&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]]. The only major areas of lower land are in the north (part of the [[Fergana Valley]]), and in the southern [[Kofarnihon River|Kofarnihon]] and [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] river valleys, which form the Amu Darya. [[Dushanbe]] is located on the southern slopes above the Kofarnihon valley.

Following the Civil War of 1992 - 1997, Tajikistan was the poorest country in Central Asia as well in the former Soviet Union. With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon exports of cotton and aluminium, the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In FY 2000, international assistance remained an essential source of support for rehabilitation programs that reintegrated former civil war combatants into the civilian economy, thus helping keep the peace. International assistance also was necessary to address the second year of severe [[drought]] that resulted in a continued shortfall of food production. 

On [[August 21]], [[2001]], the [[Red Cross]] announced that a [[famine]] was striking Tajikistan, and called for international aid for Tajikistan and [[Uzbekistan]].  Tajikistan's economy grew substantially after the war. The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6 % over the period of 2000–2004 according to the World Bank data. This improved Tajikistan's position among other Central Asian countries (namely [[Turkmenistan]] and Uzbekistan), which seem to have degraded economically ever since.<ref>{{cite web

Tajikistan is an active member of the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO).

The recently completed [[Anzab tunnel]] which connects the previously hard to access Northern part of the country to the capital [[Dushanbe]] has been labeled as part of the new [[Silk Road]]. It is part of a road under construction that will connect Tajikistan to [[Iran]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] through [[Afghanistan]].

A new bridge between Afghanistan and Tajikistan has been built which will help the country have access to trade lines with [[South Asia]]. The bridge was built by the [[United States]].<ref name=usace>{{cite web

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Tajikistan}}
[[دوتنه:Old man from Tajikistan.jpg|thumb|Elderly man from Tajikistan]]
Tajikistan has a population of 7,349,145 (July 2009 est.)<ref name="CIAPeople"/>. [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] who speak the [[Tajik language]] (a variety of [[Persian language|Persian]]) are the main ethnic group, although there is a sizable minority of [[Uzbeks]] and a small population of [[Russians]], whose numbers are declining due to emigration.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], Robert Greenall, BBC News, 23 November 2005.</ref> In 1989, ethnic Russians made up 7.6% of the population.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/tajikistan/23.htm Tajikistan - Ethnic Groups]. Source: ''U.S. Library of Congress.''</ref> The [[Pamiri people|Pamiris]] of [[Badakhshan]] are considered to belong to the larger group of Tajiks. All citizens of Tajikistan are called Tajikistanis<ref name="CIAPeople"/> 

The official language of Tajikistan is the Tajik language, while [[Russian language|Russian]] is also largely spoken in business and other fields. Despite its poverty, Tajikistan has a high rate of literacy with an estimated 99.5% of the population having the ability to read and write.<ref name="CIAPeople"/> Most of the population follows [[Sunni Islam]], although a sizable number of [[Ismailis]] are present as well. 

[[Bukharian Jews]] had lived in Tajikistan since the 2nd century BC, but today almost none are left. There is also a small population of [[Yaghnobi people]] who have lived in the mountainous district of [[Sughd]] [[Viloyat]] for many centuries. The [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|German]] population in Tajikistan was 38,853 in 1979.<ref>[http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/history_culture/history/tajikistan.html Russian-Germans in Tajikistan].

The state's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare reported that 104,272 disabled people are registered in Tajikistan (2000). This group of people suffers most from poverty in Tajikistan. The government of Tajikistan and the World Bank considered activities to support this part of the population described in the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.<ref>{{cite web

[[دوتنه:Celebrating Eid in Tajikistan 10-13-2007.jpg|thumb|left|Tajik family celebrating [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]]]
Historically, Tajiks and Persians come from very similar stock, speaking variants of the same language and are related as part of the larger group of [[Iranian peoples]]. The [[Tajik language]] is the mother tongue of around 80% of the citizens of Tajikistan. The main urban centers in today's Tajikistan include [[Dushanbe]] (the capital), [[Khujand]], [[Kulob]], [[Panjakent]] and [[Istaravshan]].

The [[Pamiri people]] of [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] in the southeast, bordering [[Afghanistan]] and [[China]], though considered part of the [[Tajik people|Tajik ethnicity]], nevertheless are distinct linguistically and culturally from most [[Tajik people|Tajiks]]. In contrast to the mostly [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] residents of the rest of Tajikistan, the [[Pamiri]]s overwhelmingly follow the [[Ismaili]] sect of [[Islam]], and speak a number of [[Eastern Iranian]] languages, including [[Shughni]], [[Rushani language|Rushani]], [[Khufi language|Khufi]] and [[Wakhi]]. Isolated in the highest parts of the [[Pamir]] Mountains, they have preserved many ancient cultural traditions and folk arts that have been largely lost elsewhere in the country. 

The [[Yaghnobi people]] live in mountainous areas of northern Tajikistan. The estimated number of Yaghnobis is now about 25,000. Forced migrations in the 20th century decimated their numbers. They speak the [[Yaghnobi language]], which is the only direct modern descendant of the ancient [[Sogdian language]].

Tajikstan artisans created the [[Dushanbe Tea House]], which was presented in 1988 as a gift to the sister city of [[Boulder, Colorado]].<ref>[http://www.boulder-dushanbe.org/teahouse.html The Dushanbe-Boulder tea house]. Retrieved on 2 May 2009</ref>

== Religion ==
{{See also|Religion in Tajikistan|Islam in Tajikistan}}
[[دوتنه:Abdullokhon Mosque Isfara.jpg|thumb|A [[mosque]] in [[Isfara]]]]
Tajikistan claims to be a [[secular state]] with a Constitution providing for freedom of religion. The Government has declared two Islamic holidays, [[Eid ul-Fitr|Id Al‑Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha|Idi Qurbon]], as state holidays.  According to a 2009 [[U.S. State Department]] release, the population of Tajikistan is 98% [[Muslim]], (approximately 95% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and 3% [[Shia]]).<ref>http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5775.htm  Background Note: Tajikistan]</ref> The remaining 2% of population are [[Jews]] and [[Russian people|ethnic Russian]] followers of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]].  The great majority of Muslims fast during Ramadan, although only about one third in the countryside and 10% in the cities observe daily prayer and dietary restrictions.

Relationships between religious groups are generally amicable, although there is some concern among mainstream Muslim leaders that minority religious groups undermine national unity.  There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere.  The Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP), a major combatant in the [[Tajikistan Civil War|1992–1997 Civil War]] and then-proponent of the creation of an [[State religion#Islamic states|Islamic state]] in Tajikistan, constitutes no more than 30% of the government by statute.  Membership in [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (Party of Emancipation), a party which today aims for a nonviolent overthrow of secular governments and the unification of Tajiks under one Islamic state, is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment.  Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some feel this is discriminatory.

By law, religious communities must register by the State Committee on Religious Affairs (SCRA) and with local authorities.  Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. As noted above, religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of [[place of worship]].  There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain.<ref>[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=190 TAJIKISTAN: Religious freedom survey, November 2003] -[[Forum 18]] News Service, [[20 November]] [[2003]]</ref>

== Sport ==
Tajikistan's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as hill walking, mountain biking, and more challenging mountain climbing. Facilities are limited so tourists need to be largely self sufficient and plan carefully. Mountain climbing tours to the [[Fann Mountains]] and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], including the 7,000 m peaks in the region, are seasonally organized by local and international alpine agencies. 

Football is a popular sport. The [[Tajikistan national football team]] competes in the [[FIFA]] and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] leagues. It also hosts many football clubs.
