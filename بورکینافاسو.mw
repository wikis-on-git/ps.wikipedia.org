'''Burkina Faso''' is a [[landlocked]] nation in [[West Africa]]. It is surrounded by six countries: [[مالي]] to the north, [[نايجېر]] to the east, [[Benin]] to the south east, [[توګو]] and [[ګانا]] to the south, and [[عاج ساحل]] to the south west. Formerly the [[Republic]] of [[Upper Volta]], [[Geographical renaming|it was renamed]] on [[August 4]], [[1984]] by President [[Thomas Sankara]] to mean "the land of upright people" (or "upright land") in [[Mossi]] and [[Dioula]], the major native languages of the country. Independence from [[France]] came in 1960. Governmental instability during the 1970s and 1980s was followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Several hundred thousand farm workers migrate south every year to [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]] in search of [[Unemployment|paid labour]]. The inhabitants of Burkina Faso are known as [[Burkinabé]]. 

== تاريخ==
{{main|History of Burkina Faso}}

=== Prehistory ===
Like all of the west of Africa, Burkina Faso was populated early, notably by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the north-western part of the country (12 000 to 5000 BC), and whose tools (scrapers, chisels and arrowheads) were discovered in 1973. Settlements appeared between 3600 and 2600 [[Anno Domini|BC]] with farmers, the traces of whose structures leave the impression of relatively permanent buildings. The use of iron, ceramics and polished stone developed between 1500 and 1000 BC, as well as a preoccupation with spiritual matters, as shown by the burial remains which have been discovered.

Relics of the [[Dogon]] are found in the centre-north, north and north west region. They left the area between the 15th and 16th centuries BC to settle in the cliffs of Bandiagara. Elsewhere, the remains of high walls are localised in the south west of Burkina Faso (as well as in the Côte d'Ivoire), but the people who built them have not yet been definitely identified.

Burkina Faso was a very important economic region for the [[Songhai Empire]] during the 15th and 16th centuries.

=== From colony to independence ===
In 1896, the Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou became a French protectorate after being defeated by French forces. In 1898, the majority of the region corresponding to Burkina Faso today was conquered. In 1904, these territories were integrated into [[French West Africa]] in the heart of the Upper-Senegal-Niger (Haut-Sénégal-Niger) colony.

Its inhabitants participated in the [[World War I|First World War]] in the heart of the battalions of the [[Senegalese Infantry]] (Tirailleurs sénégalais). It was originally administered as part of Côte d'Ivoire colony, but became a separate colony in 1919. On [[March 1]] [[1919]], [[François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling]] became the first governor of the new colony of Upper-Volta, which was broken up [[September 5]] [[1932]], being shared between the Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Niger.

On [[September 4]] [[1947]] Upper-Volta was recreated with its 1932 boundaries. On [[December 11]] [[1958]], it achieved self-government, and became a republic and member of the Franco-African Community (La Communauté Franco-Africaine). Full independence was attained in 1960.  The country's first military coup occurred in 1966; it returned to civilian rule in 1978. There was another coup, led by [[Saye Zerbo]] in 1980, which in turn was overthrown in 1982.  A counter-coup was launched in 1983, which left Captain [[Thomas Sankara]] in charge. The current president is [[Blaise Compaoré]], who came to power in 1987 after a [[coup d'état]] that killed  [[Thomas Sankara]].

== سياست==
{{main|Politics of Burkina Faso}}
[[Image:Blaise Compaoré.jpeg|thumb|President Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso, Source: Antônio Cruz]]
The constitution of [[June 2]], [[1991]], established a semi-presidential government with a [[parliament]] (Assemblée) which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of 5 years. The year 2000 saw a [[constitution]]al amendment reducing the presidential term from 7 to 5 years, enforceable as from 2005, when new presidential elections will be held. Another change according to the amendment would have prevented sitting president [[Blaise Compaoré]] from being re-elected. However, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that because Compaoré was already a sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office, thereby clearing the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On [[November 13]] Compaoré was reelected in a landslide due to a divided political opposition.  The parliament consists of two chambers: the lower house (l'Assemblée Nationale) and the upper house (la Chambre des Représentants). There is also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles are purely consultative.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Burkina Faso Map.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Map of Burkina Faso]]
{{main|Geography of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso is made up of two major types of countryside:
* The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]] which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[precambrian]] [[massif]].

* The south-west of the country forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak is found: Ténakourou (749 m, 2,450 ft). The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to 150 [[metre]]s (490&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) high.

The average altitude is 400 metres (1,300&nbsp;ft) and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than 600 metres (2,000&nbsp;ft). Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country, with a very few localised exceptions.

=== Hydrography ===
The country owed its [[geographical renaming|former name]] of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: le Mouhoun (formerly called the [[Black Volta]]), le Nakambé (the [[White Volta]]) and le Nazinon (the [[Red Volta]]). Le Mouhoun, along with la Comoé which flows to the south west, is the country's only river which flows year-round

The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[Watershed|drains]] 27% of the country's surface. Its [[Tributary|tributaries]] (le Béli, le Gorouol, le Goudébo and le Dargol) are [[Stream#Intermittent_and_ephemeral_streams|seasonal streams]], and only flow for 4 to 6 months a year but can cause large [[Flood|flood]]s.

The country also contains numerous lakes. The principal lakes are [[Tingrela]], [[Lake Bam|Bam]] and [[Dem]], and the large ponds of [[Oursi]], [[Béli]], [[Yomboli]] and [[Markoye]].

[[Drought|Water shortage]]s are often a problem, especially in the north of the county.

== Climate ==
[[Image:Burkina Faso - Tolotama Reforestation.jpg|thumb|Tolotama Reforestation, Burkina Faso]]
Burkina Faso has a primarily [[Tropics|tropical]] climate with two very distinct seasons: the rainy season with between 24-35 [[inch]]es (600 and 900 mm) of rainfall, and the dry season during which the [[harmattan]] blows, a hot dry wind from the Sahara. The rainy season lasts approximately 4 months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country.

Three large climatic zones can be defined:
=== The Sahel zone === 
The [[Sahel]] in the north receives less than 24 [[inch]]es (600 [[Millimeter|mm]]) rainfall a year and high temperatures 15&ndash;50&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (60&ndash;120&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]). A relatively dry [[tropical savanna]], the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and borders the [[Sahara]] to its north, and the fertile region of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] to the South.

=== The Sudan-Sahel zone ===
Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north [[latitude]], the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature.

=== The Sudan-Guinea zone ===
Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than 35 inches (900 mm) rain a year and cooler average temperatures.

{{main|Economy of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world. This can be explained by its population growth and its arid soil. [[Agriculture]] represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population. It consists mostly of livestock but also, especially in the south and southwest, of growing sorghum, millet, maize (corn), peanuts, rice and cotton.

Lack of work causes a high rate of emigration: for example, three million people from Burkina Faso live in [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. According to the Central Bank of Western African States (La Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest), these migrants send tens of billions of CFA francs back to Burkina Faso each year. Since the 1967 expulsions from [[Ghana]], this situation has provoked tensions in the destination countries. The most recent crisis occurred owing to the events of 2003 in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], which led to the return of 300&nbsp;000 migrants.

A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid.

There is mineral exploitation of [[copper]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and, above all, [[gold]].

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Ouagadougou place nations unies.JPG|thumb|United Nations Square in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso]]
[[Image:Burkina Faso - Sala Well.jpg|thumb|Sala Well]]
{{main|Demographics of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso has an estimated life expectancy at birth of slightly under 50 years of age.  The median age of its inhabitants is under 17.

Population growth rate: 2.71% (2000 est.)

Population estimates take into account the effects of excess mortality due to [[AIDS]]; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2000 est.): the 11,946,065 ''Burkinabe'' belong to two major West African cultural groups--the [[Voltaic]] and the [[Mande]]. The Voltaic are far more numerous and include the [[Mossi]], who make up about one-half of the population.  Additionally, about 5,000 [[Europe]]ans live in Burkina Faso.

The population is concentrated in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer (125/[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi.]]). This high population density, causes annual migrations of hundreds of thousands, for seasonal employment. 

Besides traditional African religions, [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are also practised.

== Education ==
{{main|Education in Burkina Faso}}
Education in Burkina Faso is structured primary, secondary, and higher education. Education is technically free and officially mandatory until the age of 16, however few Burkinabe have had formal education.  Though schooling is free, it is not compulsory, and only about 35% of Burkina's primary school-age children receive a basic education. Institutions of higher education include the [[University of Ouagadougou]], and The Polytechnical University in  [[Bobo-Dioulasso]].

At 26.6%, Burkina Faso is the most illiterate country in Africa.([[CIA World Factbook]], November 2005)
