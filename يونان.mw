'''Greece''', ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ελλάδα ''Elládha'' [[IPA]] [{{IPA|e̞ˈlaða}}] or Ελλάς ''Hellás'' [[IPA]] [{{IPA|e̞ˈlas}}]), officially the '''Hellenic Republic''' (Greek: Ελληνική [[wikt: δημοκρατία|Δημοκρατία]] ''Ellinikí Dhimokratía'') is a country in [[southern Europe|southern]] [[Europe]], situated on the southern end of the [[Balkan peninsula]]. It is bordered by [[بلغاريه/بلغارستان]], the [[مقدونيه]] and [[البانيا]] to the north and by [[ترکيه]] to the east. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of mainland Greece while the [[Ionian Sea]] lies to the west. Both, parts of the eastern [[Mediterranean]] basin, feature a vast number of islands. Regarded as the cradle of [[western world|western civilization]] and being the birthplace of [[democracy]], [[sport]] (most notably as the birthplace of the [[Olympic Games]]), and arts such as the [[theater]], Greece has a very long and remarkably rich history during which its culture has proven especially influential in [[Europe]], [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. Today, Greece is a [[developed nation]], member of the [[European Union]] since [[1981]] and also a member of the [[Eurozone]] since [[2001]].

== Name ==
{{main|Names of the Greeks}}

The historical name of Greece in Greek is {{Polytonic|Ἑλλάς}} ''Ellás'' {{IPA|/ɛˈlas/}}<!--Please note: IPA accent is written *before* the accented syllable, not after the accented vowel-->.  This name is also written as ''Hellas'' in English, following the [[ancient Greek|ancient]] [[Greek language|Greek]] pronunciation {{IPA|/hɛˈl:as/}}. In [[Modern Greek]], it is called more commonly Ελλάδα ''Elládha'' {{IPA|/ɛˈlaða/}}.

In most European languages, however, the name of Greece comes from the ancient root {{Polytonic|Γραικός}} ''Graikós'' (''via'' Latin ''[[Graecus]]''): [[English language|English]] ''Greece'', [[French language|French]] ''Grèce'', [[German language|German]] ''Griechenland'', ''etc.''  In most Middle Eastern and Eastern languages, it comes from the root {{Polytonic|Ἰωνία}} ''[[Ionia|Iōnía]]'': ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Yunanistan'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Urdu]]:  يونان (Yawnan), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: יוון(Yavan), [[Malay language|Malay]]: Yunani).  In only a few languages is the "Hellas" root the basis of the local name —- [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: Hellas, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 希臘 (Xīlà), and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Hy Lạp.

=== International abbreviations ===
*'''GR''': used on Greek number plates to indicate the country of registration of the vehicle.
*'''gr''':  used to indicate the Greek provenance of websites, as in '.gr'.
*'''GRE''': used at international sporting events.

('''El''' or '''el''' is used on documents by the [[European Union]] to indicate the [[Greek language]], not the country).

== History ==
{{main|History of Greece}}
=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
The shores of Greece's [[Aegean Sea]] saw the emergence of the first civilizations in Europe, namely the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and the [[Mycenae|Mycenaean]].  After this, a Dark Age followed until around [[800 BC]], when a new era of Greek [[polis|city-states]] emerged, establishing colonies along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and a [[Greek alphabet|new alphabet]] was introduced.[http://www.mfa.gr/english/greece/living/read_greek/alphabet.html]. [[Plato]] described how the Greeks live round the Aegean Archipelago "like frogs around a pond"; their name has always been associated with the sea. After the internal struggle between Spartans and Athenians,all parts of Greece were united under the rule of Alexander the Great and aimed at the defeat of the 'eastern threat' of the Persians.Alexander led the Greeks to a victorious campaign which established a Greek Empire and introduced a new era in world history, the Hellenistic.

=== Byzantine period ===
Militarily, Greece itself declined to the point that the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered the land ([[168 BC]] onwards), though, in many ways, Greek culture would in turn conquer Roman life. Greece became a province of the [[Roman Empire]], but Greek culture continued to dominate the eastern Mediterranean. When the Roman Empire finally split in two, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], known as the Byzantine Empire, centered around [[Constantinople]] (known in ancient times as [[Byzantium]]), remained Greek in nature, encompassing Greece itself. 
[[Image:Ac.christimage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The most famous of the surviving Byzantine mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople - the image of Christ on the walls of the upper southern gallery. Christ is flanked by the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. The mosaics were made in the 12th century.]]
During the period of the [[Byzantine Empire]] Greece experienced fluctuating fortunes. In the early years many of its works of art were looted by the emperors and taken to Constantinople. Furthermore, although the Byzantines retained control of the Aegean and its islands throughout this period, during the seventh and eighth centuries direct control did not extend far beyond the coast. From about [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;[[600]] the old cities of Greece shrank considerably due to barbarian raids by the [[Avars]] and [[Slavs]], and were often reduced to shadows of their former selves. As the seventh century progressed, much of Greece was overrun by Slavic peoples from the north, and a period of uncertainty and insecurity followed.

From the late 8th century, the Empire began to recover from the devastating impact of successive invasions, and the reconquest of Greece began. Greeks from [[Sicily]] and [[Asia Minor]] were brought in as settlers. The Slavs were either driven out or assimilated. By the middle of the 9th century, Greece was Greek again, and the cities began to recover due to improved security and the restoration of effective central control.

The invasions of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] after the battle of [[Manzikert]] in 1071 and the ensuing civil wars largely passed the region by, and Greece continued its provincial existence unharmed. When the Byzantine Empire was rescued by the resolute leadership of the three Comnenus emperors [[Alexius I]], [[John II]] and [[Manuel I Comnenus]], Greece prospered. Archaeological evidence tells us that many of the medieval towns, including [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the eleventh century and continuing until the end of the twelfth century. The growth of the towns attracted the Venetians, and this interest in trade appears to have further increased economic prosperity in Greece.

The 11th and 12th centuries are said to be the Golden Age of [[Byzantine art]] in Greece. Many of the most important Byzantine churches in and around Athens, for example, were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of urbanisation in Greece during this period. 

However, this medieval prosperity was not to last: During the period 1204 to 1458 Greece was fought over by the Byzantines and the French and Italian knights of the Latin Empire. 

From the [[4th century]] to the [[15th century]], the Byzantine Empire had survived eleven centuries of attacks from the north, west and east until [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell]] on [[May 29]] [[1453]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Its last emperor, [[Constantine XI]], died fighting on the walls and was buried anonymously along with his troops. The empire had been for centuries the centre of Christendom, spanning the period from the ancient classical world of the Roman Empire to the dawn of the Renaissance. Throughout this medieval era it had remained a source of constancy. However, a new age was dawning: Greece was gradually conquered by the Ottomans during the [[15th century]].

===Ottoman period===
[[Image:Vryzakis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Theodore Vryzakis, ''The sortie of Messologhi'']] 
While the [[Ottomans]] were completing the main conquest of the Greek Mainland, two Greek migrations occurred. The first migration saw the Greek intelligentsia migrate to [[Western Europe]] — especially to Italy — and contribute to the advent of the [[Renaissance]]. The second migration of Greeks left the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettled in the mountains, the islands and Greek regions outside Ottoman control. In the mountainous regions, the Ottomans were unable to create a permanent military and administrative presence. As a result some Greek mountain clans across the peninsula, as well as some islands, were able to maintain a status of independence. The Sphakiots of [[Crete]], the [[Souliots]] from Souli of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and the Maniots from [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] of [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] were the most resilient mountain clans throughout the Ottoman Empire. By the end of the 16th century and until the 17th century, Greeks began to migrate back to the plains and cities, adding to the increasing urban population. The [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system contributed to the ethnic cohesion of Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the Ottoman Empire based on religion. The [[Orthodox]] Church, a religious institution with a keen sense of its national character, contributed to the Greeks from all geographical areas of the peninsula (i.e. mountains, plains, and islands) to preserve their ethnic, cultural and linguistic heritage during the years of the Ottoman rule (although at the time it was not strictly speaking a "Greek" church — the Greek Church was instituted after the liberation).  The Greeks who remained on the plains during Ottoman occupation were either Christians, who dealt with the burdens of foreign rule, or to a considerable extent Crypto-Christians (Greek Muslims who were secret practitioners of the Orthodox faith) in order to avoid heavy taxation. The Greeks who converted to [[Islam]] and were not Crypto-Christians became [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] in the eyes of Orthodox Greeks. Therefore, there was no recognition of "Greek Muslims", or of "Christian Turks". As a result, religion played an integral part in the formation of the Modern Greek and other post-Ottoman national identities.

=== Creation of the modern Greek state ===
The Ottomans ruled Greece until the early [[19th century]]. In 1821, the Greeks and their allies [[Greek War of Independence|rebelled and declared their independence]], but did not succeed until 1829. The elites of powerful European nations saw the war of Greek independence, with its accounts of Turkish [[atrocity|atrocities]], in a romantic light (see, for example, the 1824 painting ''the Massacre of [[Chios]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]). Scores of non-Greeks volunteered to fight for the cause &mdash; including people like [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]].  At times the Ottomans seemed on the verge of entirely suppressing the Greek revolution but were eventually forced to give in by the direct military intervention of [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and [[Russia]]. This was the prelude of the so called "[[Eastern Question]]", the gradual dismemberment of the decaying empire by the western powers.  The Russian ex-minister of foreign affairs, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], himself a Greek noble from the Ionian Islands, was chosen as President of the new Republic following Greek independence. However, that republic was soon dissolved by the Great Powers which then installed a "Greek" monarchy. The Great Powers did not wish the Greeks to govern themselves and also claimed that they were not capable to do so; as such they looked elsewhere for a prospective monarch. The first king, [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Bavaria]], was of the German [[Wittelsbach|House of Wittelsbach]] and the subsequent line was from the Germano-Danish [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|House of Oldenburg]]. During the 19th and especially the early [[20th century|20th]] centuries, in a series of wars with the Ottomans, Greece sought to enlarge its boundaries to include the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman Empire (the Ionian Islands were donated by Britain upon the arrival of the new king from Denmark in 1863, and Thessaly was ceded by the Ottomans without a fight). Greece would slowly grow in territory and population until reaching its present configuration in 1947.

===World War I and its aftermath===
[[Image:He-ref-chios-painting.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Eugène Delacroix]], Massacre at Chios]]
In [[World War I]], Greece sided with the [[entente]] powers against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the other [[Central Powers]]. In the war's aftermath, the [[Great Powers]] awarded a small part of [[Asia Minor]] to Greece, centered around the city of [[Smyrna]] (known as [[Izmir]] today) which had a majority Greek population. At that time, however, the Turkish nationalists, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], denounced the Sultan's government in Istanbul and formed a new one in Ankara. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] the Turks eventually defeated the  Greek armies and regained control of Asia Minor. Soon afterwards, the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed, fixing the borders to this date. A population exchange was included in the agreement and immediately afterwards, around five hundred thousand Turks (including Muslim Greeks) then living in mainland Greek territory left for Turkey in [[Population exchange#Turkey and Greece: population exchange.2C 1922|exchange]] for more than 1.22 million Greek residents of Asia Minor (excluding [[Constantinople]], Imvros and Tenedos).

In 1936, General [[Ioannis Metaxas]] established an [[authoritarian]] [[conservative]] [[dictatorship]] in Greece known as the [[4th of August Regime]]. Greece under Metaxas is compared to Spain at the time, although it lacked the political violence associated with [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime.

===World War II===
On [[28 October]] [[1940]], the [[Italy|Italian]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] called on the Greeks to allow the troops to enter the country and to surrender its arms. Though Greece was alone and most of Europe occupied by the Axis, the Greek government gave a simple negative response (see [[Oxi Day]])- thereby immediately siding with the [[Allies]]. The Italian troops poured over from Albania. The Greek counter-attack along the Albanian front gave the [[Allies]] their first victory against the [[Axis]] forces (see [[Greco-Italian War]]).  Eventually, Mussolini's armies were saved from defeat with the intervention of Italy's [[Axis]] ally, [[Germany]] since [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and his generals needed to secure their strategic southern flank. German forces whose ranks included troops from [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Italy]] successfully invaded Greece, overran and occupied Greece in April-May 1941 (Operation Marita). Germany held onto the country until 1944, when the Greek resistance and British, [[Australian]] and [[New Zealand]] forces liberated the country.

In May 1941, to reduce the threat of a counter-offensive by Allied forces in [[Egypt]], the Germans attempted to [[Battle of Crete|seize Crete]] in a massive attack by [[paratroop]]s. Allied forces, along with Cretan civilians, however, offered fierce resistance. Although Crete eventually fell, it is pointed out by historians and even the significant figures of the war:
 
 Hitler 1889-1945.(Head of German state 1889-1945)
"Due to the historical truth, I owe to declare that only the Greeks, from all opponents that faced me, fought with daring courage without never caring of their lives."
 (From his speech on 4 May 1941 at Reichstag.)

that this, and the whole Greek campaign, delayed German plans significantly, with the result that the German
invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] started fatally close to winter. In addition, the extremely heavy losses of [[paratroop]] forces sustained by the Germans in Crete foiled a planned German campaign in the Middle East against British-held Iraq and its oil fields. 

During the years of [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation, hundreds of thousands of Greeks died in direct combat, in concentration camps, or of starvation. The winter of 1941-1942 was especially brutal, as the occupying forces carried out a country-wide, systematic confiscation of all foodstuffs as punishment for delaying critical German war plans in Eastern Europe. By January of 1942, tens of thousands of people a week were dying of starvation in Greece{{fact}}. Ultimately, the threat of a general rebellion was used by the Archibishop Damaskinos of Athens to convince the Germans to relent and abandon the confiscation of food in the spring of 1942. Greek partisan resistance to the occupation was fierce, often with bitter retaliation from the occupiers. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the massacre at Kalavrita, where the entire male population (1258 men) of the city of Kalavrita were executed on a single day. The occupiers murdered the greater part of the [[Jewish]] community despite efforts by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Church and many [[Christian]] Greeks to shelter their Jewish co-citizens. The Jewish community of [[Thessaloniki]] suffered the heaviest toll by far. During the war the Greek economy languished. After liberation, Greece experienced an equally bitter [[Greek Civil War]] between the communist-led [[Democratic Army]] and the [[Hellenic Army]] that lasted until 1949, when the communists were defeated in the battle of Grammos-Vitsi.

===Post-war development and turmoil===
During the 1950s and 1960s, Greece experienced gradual and consistent economic growth, aided by significant grants and loans by the [[United States]] through the [[Marshall Plan|Marshall]] Plan. However, starting in [[1965]], a series of turbulent political events unfolded that led to severe political uncertainty. The crisis eventually got out hand for both the elected government and King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] and ended dramatically in the early hours of [[April 21]], [[1967]]. That morning, a coordinated effort by a number of Colonels and other military officials succeeded in a [[coup d'etat]] and they soon managed to establish a fierce [[military junta]]. General elections planned by the conservative government to be held on May 28 never took place. In the following years, a number of supporters of the left wing as well as a number of politicians and [[communist]]s were arrested and brutally tortured by the regime. Other politicians, however, evaded capture and found political refuge in such European countries as [[France]] and [[Sweden]]. Nevertheless, the then head of state, former [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine]] officially acknowleged the new regime and it was duly recognized by the international community. Diplomatic relations continued unabated. In 1973, however, the junta abolished the [[Kings of Greece|Greek monarchy]]. Later that same year, in October of 1973, the head of the junta, colonel [[George Papadopoulos]] appointed politician [[Spiros Markezinis]] as the Prime Minister. A few weeks later on [[November 14]], law students that opposed the regime realized that the obvious parody of a government would not end unless they took action. They took control of the [[Athens Law School]] and in so doing inspired the students of the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic School]], who imitated them. 

It should be noted that institutions of higher education in Greece are considered to provide political asylum. By [[November 16]], however, the streets around the Polytechnic School resembled a battlefield, leaving no choice for the junta than to respond with military tactics. In the early hours of November 17, a tank smashed the gate of the historical building of the Athens Polytechnic School causing tragic bloodshed. More than 20 students were killed. However, the now-famous [[Athens Polytechnic Uprising]] marked the beginning of a series of events that would eventually result to the end of Papadopoulos' rule. One week later, on November 25 both Papadopoulos and Markezinis were overthrown by a countercoup headed by junta hardliner Brigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannides|Ioannides]]. A new head, [[Phaedon Gizikis]], and a new Prime Minister, [[Adamantios Androutsopoulos]], were appointed by the regime. Ioannides, however, had even more in his mind. The following July, he backed a planned coup d'etat to overthrow the Cypriot President, Archibishop [[Makarios III|Makarios]]. This gave a pretext for neighbouring Turkey to intervene militarily, alledgedly to protect the Turkish minority that resided on the island. [[Turkey]] invaded [[Cyprus]] on [[July 20]], [[1974]] and managed to occupy the northern part or a third of its territory. The colonels did not succeed in either predicting the Turkish action or in effectively mobilizing their armed forces in order to prevent it. This signaled the end for the regime that collapsed within a matter of days.

===Newfound stability===
In the evening of [[July 23]], [[1974]], ex Premier [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was invited back from [[Paris]] where he had found a political refuge. In the morning hours of the following day, the plane carrying him landed in [[Athens]] amidst massive celebrations by cheering crowds that could not believe that the ordeal they had to endure for seven years was over. Karamanlis was immediately appointed as the interim prime minister under President [[Phaedon Gizikis|Gizikis]]. Karamanlis founded the [[conservative]] [[New Democracy|Nea Dimokratia]] party and he then won the elections. Democracy had finally been restored and a democratic republican constitution came into force in 1975. In addition, a referendum held that same year, confirmed the will of the overwhelming majority of the Greek people to abolish the monarchy - this time democratically. Therefore former King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] and his family remained in Britain and were not allowed free access to the country until 2004. Meanwhile, yet another prominent figure of the past, charismatic politician [[Andreas Papandreou]] had also returned from the [[United States]] and he had already founded the Panhellenic Socialist Party or [[PASOK]]. Karamanlis won the [[1977]] parliamentary elections as well but he resigned in [[1980]], giving his way to [[George Rallis]]. However, Papandreou won the elections held on [[October 18]], [[1981]] by landslide and he formed the first socialist government in the history of the nation. Papandreou dominated the Greek political course for almost 15 years, up until his death in [[June 23]], [[1996]].

===Greece as a member of the European Union===
The country became the tenth member of the [[European Union]] on [[January 1]], [[1981]]. Over the course of the last 25 years, and particularly during this past decade, Greece has experienced a remarkable economic growth. Massive, widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure as well as funds from the European Union and impressively growing revenues from tourism, shipping and services have greatly raised the standard of living to unprecedented levels. The country adopted the [[Euro]] in [[2001]]. With a [[GDP per capita]] now standing at $22,800 and a growth rate well above European Union's average, Greece is a prosperous nation. Nevertheless, everyone agrees that the government still has to deal with certain economic issues so as to enable the country to use its full potentials and reach the standard of living of the richest nations in [[Europe]].

===The successful battle against domestic terrorism===
In [[June 2002]], Greek police achieved a major breakthrough in dealing with domestic terrorism when it managed to arrest the members of the notorious [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November]] terrorist group. The group had formed in [[1974]] and it was responsible for the killing of several American, British and Turkish officials residing in Greece as well as for the killing of prominent Greek politicians (such as Pavlos Bakoyiannis, late husband of the newly appointed Foreign Minister, [[Dora Bakoyannis]]). The trial of those arrested was held in [[March 2003]] and all of them are now behind bars. Still, however, some people believe there is a chance that certain non-key members may have escaped arrest.

===Greco-Turkish relations===
{{main|Greco-Turkish relations}}
Relations between Greece and neighboring [[Turkey]] have improved substantially over the course of the past 6 years, after successive earthquakes hit both countries in the summer of [[1999]]. The so called "earthquake diplomacy" came after an unprecedented outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance provided by ordinary Greeks and Turks in each of those cases. Greece was the first one to take the initiative to provide valuable help after a monstrous, magnitude 7.4 [[earthquake]] leveled much of the Turkish northwest on [[August 17]], [[1999]], killing more than 17,000 people. Turks also responded immediately after a magnitude 5.9 quake jolted [[Athens]] on [[September 7]] of that same year, killing 143 people. These generous, brave acts took many foreigners by surprise and led to a considerable breakthrough in bilateral relations, marred by decades of hostility over territorial disputes and the situation in the divided island of [[Cyprus]]. In [[January 1996]], the countries reached the brink of war over the tiny, uninhabited islets of [[Imia/Kardak]], situated in the southeastern [[Aegean Sea]]. While Greece insisted that according to all treaties and conventions the islets belong to Greece, Turks claimed that the relevant articles were rather unclear. The crisis escalated within only a few days and it was only after the personal intervention of U.S President [[Bill Clinton]] that it came to an end. Ten years later, Greece has become one of the chief advocates of Turkey's struggle to enter the [[European Union]] while Greek prime minister, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] was one of the best men at the wedding of the daughter of Turkey's prime minister.

===The 2004 Olympic Games===
{{main|2004 Olympic Games}}
On [[September 5]], [[1997]], the International Olympic Committee awarded the [[2004 Olympic Games]] to [[Athens]]. The massive preparations that followed literally transformed the Greek capital. Some concerns were raised by certain foreign media over Greece's ability to meet specific construction deadlines as well as its ability to handle a potential terrorist attack. However, by the end of the games Greece was  judged by  the international media  to have decisively proven  wrong  those who questioned its ability to stage the event, and  immediately after the closing ceremonies many editorials in the international  press  actually offered apologies, admitting an overreaction.  The [[2004 Olympic Games]] were widely  hailed as a spectacular success.

== Politics ==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:KOSTA KARAMANLIS.jpg|frame|right|Kostas Karamanlis, Prime minister of Greece]] -->
{{main|Politics of Greece}}
The 1975 [[constitution]] includes extensive specific guarantees of civil liberties. The President of the Republic, elected by an increased majority of the Parliament for a term of five years, is nominally the Head of State.

However, it is the [[Prime Minister]] and [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], as well as the Vouli (parliament) that play the central role in the political process, while the president performs limited governmental functions, in addition to ceremonial duties.

Greeks elect the 300 members of the country's [[unicameral]] parliament (the ''[[Vouli ton Ellinon]]'') by secret ballot for a maximum of four years, but elections can occur at more frequent intervals. Greece uses a complex reinforced [[proportional representation]] electoral system which discourages splinter parties and ensures that the party which leads in the national vote will win a majority of seats. A party  must receive 3% minimum of the total national vote to gain representation. Typically, a 41%+ is sufficient to guarantee the rule by a single party.

Greek parliamentary politics hinge upon the principle of the "''dedilomeni''", the "declared confidence" of Parliament to the Prime Minister and his/her administration. This means that the President of the Republic is bound to appoint as Prime Minister a person who will be approved by a majority of the Parilament's members (i.e. 151 votes). With the current electoral system, it is the leader of the party gaining a plurality of the votes in the Parliamentary elections who gets appointed Prime Minister. An administration may, at any time, seek a "vote of confidence"; conversely, a number of Members of Parilament may ask that a "vote of reproach" be taken. Both are rare occurrences with usually predictable outcomes as voting outside the party line happens very seldom.

On [[March 7]], [[2004]], [[Kostas Karamanlis]], president of the [[New Democracy]] party and nephew of the late [[Constantine Karamanlis]], was elected as the new [[Prime Minister of Greece]], thus marking his party's first electoral victory in nearly 11 years. Karamanlis managed to defeat ruling PASOK's newly elected candidate, [[George Papandreou]], son of the late [[Andreas Papandreou]]. [[Kostas Simitis]] was in office since [[January 1996]].

== Peripheries and prefectures ==
''Main article: [[Peripheries of Greece]], [[Prefectures of Greece]]''
[[Image:Greece.geohive.gif|left|thumb|400px|[[Subnational|Greek peripheries and prefectures]].]]

Greece consists of 13 administrative regions known as peripheries, which subdivide further into the 51 [[Prefectures of Greece|prefecture]]s (''nomoi'', singular - ''[[nomos]]''). For more detailed maps of the peripheries and/or prefectures, see the [[Peripheries of Greece]] page or [[Prefectures of Greece]] page.

Beyond these one autonomous region exists: [[Mount Athos]] (''Agio Oros'' - Holy Mountain), a monastic state under Greek sovereignty.

The 51 ''nomoi'' subdivide into 147 ''eparchies'' (singular ''eparchia''), which contain 1,033 [[Communities and Municipalities of Greece|municipalities and communities]]: 900 urban municipalities (''demoi'') and 133 rural communities (''koinotetes''). Before 1999, Greece's local government structure featured 5,775 local authorities: 457 ''demoi'' and  5,318 ''koinotetes'', subdivided into 12,817 localities (''oikismoi'').

[[Image:Greece-001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Greece from orbit]]
{{main|Geography of Greece}}
Greece consists of a large mainland at the southern end of the [[Balkans]]; the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] peninsula (separated from the mainland by the canal of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]); and [[Greek islands|numerous islands]] (around 3,000), including [[Crete]], [[Rhodes]], [[Kos]], [[Euboea]] and the [[Dodecanese]] and the [[Cyclades|Cycladic]] groups of the [[Aegean Sea]] as well as the [[Ionian Sea]] islands. Greece has more than 15,000 [[kilometre]]s (9,300&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of coastline and a land boundary of 1,160 kilometres (721&nbsp;mi). Approximately 27.9% of the nation's territory is covered by forests.[http://www.mongabay.com/deforestation_pcover.htm]

Four fifths of Greece consist of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most montainous in [[Europe]]. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and it is dominated by the [[Pindus]] mountain range. Pindus has a maximum elevation of 2,636 metres (8,648&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and it is essentially a prolongation of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The range continues through western Peloponnese, crosses the islands of [[Kythera]] and Antikythera and find its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of [[Crete]] where it eventually ends. (Actually the islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once consisted an extension of the mainland). Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. Most notably, the impressive [[Meteora]] formation consisting of high, steep boulders provides a breathtaking experience for the hundrends of thousands of tourists who visit the area each year. Special lifts transfer visitors to the scenic monasteries that lye on top of those rocks. Meteora are situated in the [[Trikala]] prefecture. The [[Vikos-Aoos Gorge]] is yet another spectacular formation and it is the second largest canyon on Earth, second only to the [[Grand Canyon]]. The Vicos-Aoos Gorge is a popular hotspot for those in fond of extreme sports. 

[[Mount Olympus]] is the tallest mountain in the country, located in the northern [[Pieria]] prefecture, near [[Thessaloniki]]. Mytikas in Olympus range has a height of 2,919 metres (9,570&nbsp;ft) at its tallest peak. Once considered the throne of the Gods, it is today extremely popular among hikers and climbers who deem its height as a challenge. Moreover, northeastern Greece features yet another high altitude mountain range, the Rhodope range, spreading across the prefectures of Eastern Macedonia and [[Thrace]]; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests including the famous Dadia.

Expansive plains are primarily located in the prefectures of [[Thessaly]], Central Macedonia and Thrace. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country. [[Volos]] and [[Larissa]] are the two largest cities of Thessaly.

Greece's [[climate]] consists of three types that influence well defined regions of its territory. Those are the Mediterranean, the Alpine and the Temperate types. The first one features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, Eastern Peloponessus and parts of the Sterea Ellada refion are mostly affected by this particular type. Temperatures rarely reach extreme values although snowfalls do occur occasionally even in the Cyclades or Crete during the winter months. The Alpine type is dominant mainly in Western Greece (Epirus, Central Greece, Thessaly, Western Macedonia as well as in the western and central parts of Peloponessus, including the prefectures of [[Achaea]], [[Arkadia]] and parts of [[Lakonia]], where the [[Pindus]] range passes by). Finally the Temperate type affects both Central and Eastern Macedonia as well as Thrace, mainly affecting the cities of [[Komotini]], [[Xanthi]] and the towns of northern [[Evros]]; it features cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers. [[Athens]] is located in a transitional area featuring both the Mediterranean and the Alpine types. The city's northern suburbs are dominated by the Alpine type while the downtown area and the southern suburbs enjoy a typical Meditteranean type.  

Rare marine species such as the [[Pinniped Seals]] and the [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]] live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endagered [[brown bear]] , the [[lynx]], the [[Roe Deer]] and the Wild Goat.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Greece}}

Greece has a mixed [[capitalist economy]] with the public sector accounting for a considerable, though declining part of the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. The Greek [[tourism]] industry remains thriving and its contribution in the GDP growth is considered important for foreign exchange earnings. Greece is a global leader in [[shipping]] (ranking first in terms of ownership of vessels and third by tonnage and flag registration) [http://www.marad.dot.gov/MARAD_statistics/Country-MFW-7-04.pdf]. Exports of manufactured goods including telecommunications hardware and software, agricultural products and other foodstuff and fuels account for a significant part of Greek income. 

The country is the largest investor in southeastern [[Europe]] as far as the previous sectors are concerned. After the end of the [[Greek Civil War]] in [[1949]] and for more than two decades Greece achieved the second highest economic growth rate in the world after [[Japan]], resulting in a dramatic improvement of living standards (the "[[Greek economic miracle]]"). Since Greece became a full member of the [[European Union]], on [[January 1]], [[1981]], it has benefited from cohesion funds, along with [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Ireland]]. Those funds have proven particularly helpful to the nation's economic development since the 1980s. Starting in [[1989]], Greece joined the ranks of (22 at that time) "[[developed countries]]".

[[Image:1e gre.png|left|thumb|170px|[[Greek euro coins]]]]
The country enjoys a high standard of living, ranking 24th on the [[2005]] [[Human Development Index]] and 22nd on [[The Economist]]'s 2005 world-wide quality-of-life index[http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf]. Average per capita income in 2005 was estimated at $22,800 [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gr.html] or 85% of the [[EU]] average in PPS (Purchasing Power Standards). Greek Economy has seen uninterrupted strong growth since [[1992]] and above the [[EU]] average continuously since [[1994]]. Part of the Greek economy's impressive growth is attributed to the fact that the previous government tightened fiscal policy regulations in the run-up to the country's entry into the [[Eurozone]], set on [[January 1]], [[2001]]([[Greek euro coins]]). Also liberalisation of domestic markets, a modernised banking system, as well as massive investment ahead of the [[2004 Olympic Games]], have fueled the economy even further. With the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, Greece has seen a huge influx of foreign labour force, mainly from neighbouring [[Albania]], but also from [[Pakistan]] and [[Eastern Europe]].

Today the country is dealing with various challenges, including the reduction of [[unemployment]] which currently stands at 9.7%, the reform of the social security system, the partial privatization of the [[public sector]], the overhauling of the tax system and the further reduction of bureaucratic inefficiencies. Forecasts predict that [[2006]] will be yet another year of substantial economic growth, estimated to reach 2.9%, which is above the European Union's average. The reduction of the [[fiscal deficit]] to the Eurozone target of 3% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] has also become a key issue. Shortly after its election, the new conservative [[New Democracy]] government revealed to the [[Eurostat]] agency that the previous figures supplied to it by the [[PASOK]] government as the basis of the Greek entry into the Eurozone were [[Greek Financial Audit, 2004|not correct]] (although even according to the "corrected" numbers, when calculated with the methodology still in force at the time of the Greek application for entry, the country had actually met the criteria for entry into the Eurozone). Under a negotiated agreement, the EU gave Greece a two year deadline (budgets of 2005 and 2006) in order to bring the deficit in line with the criteria of the [[European]] [[stability pact]]. In 2005, the new government managed to reduce the fiscal deficit by almost two percentage points and the goal of reaching the 3% target by the end of 2006 seems realistic.

The [[Bank of Greece]], now a subsidiary of the [[European Central Bank]], functions as the nation's central bank. This bank is not the same as the "[[National Bank of Greece]]", the country's largest commercial bank.

The [[2006]] Economic Agenda of the Greek government includes the privatization of several state owned companies as well as the creation of a new national airline that will replace [[Olympic Airlines]].

== Tourism ==
{{main|Tourism in Greece}}
Greece has traditionally been one of the most popular tourist destinations on a global basis and each year, particularly in the summer months, the nation's numerous cosmopolitan islands get crammed by millions of international visitors. Unparalleled natural beauties, golden beaches, idyllic sunsets, a legendary nightlife and the world famous [[Greek cuisine]] combined with a unique hospitality and an impressively developing tourism infrastracture make Greece an irresistible hotspot for many. The spectacular success of the [[2004 Olympic Games]] boosted the country's international prestige even further and reaffirmed its status as one of the safest places to be. In [[2004]], Greece ranked 12th in terms of international tourist arrivals when more than 14.2 million visitors came to the country, many of which combining both vacations and attendance of Olympic athletic events. In [[2005]], however, those numbers increased by 14%, surpassing 16.1 million arrivals. In [[2006]], those figures are only expected to grow bigger.

The [[New Democracy]] government, that took power in March 2004, established a brand new Ministry of Tourism headed by Mr. [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]]. Mr Avramopoulos proved to be a particularly competent man, determined to massively promote the nation to new, emerging markets in addition to the traditional ones, through various means of communication. For instance and among other initiatives, [[Helena Paparizou]], the winner of the [[2005 Eurovision Song Contest]] was designated as the official ambassador of the [http://www.gnto.gr  Hellenic Tourism Organization]. An interesting fact that is attributed to all those efforts is that according to a survey conducted in [[China]] in 2005, Greece was voted as Chinese' people number one choice. On [[February 14]], [[2006]], Ms Fani Palli- Petralia was appointed as the new minister of Tourism as a result of an extensive cabinet reshufle. Mr. Avramopoulos was appointed as the new Health Minister. 

Overall, this year the Greek Ministry of Tourism plans to invest more than 30 billion euros in the tourism industry, one of the most essential sectors of the Greek economy. That is 4 times more than the amount spent in 2002 by the previous government. What is more, the government intends to promote winter tourism in Greece, something that could potentially double international arrivals.

Apart from [[Athens]], other top ranking tourist destinations include the islands of [[Mykonos]], [[Santorini]], [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], [[Corfu]], [[Paros]], [[Ios]], [[Kos]], [[Kefallonia]], [[Zakynthos]] and [[Hydra]] as well as the northern [[Halkidiki]] peninsula.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Greece}}
The population of Greece is (officially) 98% Greek[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gr.html#People]  note: the Greek Government states there are no ethnic divisions in Greece[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gr.html#People], although Greece has various linguistic and cultural minorities. A non-comprehensive list of these would include [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Macedonian Slavs]], [[Pomaks]], and various [[Roma (people)|Roma]] groups. A number of religious minorities exist, including the [[Greek Muslim minority|Muslim minority]] in [[Western Thrace|western Thrace]], which makes up about a third of that region's population.

About 60-65% of Greek immigrants have come from [[Albania]] (following the fall of communism) although some 200.000 have been documented as ethnic [[Greeks]] or ''homogeneis''. The other principal [[nationalities]] are, according to residence permit data, [[Bulgarians]], [[Armenians]], [[Romanians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Pakistanis]] and [[Georgians]]; overall, over 180 different nationalities have been recorded. The legal status of immigrants has been very tenuous since the 1990s (as throughout [[the European Union]]), with high levels of illegality. Since 1997 three legalization programmes were enacted by the Greek state [a fourth went through in 2005].

Several prominent Greek sportsmen migrated to Greece as ethnic Greeks from [[Albania]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the 1990s, including legendary [[weightlifter]]s [[Pyrros Dimas]] and [[Kakhi Kakhiashvili]].

=== Religion ===
The majority of Greeks (95-98%) have at least nominal membership in the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]]. Greek [[Muslim]]s make up about 1.3% of the population, and live primarily in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. Greece also has some [[Roman Catholic]]s, mainly in the city of [[Patras]], [[Corfu]], and the [[Cyclades]] islands of [[Syros]], [[Paros]], [[Tinos]], and [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]]; some [[Protestant]]s and some [[Jew]]s, mainly in [[Thessaloniki]] (which was once a major Jewish city until the [[Holocaust]]). Some groups in Greece have started an attempt to reconstruct [[Hellenic polytheism]], the ancient Greek [[paganism|pagan]] religion. See also: [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]].

Prior to Ottoman rule, Greece was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The civil and religious capital of the Empire was moved to  [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]]. Since Constantine’s time the Orthodox Christian faith has flourished and spread throughout Eastern Europe. Even under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule and repeated attempts at prosletization - firstly by the [[Jesuits]] and then by the Protestants - [[Orthodox Christianity]] survived and flourished. 

The role of the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Church]] in maintaining Greek ethnic and cultural identity during the 400 years of Ottoman rule, strengthened the bond between religion and the state. Most Greeks, even many non-practicing Christians, revere and respect the Orthodox Christian faith; even the majority of non-beliving, secular Greeks feel culturally attached to their Church. Most Greeks attend Church during the Major Feast days, and are emotionally attached to [[Orthodox Christianity]] as their 'national' religion. 

The [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]] reflects this relationship by guaranteeing absolute freedom of religion while still defining the "prevailing religion" of Greece as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christ. In practice, the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Church]] and the secular state are intimately involved with one another in certain areas.  Joint approval is needed for the building of churches and the Church has even blocked the building of places of worship for other religions in [[Athens]].  Priests receive state salaries.  The President of the Republic takes an oath on the [[Bible]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]] is given privileged place in religious studies in primary education. Non Greek Orthodox members of parliament are sworn in accordance to their own faith. The Church has also been allowed to keep its large portfolio of financial assets exempt from taxation and fiscal auditing. 

Starting in January 2005, a series of highly publicised corruption scandals involving high rank church officials have led to many calls by secular Greeks for the complete separation of Church and State and greater control of Church assets. 

One small part of Greece, [[Mount Athos]], is recognised by the Greek constitution as an autonomous monastic republic, although foreign relations remain the prerogative of the Greek state.

Spiritually, Mount Athos is under the Patriarchate of Constantinople and is therefore in communion with all the monasteries on Mount Athos and with the Orthodox Church based in various countries. One monastery has recently broken away and has formed a completely independent schism on the Holy Mountain -- [[Esphygmenou Monastery]]. Esphygmenou is composed of 117 [[Zealot]] monks who stubbornly oppose the head of the Church and do not commemorate him any more. They believe that they are the last remaining true Christians in the world and that Orthodoxy has been corrupted by having dialogue with other faiths.  They also object to the lifting of the anathemas against the Roman Catholic Church in the 1960's by Patriarch [[Athenagoras]].

[[Jew]]s have been present in Greece for the last 2,000 years. The earliest reference to a Greek Jew is in an inscription, dated circa 300-250 BC found in Oropos, a small coastal town between [[Athens]] and [[Boeotia]], and refers to him as "Moschos, son of Moschion the Jew" who was in all likelihood, a slave. The first Greek Jewish population became known as the [[Romaniotes]] and their language became known as [[Yevanic language|Yevanic]] (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for Greece: יון/Yavan). From the 16th century onwards, [[Salonica]], a city in northern Greece, had one of the largest (mostly [[Sephardic]] by then) Jewish communities in the world and a solid rabbinical tradition. On the island of [[Crete]], the Jews played an important part in the transport trade. During [[World War II]], when Greece was occupied by [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]], 86% of the Greek Jews were murdered by the invading Axis and only a minority survived and most of them have emigrated to [[Israel]]. Greece's Jewish community today is estimated at 4,500.

According to the most recent Eurostat "Eurobarometer" poll, in 2005 <ref name="Eurostat poll on the social and religious beliefs of Europeans"> Eurobarometer, http://europa.eu.int/comm/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf</ref>, 81% of Greek citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 16% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and only 3% that "they do not believe there is a God, spirit, nor life force". This would make Greece one of the most religious countries in the European Union of 25 members, after Malta and Cyprus.
