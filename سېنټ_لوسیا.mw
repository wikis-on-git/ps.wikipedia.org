'''Saint Lucia''' is an [[island nation]] in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on the boundary with the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], it is located north of the islands of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and south of [[Martinique]]. It is also known as the "Helen of the West".

== History ==
{{main|History of Saint Lucia}}

Saint Lucia is an independent island nation and one of the [[Windward Islands]]. Named for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucy of Syracuse]]. It was first visited by Europeans in about the year [[1500]] and first colonized successfully by [[France]] who signed a treaty with the native [[Carib]] peoples in [[1660]]. [[Great Britain]] then took control of the island from [[1663]]-[[1667]] before going to war with France over it fourteen times. The British finally took complete control of the island in [[1814]]. Representative government came about in [[1924]] and from [[1958]] to [[1962]] the island was a member of The [[West Indies Federation|Federation of the West Indies]]. Lastly, on [[February 22]], [[1979]] Saint Lucia became an independent state of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Saint Lucia}}

As a [[Commonwealth Realm]], Saint Lucia recognizes [[Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as the [[Head of State]] of Saint Lucia, represented on the island by a [[Governor-General]]. [[executive branch|Executive power]], however, is in the hands of the [[prime minister]] and his [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. The prime minister is normally the head of the party winning the elections for the [[House of Assembly of Saint Lucia|House of Assembly]], which has 17  seats. The other chamber of [[parliament]], the [[Senate]], has 11 appointed members.

Saint Lucia is a full & participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

== Quarters ==
{{main|Quarters of Saint Lucia}}

The island of Saint Lucia is divided into 11 quarters:

* [[Anse-la-Raye]]
* [[Castries]]
* [[Choiseul Quarter|Choiseul]]
* [[Dauphin Quarter|Dauphin]]
* [[Dennery]]
* [[Gros Islet]]
* [[Laborie]]
* [[Micoud]]
* [[Praslin Quarter|Praslin]]
* [[Soufrière Quarter|Soufrière]]
* [[Vieux Fort]]

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Saint Lucia geography map en.png|thumb|Map of Saint Lucia]]
{{main|Geography of Saint Lucia}}

The [[volcano|volcanic]] island of Saint Lucia is more mountainous than many other [[Caribbean]] islands, with the highest point being [[Mount Gimie]], at 950 m above sea level. Two other mountains, the [[Pitons]], form the island's most famous landmark. They are located between [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] and [[Choiseul, Saint Lucia|Choiseul]] on the western side of the island. Saint Lucia is also one of the few islands in the world that flaunts a drive-in volcano.

The capital city of Saint Lucia is [[Castries]], where about one third of the population lives. Major towns include [[Gros Islet]], Soufrière and [[Vieux Fort]]. The local [[climate]] is tropical, moderated by northeast trade winds, with a dry season from January to April and a rainy season from May to November.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Saint Lucia}}

The recent changes in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from [[Latin America]]n [[banana]]s have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia. The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and [[tourism]] industries, which is the island's main source of revenue. The [[manufacturing]] sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry. Despite negative growth in [[2001]], economic fundamentals remain solid, and [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth should recover in the future.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Saint Lucia}}

The small population of Saint Lucia is of mostly African descent (upwards of 90% of the population).There is also a small but economically significant mulatto minority representing approximately 5%; just 1.1% are of [[Europe]]an origin, with an [[Indo-Caribbean]] minority of some 3%. A small, mixed Carib (Kalinago) population mainly centered in the Choiseul region, but also in other towns on the Western coast, is present as well. Rounding out the population are small numbers of Lebanese and Syrians. The official language of the country is [[English language|English]], but a [[patois]] based mainly on [[French language|French]] is also spoken. The majority of the population are [[Roman Catholic]]s (ca. 90%); the rest are [[Anglican]]s (3%) or other [[Protestant]]s (7%).

St. Lucia boasts the highest ratio in the world for number of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates produced with respect to the total population of the nation. Two winners have come from St. Lucia - [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Sir Arthur Lewis]] won the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] ("Nobel Prize in Economics") in [[1979]], and [[Derek Walcott]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in [[1992]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Saint Lucia}}

* [[Derek Walcott]]
* [[Music of Saint Lucia]]

The culture of Saint Lucia is rich in history. The culture is been influenced by African, French and English heritage. One of the secondary languages is [[Antillean Creole|Kreole]], a form of [[French language|French]] [[Patois]].

;Festivals
Saint Lucian cultural festivals include La Rose and La Marguerite, the one representing the [[Rosecrucian]] order, the other one representing [[Freemasonry]], which can be clearly seen on a mural painted by Dunstan St.Omer, depicting the holy [[trinity]] of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]] and [[Isis]] 

Traditionally, in common with other Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia held a [[carnival]] before [[Lent]]. In [[1999]], it was moved to mid-July in order to not to coincide with the much larger [[Trinidad and Tobago carnival]], so as to attract more overseas visitors.

;Music and dance
A popular folk dance is the [[Quadrille]]

As well as other Caribbean music genres such as [[Soca]], [[Zouk]] and [[Reggae]], Saint Lucia has a strong indigenous folk music tradition.

Each May since [[1992]], Saint Lucia has hosted an internationally-renowned [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival|Jazz Festival]].

== Tourism in St Lucia ==
Second only to [[banana]]s, [[tourism]] is vital to St Lucia's economy - and it is hard to imagine that tourism will not become even more important in the future.  Provided one visits during the dry season (January - April), St Lucia has all the ingredients necessary for a great holiday in the sun: warm temperatures, breath taking scenery, gorgeous beaches, crystal-clear waters and friendly natives.

But St Lucia also has character: there is more to see than just the beaches. In the south there is the "World's only drive-in Volcano" which is a great day out (the smell notwithstanding) as is the wonderful [[St Lucia Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]]. In the north there is Pigeon Island National Park, with the ruins of an old British base (Fort Rodney) once commanded by Admiral Rodney to which the area Rodney Bay is named after. The fact that the island is not over-developed is also a plus-point: there are lovely beaches without hotels, sweeping mountains and impenetrable [[rain forest]]s.
