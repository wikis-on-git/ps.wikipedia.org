'''Mali''', officially the '''Republic of Mali''' ([[French language|French]]: ''République du Mali'', [[Amazigh]]: [[Image:Mali_tifinagh.JPG]]), is a [[landlocked]] nation in [[West Africa|Western Africa]]. It is the second largest country among West African nations.  It borders [[الجېريا]] on the north, [[نايجېر]] on the east, [[بورکينا فاسو]] and the [[عاج ساحل]] on the south, [[ګونې]] on the south-west, and [[سېنېګال]] and [[ماوريتانيا]] on the west. Its straight borders on the north stretch into the centre of the [[Sahara]] desert, while the country's south, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the [[Niger river|Niger]] and [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers. Formerly [[French Sudan]], the country is named after the [[Empire of Mali]].  The name of the country comes from the [[Bambara language|Bambara]] word for [[hippopotamus]] and the animal appears on the Mali 5 franc coin.

==تاريخ==
{{main|History of Mali}}
<!--The empire of ancient Mali, located in western Africa, stretched across the [[Sahel]] and the Sahara Desert.  The country remains land-locked, with desert regions in the north and [[savanna]] in the south.  Southern Mali is wetter, and natural vegetation is increasingly abundant, while northern Mali is arid and desert.  The hot, dry winds that blow from the northeast are known as ''[[harmattan]]''.

The empire is located astride one of the world's most lucrative trade routes.  The Niger River supplied the people with water for domestic and agricultural uses, and was also the "highway" for trade. They earned a lot of their money from the salt and gold trading. Camels carried salt from the north mines to be traded for gold, kola nuts, and grain in southern Mali. -->

The [[Mandé]] peoples settled the [[Sahel]] (including present-day Mali), and formed a succession of [[Sahelian kingdom]]s, including the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], and the [[Songhai Empire]]. [[Timbuktu]] was a key city in these empires as an outpost for [[trans-Saharan trade]] and a center for scholarship. The Songhai Empire declined under a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] invasion in [[1591]].

Mali was invaded by [[France]] starting in 1880, which annexed it as an overseas department of France. The colony, which at times also included neighbouring countries, was known as [[French Sudan]] or the Sudanese Republic. In early 1959, the union of Mali and [[Senegal]] became the [[Mali Federation]], which gained independence from France on [[June 20]], [[1960]]. Senegal withdrew from the Mali Federation after a few months. The '''Republic of Mali''', under [[Modibo Keïta]], withdrew from the [[French Community]] on [[September 22]], [[1960]].

Modibo Keita was victim of a coup in 1968 after which Mali was ruled by Moussa Traoré until [[1991]]. Anti-government protests in [[1991]] led to a coup, a transitional government, and a new constitution. In [[1992]], [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]] won Mali's first democratic, multi-party presidential election. Upon his reelection in [[1997]], President Konaré pushed through political and economic reforms and fought corruption. In [[2002]] he was succeeded in democratic elections by [[Amadou Toumani Touré]], a retired General, who had been the leader of the military aspect of [[1991]] democratic uprising.

{{morepolitics|country=Mali}}
Under Mali's 1992 constitution, a [[president]] is elected for a five year term as chief of state and commander in chief of the armed forces.  This president appoints the prime minister and chairs the Council of Ministers, which adopts proposals for laws submitted to the National Assembly for approval.  The constitution further defines Mali as being a multi-party democracy, and prohibits parties based on ethnic, religious, regional, or gender lines.  

The National Assembly is the sole legislative arm of the government, and currently consists of 147 members.  The term of office for members is five years.  Eight political parties are currently represented in the Assembly, and are aggregated into four parliamentary groups.  ADEMA currently holds the majority among these groups.    

Mali is divided into eight administrative regions, which are themselves further divided into districts.  These districts are composed of communes, which contain villages.  Since decentralization plans began, a total of 702 local municipal councils have been formed.  These are headed by elected mayors.

The Malian legal system is largely defined by the country's former colonial status under France.  Moves have been made to change this system to closer conform to the actual culture of the country, but many laws of the French era remain in effect.  The judiciary is defined by the constitution as being an independent body.  Currently, judges are appointed by the Ministry of Justice.  Mali has both a constitutional court, and a high court of justice.  The latter is empowered to try government officials in cases of treason.

{{main|Geography of Mali}}

Mali is [[landlocked]] and has a [[subtropical]] to [[arid]] climate.  It is mostly flat, rising to rolling northern plains covered by [[sand]], with [[savanna]] around the [[Niger River]] in the south.  The hills of the [[Air Massif]] and [[Djado Plateau]] lie in the northeast.  Most of the country lies in the [[Sahara Desert]], which produces a hot, dust-laden [[harmattan]] haze common during dry seasons and leads to recurring [[drought]]s.  The nation has considerable natural resources, with [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[phosphates]], [[kaolinite]], [[salt]] and [[limestone]] being most widely exploited.

{{main|Economy of Mali}}

Mali is among the poorest countries in the world, with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the [[Niger River]]. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Pottery is also practised by women whose wares are bought by dealers and are transported to markets where they are sold by traders. The traditional methods used by the potters are an attraction to foreign tourists. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main export. In [[1997]], the government continued its successful implementation of an [[IMF]]-recommended [[structural adjustment]] program that is helping the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's adherence to economic reform, and the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January [[1994]], has pushed up economic growth. Several multinational corporations increased gold mining operations in [[1996]]-[[1998]], and the government anticipates that Mali will become a major Sub-Saharan gold exporter in the next few years.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Mali}}

Mali's population consists of diverse Sub-Saharan ethnic groups, sharing similar historic, cultural, and religious traditions. Exceptions are the Tuaregs and Maurs, desert nomads, related to the North African Berbers. The Tuaregs traditionally have opposed the central government. Starting in June 1990 in the north, Tuaregs seeking greater autonomy led to clashes with the military. In April 1992, the government and most opposing factions signed a pact to end the fighting and restore stability in the north. Its major aims are to allow greater autonomy to the north and increase government resource allocation to what has been a traditionally impoverished region. The peace agreement was celebrated in 1996 in Timbuktu during an official and highly publicized ceremony called "Flamme de la Paix"--(peace flame).

{{main|Culture of Mali}}

Approximately 90% of Malians follow [[Sunni Islam]], but not always to the exclusion of traditional religious beliefs and practices. Muslims have their own educational systems, leading in some cases to the equivalent of baccalaureate and doctoral studies. An increasingly large number of Muslims make the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and study in Arab countries. Christians comprise about 5% of the population. Under French colonial rule the introduction of missionaries into predominantly Islamic areas was discouraged.

Literacy in French, the official language, is low and is concentrated in the urban areas. The government has expanded literacy considerably since 1960 by stressing education at the primary and lower secondary levels. A national university was established in [[Bamako]] in the 1990s.
