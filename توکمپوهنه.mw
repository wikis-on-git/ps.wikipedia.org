'''Ethnology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ethnos'', meaning "people") is the branch of [[anthropology]] that compares and analyses the origins, distribution, technology, religion, language, and social structure of the [[race|racial]] or [[nation]]al divisions of humanity.<ref>{{cite book |last= Newman|first= Garfield, et al|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Echoes from the past: world history to the 16th century|year= 2001|publisher= McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd|location= Toronto|isbn= 0-07-088739-X}}</ref> Compared to [[ethnography]], the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.

Among its goals are the reconstruction of [[human history]], and the formulation of [[culture|cultural]] [[universal (metaphysics)|invariants]], such as the alleged [[incest taboo]] and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "[[human nature]]", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[structuralism]], etc.). 

In some parts of the world (like the USA and Great Britain) it is also referred to as cultural or social anthropology, however ethnology is not only a single part of cultural anthropology.  Ethnology has been considered as a [[science|scientific]] discipline since the late 18th century but can be generally applied to any comparative study of human groups. 

The 15th century "discovery of America" had an important role in the new [[Occident]]al interest toward the [[Other]], often qualified as "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian or as a "[[noble savage]]". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a [[dualism|dualist]] manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly-shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (philosophy)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.

Lévi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[anthropophagy]] as an early example of "ethnology". Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralist|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, which he thought was the prohibition of the [[incest taboo|incest]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th and 20th century social thinkers, among the more important include: [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Foucault]], [[Althusser]] and [[Deleuze]].
