==References by other artists and in popular culture==

In 1996, during [[1996–1997 protests in Serbia|massive opposition street protests]] in [[Belgrade]], Serbia, "Fuck tha Police", along with [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s "[[Fight the Power]]" was continually played for 2 days on a Belgrade American-funded radio station [[B92]].

[[Kanye West]] alludes to the song in his single "[[All Falls Down]]", "I say 'fuck the police', that's how I treat 'em".  "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]", a song by [[Ice-T]]'s metal band [[Body Count]], also contains the lyrics "fuck the police", as does "Still No Surrender" by [[Bone Thugs N Harmony]].

[[Game (rapper) | The Game]] references the song in his song, Doctor's Advocate [[Doctor's Advocate | off the album of the same name]], expressing his shame of leaving [[Aftermath Entertainment | Aftermath]] and going into beef with fellow rapper and former labelmate at the time [[50 Cent]]:
"I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef, But you told me it was okay to say "Fuck The Police."

[[Chris Rock]] specifically refers to the song in his skit from ''[[The Chris Rock Show]]'', ''How to not get your ass Kicked by the Police'': "If you're listening to loud rap music ...turn that shit off! Blastin' "Fuck tha Police" while you're getting pulled over by the police is just ign'ant."

In 2007, English comedian [[Adam Buxton]] performed a 'cleaned up' version of the song, entitled 'Help the Police', as part of the BBC3 sketch show Rush Hour.

In 2008, [[Lil Wayne]]'s hit single "[[Mrs. Officer]]" specifically referenced "Fuck tha Police," but in a much more literal sense (i.e., having sex with the police). 

The song and group were parodied in the 1994 hip-hop [[mockumentary]] [[film]] ''[[Fear of a Black Hat]]'' and its soundtrack album, as a single for the fictional gangsta-rap group N.W.H. (Niggaz With Hats) as "Fuck the Security Guards."

==Cover versions==

This song has proven popular enough to be covered by such acts as [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]], and their version was later added to the 20th anniversary edition of ''Straight Outta Compton'' [http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/music/urban-grooves/straight-outta-compton-20th-anniversary-edition/287431]. It has also gained popularity with metal bands, including [[Dope (band)|Dope]]. [http://www.metrolyrics.com/fuck-tha-police-2005-studio-version-lyrics-dope.html] It has also been covered by [[Rage Against The Machine]].

In 2009, [[Suburban Noize Records]] released a cover of the song by rappers Judge D, [[Saint Dog]], and [[Daddy X]] on the mixtape ''[[Blast from the Past (SubNoize Souljaz album)|Blast from the Past]]''.
