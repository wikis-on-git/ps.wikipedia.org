'''Qatar''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: قطر [[IPA|{{IPA|/ˈqɑ̱.tˁɑ̱r/}}]]<ref>The pronunciation of ''Qatar'' in [[English language|English]] varies; see [[list of words of disputed pronunciation]] for details. In terms of English phonemics, the vowels sound halfway between short ''u'' [[IPA|/ʌ/]] and broad ''a'' [[IPA|/ɑ/]]. The ''q'' and the ''t'' have no direct counterparts, but are closest to the unaspirated allophones of English ''k'' and ''t''. However, since these allophones can not occur in these positions in English, in this context they will sound more like English ''g'' and ''d''. So the closest pronunciation, according to English phonemics, to the original Arabic is [[IPA|/ˈɡɑd.ɚ/]] or [[IPA|/ˈɡʌd.ɚ/]]. Note that English phonemics necessitate the weakening of the unstressed vowel to [[IPA|/ə/]].</ref>), officially the '''State of Qatar''' (Arabic: دولة قطر, ''Dawlat Qatar''), is an [[emirate]] in the [[Middle East]] or [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]], occupying the small [[Qatar Peninsula]] on the northeasterly coast of the larger [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is  bordered by [[سعودي عربستان]] to the south; otherwise the [[Persian Gulf]] surrounds the [[state]].

==History==
{{main|History of Qatar}}

Qatar forms one of the newer emirates in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. After domination by [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s for thousands of years and more recently by the [[Ottoman Turks]], and by the [[United Kingdom|British]], Qatar became an independent [[state]] on [[September 3]], [[1971]]. Unlike most nearby emirates, Qatar declined to become part of either the [[United Arab Emirates]] or of Saudi Arabia.

Although the peninsular land mass that makes up Qatar has sustained humans for thousands of years, for the bulk of its history the arid climate fostered only short-term settlements by nomadic tribes. Clans such as the [[Al Khalifa]] and the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] (which would later ascend the thrones of Bahrain and of Saudi Arabia respectively) swept through the Arabian peninsula and camped on the coasts within small fishing and pearling villages. The clans battled each other for lucrative oyster beds and lands, frequently forming and breaking coalitions with one another in their attempts to establish  territorial supremacy.
[[Image:Desert_Qatar.JPG|left|thumbnail|Qatari desert]]
The British initially sought out Qatar and the Persian Gulf as an intermediary vantage point ''en route'' to their colonial interests in [[India]], although the discovery of [[Petroleum|oil]] and hydrocarbons in the early twentieth century would re-invigorate their interest. During the nineteenth century (the time of Britain’s formative ventures into the region) the [[Al Khalifa]] clan reigned over the Northern Qatari peninsula from the off-shore island of Bahrain to the west. Although Qatar legally had the status of a dependency, resentment festered against the Bahraini Al Khalifas along the eastern seaboard in the fishing villages of Doha and Wakrah. In 1867 the Al Khalifas launched a successful effort to quash the Qatari rebels by sending a massive naval force to Wakrah. Bahraini aggression however violated an 1820 Anglo-Bahraini Treaty, and the diplomatic response of the British Protectorate set into motion the political forces that would eventuate in the founding of the state of Qatar. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, the British Protectorate (per Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]]) asked to negotiate with a representative  from Qatar. The request carried with it a tacit recognition of Qatar’s status as distinct from Bahrain. To negotiate with Colonel Pelly the Qataris chose a respected entrepreneur and long-time resident of [[Doha]], [[Muhammed bin Thani]]. His clan, the [[Al Thani]]s, had taken relatively little part in Persian Gulf politics, but the diplomatic foray ensured their future participation and dominion as the ruling family, a dynasty that continues to this day. The negotiation results left Qatar with a new-found sense of political selfhood, although it did not gain official standing as a British [[protectorate]] until 1916.

The imperial reach of the [[British Empire]] diminished after the [[Second World War]], more so after India became independent in 1947. Momentum for a British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf Arab emirates increased during the 1950s, and the British welcomed [[Kuwait]]'s declaration of independence in 1961.  Seven years later, when  Britain officially announced that it would disengage (politically, not economically) from the Persian Gulf in three years time, Qatar joined Bahrain and seven other [[Trucial States]] in a federation. Regional disputes however quickly compelled Qatar to resign and declare independence from the coalition that would evolve into the seven-[[imarat]] [[United Arab Emirates]]. Thus 1971 marked the inauguration of Qatar as an independent sovereign state.

[[As of 2005|Since 1995]], Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]] has ruled Qatar: he seized control of the country from his father [[Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani]] while the latter vacationed in [[Switzerland]]. Under Emir Hamad, Qatar has experienced a notable amount of sociopolitical liberalization, including the enfranchisement of women, a new constitution, and the launch of [[Al Jazeera]], the controversial Arabic language [[satellite television]] news channel. Qatar ranks as the 11th richest country in the world per-capita [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita].

Qatar served as the headquarters and one of the main launching sites of the [[US invasion of Iraq]] [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5437.htm] in 2003.

In 2005 a suicide-bombing that killed a British teacher at the Doha Players Theatre shocked the country, which had not previously experienced acts of terrorism. It is not clear that the bombing was from organized terrorist sources, and although the investigation is ongoing there are indications that the attack was the work of an individual, not a group.

The [[United States Armed Forces]] [[Unified Combatant Command]] unit for the [[Middle East]] [[theater (military)|theater]], known as [[United States Central Command|CENTCOM]] (US Central Command), has its headquarters in Qatar. Qatar also hosts a large [[United States Air Force]] base.  

Qatar held the West Asian Games in 2005. Qatar will host the fifteenth [[Asian Games]] in December 2006.

==Politics==
[[Image:Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]], Emir of Qatar]]
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Qatar}}
According to the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] standards, the Qatari authorities seem to keep a relatively tight rein on freedom of expression and moves for equality.

In Qatar, the ruling Al Thani (آل ثاني) family continued to hold power following the declaration of independence in 1971. The Emir functions as head of state, and the right to rule Qatar resides within the Al Thani family. Politically, Qatar has started to evolve from a traditional society in the direction of a modern welfare state. In order to meet the requirements of social and economic progress, the authorities have established Government departments. 

The Basic Law of Qatar (1970) institutionalized local customs rooted in Qatar's conservative [[Wahhabi]] heritage, granting the Emir pre-eminent power. Continuing traditions of consultation, rule by consensus, and the citizen's right to appeal personally to the Emir all influence the Emir's role. The Emir, while directly accountable to no one, cannot violate the [[Sharia | Shari’a]] (Islamic law) and, in practice, must consider the opinions of leading notables and of the religious establishment. The Advisory Council, an appointed body that assists the Emir in formulating policy, has institutionalized the position of such influential groups. Qatar has no electoral system, and imposes a ban on political parties.

The influx of expatriate Arabs has introduced ideas that call into question the tenets of Qatar's traditional society, but no serious challenge to Al Thani rule has emerged.

In February 1972, the Deputy Ruler and Prime Minister, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad, deposed his cousin, Emir Ahmad, and assumed power. The key members of Al Thani supported this move, which took place without violence or signs of political unrest.

On [[June 27]], [[1995]], the Deputy Ruler, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, deposed his father Emir Khalifa in a bloodless coup. Emir Hamad and his father reconciled in 1996. Increased freedom of the press followed, and the Qatar-based [[Al Jazeera]] television channel (founded in late 1996) has acquired a unique reputation as a free and uncensored source of news in [[Arab World|Arab countries]].

According to BBC, in April 2006 Qatar announced that it will give $50m USD (£ 28m) to the new [[Hamas]]-led [[Palestine|Palestinian]] government.   Many Western countries have cut off financial support to Palestine since its election of a Hamas-led government.

In May 2006, Qatar pledged more than $100 million to [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief to colleges and universities in [[Louisiana]] affected by the hurricane.

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Municipalities of Qatar}}
Qatar is divided into ten ''[[municipality|municipalities]]'' (Arabic: ''[[baladiyah]]''), also occasionally translated as ''[[governorates]]'' or ''[[provinces]]'':

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Qatar}}
[[Image:Modern Doha.jpg|left|thumbnail|200px|Qatar's great wealth is most visible in its capital, Doha.]]
Before the discovery of oil the economy of the Qatari region focused on [[fishing]] and [[pearling]]. After the introduction of the [[Japan]]ese cultured pearl onto the world market in the 1920s and 1930s, Qatar's pearling industry faltered. However, the discovery of [[oil reserves]], beginning in the 1940s, completely transformed the nation's economy. Now, the country has a high [[standard of living]], with many social services offered to its citizens and all the amenities of any modern nation.

Qatar's national income primarily derives from oil and [[natural gas]] exports. The country has oil reserves estimated at 15 billion barrels (2.4 km³). Qataris' [[wealth]] and [[standard of living]] compare well with those of [[Western Europe]]an nations. Qatar has the highest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita in the developing world ($47,518 [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2005&ED=2005&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=512-941-914-446-612-666-614-672-311-946-213-137-911-962-193-674-122-676-912-548-313-556-419-678-513-181-316-682-913-684-124-273-339-921-638-948-514-686-218-688-963-518-616-728-223-558-516-138-918-353-748-196-618-278-522-692-622-694-156-142-624-449-626-564-628-283-228-853-924-288-233-293-632-566-636-964-634-182-238-453-662-968-960-922-423-714-935-862-128-716-611-456-321-722-243-965-248-718-469-724-253-576-642-936-643-961-939-813-644-199-819-184-172-524-132-361-646-362-648-364-915-732-134-366-652-734-174-144-328-146-258-463-656-528-654-923-336-738-263-578-268-537-532-742-944-866-176-369-534-744-536-186-429-925-178-746-436-926-136-466-343-112-158-111-439-298-916-927-664-846-826-299-542-582-443-474-917-754-544-698&S=NGDPDPC&CMP=0&x=14&y=10] as of 2005). Qatar is also one of the two least taxed sovereign states in the world with no income tax[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=46672] (The other is [[Bahrain]]).

While oil and gas will probably remain the backbone of Qatar's economy for some time to come, the country seeks to stimulate the private sector and develop a "[[knowledge economy]]". In 2004 it established the [[Qatar Science & Technology Park]] to attract and serve technology-based companies and entrepreneurs, from overseas and within Qatar.

==Geography==
[[Image:Qa-map.PNG|right|thumbnail|Map of Qatar]]
{{main|Geography of Qatar}}

The Qatari [[peninsula]] juts 100 miles<!--Format per WP:MOSNUM--> (160 km) into the [[Persian Gulf]] from Saudi Arabia. Much of the country consists of a low, barren plain, covered with sand. To the southeast lies the spectacular Khor al Adaid or 'Inland Sea', an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an inlet of the Gulf.

The highest point in Qatar occurs in the Jebel Dukhan to the west, a range of low limestone outcrops running north-south from Zikrit through [[Umm Bab]] to the southern border, and reaching about 295 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (90 m) [[Above mean sea level|ASL]]. This area also contains Qatar's main onshore oil deposits, while the natural gas fields lie offshore, to the northwest of the peninsula.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Qatar}}

Nearly all Qataris profess [[Islam]]. Besides ethnic [[Arab]]s, much of the population migrated from various nations to work in the country's oil industry. Arabic serves as the official language, but many residents understand [[English language|English]].

[[Expatriate]]s form the majority of Qatar's residents. The petrochemical industry has attracted people from all around the world. Most of the expatriates come from [[South Asia]] and from surrounding non-oil-rich Arab nations. Because the expatriates are overwhelmingly male, Qatar has the most heavily skewed sex ratio in the world, with 1.88 males per female (as of 2006, source: [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2018.html CIA Factbook]). This is true to a lesser extent in the other Gulf Arab countries as well.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Qatar}}
[[Image:Al Khor Beach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Beach in Qatar]]
Qatar explicitly uses [[Wahhabi]] law as the basis of its government, and the vast majority of its citizens follow this specific Islamic doctrine. [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] founded Wahhabism, a puritanical version of Islam which takes a literal interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]]. In the eighteenth century, Abd Al-Wahhab formed a compact with the al-Saud family, the founders of Saudi Arabia.

In the early twentieth century, when the Al-Thanis realized that converting to the doctrine of their larger neighbor might bode well for the survival of their régime, they imported Wahhabi Islam from Saudi Arabia to Qatar. Perhaps as an effect of the importation, Wahhabism takes a less strict form in Qatar than in Saudi Arabia, though it still governs a large portion of Qatari mores and rituals. For example, almost all Qatari women wear the black [[abaya]] (also donned in Saudi Arabia) - however, the government of Qatar does not universally impose the style on foreigners, or Qatari females. The [[abaya]] is mainly passed down from generation to generation and is still present because of the traditional values of the country.
{{See|Music of Qatar}}

==Qatari law==
When contrasted with other [[Arab]] states such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, Qatar has comparatively liberal laws. Women can drive in Qatar, whereas they may not legally drive in Saudi Arabia. 

The country has undergone a period of liberalization and modernization after the current Emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, came to power after overthrowing his father. For example, women can dress mostly as they please in public (although in practice local Qatari women generally don the black abaya). Before the liberalization, it was taboo for men to wear shorts in public. The laws of Qatar tolerate [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] to a certain extent. However, public bars in Qatar operate only in expensive hotels (whereas the emirates of [[Dubai]] and [[Bahrain]] allow the establishment of nightclubs and other venues). A further liberalization may take place in order to accommodate the 15th [[Asian Games]] in 2006.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Qatar}}
[[Image:Weill Medical College Qatar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Weill Medical College|Weill Medical College's]] international campus in Qatar]]
In recent years Qatar has placed great emphasis on education. Along with the country’s free healthcare to every citizen, every child has free education from kindergarten through [[college]]. The country has a university, the [[University of Qatar]], and a number of higher educational institutions. Additionally, with the support of the [[Qatar Foundation]],  major [[United States|American]] universities have opened branch campuses in [[Education City, Qatar]]. These include [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Texas A&M University]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and [[Cornell University]]'s [[Weill Cornell Medical College|Weill Medical College]]. In 2004 Qatar established the [[Qatar Science & Technology Park]] at Education City to link those universities with industry. 

In November of 2002 the Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani created the [http://www.english.education.gov.qa/section/sec/ Supreme Education Council]. The Council directs and controls education for all ages from the pre-school level through the university level, including the [http://www.english.education.gov.qa/ "Education for a New Era"] reform initiative.

The Emir's second wife, [[Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned]], has been instrumental in new education initiatives in Qatar. She chairs the Qatar Foundation and is on the board of Qatar's Supreme Education Council
