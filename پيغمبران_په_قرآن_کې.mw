This is such an unjust and grave claim that "At it the skies are about to burst, and the earth split asunder, and the mountains to crumble down crashing, that they have attributed to the Most Gracious a son! It is not befitting for the Most Gracious to beget a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the Most Gracious as a slave" 19:90-93. The claim of those who attribute such fallacy to Him is refuted in these verses.

== محمد ==
{{آرنی|محمد}}
Muhammed ibn Abdullah(53 B.H-11 A.H; 571-632 AD) is the most revered and Last Prophet in Islam. According to Islamic tradition Muhammad never claimed Islam a new religion but in fact preached the unity of the religion since [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] the first person and prophet of Allah on the face of earth. The strongest Islamic belief is that Islam is the only religion which all prophets preached. Also Quran refers to all prophets as Muslims. Muhammad was born in [[Mecca|Makkah]] where he spent the first part of his life as a well-travelled merchant. He would often spend his time in the mountains surrounding Makkah in prayer contemplating the situation with the city. According to Islamic beliefs, at the age of forty during one of those trips to the mountain, Muhammad began to, despite his [[functional illiteracy|illiteracy]], receive and recite verses from [[Allah]] which today make up the [[Qur'an]]. He quickly began to spread the message he was receiving, convincing a few others in the city, including his wife, to convert a form of [[Islam]] similar to one practiced today. He became the leader of those who had submitted to Allah (Muslims), setting up a new city (present-day [[Medina]]) away from the oppressors in Makkah. Muhammad served not just as a prophet, but as a king/leader who helped defeat the Makkans in [[624]] during the [[Battle of Badr]]. He continued to lead the [[Muslim]]s spreading Islam across the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. He performed the first [[hajj]] in [[629]] and established the form of Islam, with its [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]] still practiced by Muslims today. Others continued Muhammad's legacy after his death in [[629]] proclaiming themselves as [[caliphs]] (or successors) to Muhammad.
