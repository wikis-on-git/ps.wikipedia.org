Within [[Smarta]] Hinduism, a variety of forms of God are seen as aspects of the one impersonal divine ground, [[Brahman]] (not [[Brahma]]). Brahman is seen as the universal spirit. Brahman is [[the ultimate]], both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanent]] the [[absolute infinite]] [[existence]], the sum total of all that ever is, was, or ever shall be. 

Brahman is not a [[God]] in the traditional sense, as it is not imbued with any limiting characteristics, not even those of being and non-being, and this is reflected in the fact that in [[Sanskrit]], the word Brahman is of neuter (as opposed to masculine or feminine) gender.

[[Vedanta]] is a branch of [[Hindu philosophy]] which gives this matter a greater focus. [[Yoga]] is the primary focus in many ways of a Hindu's religious activities, being somewhere between [[meditation]], [[prayer]] and healthful [[exercise]].

''Some'' of Hinduism's adherents are [[Smarta]] [[monist]]s, seeing multiple manifestations of the one God or source of being, which is often confused by non-Hindus as being [[polytheist]]. It is however properly seen as one unity, with the personal gods being different aspects of one Supreme Being, like a single beam of light separated into colours by a prism, and are valid to worship. 

[[Swami Vivekananda]], a follower of [[Ramakrishna]], along with many others, who brought Hindu beliefs to the West, were all [[Smarta]] in belief. Other denominations of Hinduism, as described later, don't hold this belief strictly and more closely adhere to a Western perception of what a monotheistic faith is. Additionally, like Judæo-Christian-Islamic religions which believe in [[angels]], Hindus also believe in less powerful entities, such as [[devas]].

==Trimurtiدرېګونوالي آند==

ترېمورتي په [[هندوييزم]] كې داسې دى، لكه په [[عيسويت]] كې چې د درېګونوالي اند. 
داسې ويل كېږي، چې د عيسوي ګروهې بنسټيزه ګروهه (د [[درېګونوالي ګرهه]]- [[تثليث]]) هم له هندوييزم څخه اخيستل شوې ده.

د [[هندوييزم]] په تريمورتي ګروهه كې هم درې څښتنه موجود دي، چې هغه له:

*[[براهما]] پنځوونكې (پيداكوونكې) څښتن
*[[وېشنو]] (د ورېځو او باران)څښتن
*[[شيوا]](پوه پنا كوونكې)څښتن څخه عبارت دي.

==نامتو څښتنان==

كه څه هم د [[هندوييزم]] په [[مذهب]] كې هرهغه شې، چې ګټه يا تاوان رسوونكې وي، د څښتن په توګه لمانځل كېږي، او دا ګرانه ده، چې ددې مذهب د څښتنانو اندازه ولګول شي، يو لوديځ ليكوال د هندوييزم د څښتنانو په اړه ليكي: كه چېرې دې كار ته كښېنم چې د هندو څښتنانو نومونه وليكم، نو په لكونو كتابونه به ورڅخه ډك شي، خو د دوي د څښتنانو نومونه به خلاص نه شي. 
له دې سره سره، بيا هم د ځينو نومونه به يې دلته راوړو:

[[هندوييزم]] د [[دېوي]]، [[كرېشنا]]، [[ګنېش]]، [[هنومن]] او [[لكشمي]] په نامه څښتنان لري، 


Smarta Hindus believe that God, in whatever form they prefer, ("''[[Ishta Devata]]'',", i.e., the preferred form of God) can grant worshippers grace to bring them closer to [[Moksha]], end of the [[reincarnation|cycle of rebirth]]. The great Hindu saint, [[Ramakrishna]], a [[monist]], was a prominent advocate of this view. He studied and embraced other religions, such as [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], and came to the same conclusion proclaimed by the [[Vedas]], "'''Truth is one, the wise call it by different names.'''" '''Also, "The Universal Reality is the same, but different people can call it by different names."
('''Ekam Sat Viprah Bahuda Vadanti''')'''

==Denominations of Hinduism==
Contemporary Hinduism traditionally has four major divisions, '''[[Saivism]], [[Shaktism]], [[Vaishnavism]],''' and ''' [[Smarthism]].'''

According to [http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Hinduism Adherents.com] there are
580,000,000 Vaishnavas, 220,000,000 Shaivites and 22,000,000 neo-Hindus and reform Hindus.

However the Shakti sect connects God as Lord Shiva also, as the Aparabrahm while Shakti is the Parabrahm. Further the Saura sect connects itself with Lord Vishnu, one of the 12 Adityas (solar deities.) Ganesha worshippers would connect themselves with Lord Shiva as Lord Shiva is the Father of Lord Ganesha and hence, Lord Ganesha is a Shaiv deity.

Hinduism is a very rich and complex religion. Each of its four denominations shares [[rituals]], [[beliefs]], traditions and personal Gods with one another, but each sect have a same and different philosophy on how to achieve life's ultimate goal ([[moksa]], liberation). For example a person can be a Shiv devotee and a Vishnu devotee but they can practice the Advaita Vedanta philosophy (Darshana) which believes there is no difference between the Brahman and the Soul. Conversely a Hindu may follow the Dvaita philosophy which stresses that Brahman and the Soul are not the same. But each denomination fundamentally  believes in different methods of self-realisation and in different aspects of the One Supreme God. However, each denomination respects and accepts all others, and conflict of any kind is rare.

[[Vaishnavism]], [[Saivism]] and [[Shaktism]], respectively believe in a monotheistic ideal of [[Vishnu]] (often as [[Krishna]]), [[Siva]], or [[Devi]]; this view does not exclude other personal Gods, as they are understood to be aspects of the chosen ideal (e.g., to many devotees of Krishna, Shiva is seen as having sprung from Krishna's creative force). Often, the monad Brahman is seen as the one source, with all other gods emanating therefrom. Thus, with all Hindus, there is a strong belief in all paths being true religions that lead to one God or source, whatever one chooses to call the ultimate truth.

Even Vaisnavites, like other Hindus, have tolerance for other beliefs because Lord [[Krishna]], [[avatar]] of Vishnu, said so in the Gita. Krishna said: 

:''"I am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity. Endowed with such a faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone."'' (Gita: 7:21-22). 

Another quote in the Gita states: 

:''"Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kuntī, but they do so in a wrong way."'' (Gita: 9:23). 

Even a Vedic verse illustrates this theme of tolerance. The [[Vedas]] are revered in Hinduism, regardless of denomination. For example, a well-known Rig Vedic hymn stemming from Hinduism states that "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously." This is in contrast with some other religious traditions, where one must believe in only one form of God and to totally reject or disdain other beliefs.

==Polytheistic gods==
Although the [[pantheistic]] system allowed only a subordinate rank to the old [[polytheist]]ic [[deity|gods]], and the actual religious belief of the people was probably but little affected by their existence, they continued to occupy an important place in the affections of the [[poet]], and were still represented as exercising considerable influence on the destinies of man. The most prominent of them were regarded as the appointed Loka palas, or guardians of the world; and as such they were made to preside over the four cardinal and (according to some authorities) the intermediate points of the compass. 

Thus [[Indra]], the chief of the devas, was regarded as the regent of the east; [[Agni]], the [[fire]], was in the same way associated with the [[southeast]]; [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], lord of death and justice with the [[south]]; [[Surya]], the [[sun]], with the [[southwest]]; [[Varuna]], originally the representative of the all-embracing [[heaven]] ([[celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]), now the god of the [[ocean]], with the [[west]]; [[Vayu]] (or [[Pavana]]), the [[wind]], with the [[northwest]]; [[Kubera]], the god of [[wealth]], with the [[north]]; and [[Soma]] with the [[northeast]]. (Note: In some traditions, [[Ishana|Īśāna]], an aspect of [[Siva]] is regarded as the regent of the [[northeast]] and [[Nirrti]] the regent of the [[southwest]].)

In the institutes of [[Manu Smriti|Manu]] the Loka palas are represented as standing in close relation to the ruling [[monarch|king]], who is [[saki]] to be composed of particles of these his tutelary deities. The retinue of Indra consists chiefly of the Devas(angels), [[Gandharvas]], a class of [[genii]], considered in the epics as the celestial [[musician]]s; and [[Apsaras]], lovely [[nymph]]s, who are frequently employed by the gods to make the pious devotee desist from carrying his austere practices to an extent that might render him dangerous to their power. [[Narada]], an ancient sage (probably a personification of the cloud, the water-giver), is considered as the messenger between the gods and men, and as having sprung from the forehead of Brahma. The interesting office of the god of love is held by [[Kamadeva]], also called Ananga, the bodyless, because, as the myth relates, having once tried by the power of his mischievous arrow to make Siva fall in love with Parvati, whilst he was engaged in devotional practices, the urchin was reduced to ashes by a glance of the angry god. Two other mythological figures of some importance are considered as sons of Siva and Parvati, viz. Karttikeya or Skanda, the leader of the heavenly armies, who was supposed to have been fostered by the six Knittikas or Pleiades; and Ganesha ( lord of troops ), the elephant-headed god of wisdom, and at the same time the leader of the dii minorum gentium.

==Smartism==

[[Smartism]], a denomination of [[Hinduism]] is a [[monist]] as well as a [[monotheist]] [[religion]] that understands different [[deities]] as representing various aspects and principles of one supreme entity, [[Brahman]] or parabrahman. After all, [[Swami Vivekananda]], a follower of [[Ramakrishna]], along with many others, who brought Hindu beliefs to the West, were all [[Smarta]] in belief.  Other denominations of Hinduism do not strictly hold this belief.
Only a Smartist would have no problem worshiping [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]] together as he views the different aspects of God as leading to the same One God. It is the Smarta view that dominates the view of [[Hinduism]] in the West. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the one true God, worthy of worship and other forms as subordinate. See for example, an illustration of the Vaishnavite view of Vishnu as the one true God, [http://www.dvaita.org/docs/srv_faq.html#othergods at this link]. 
Accordingly, many Vaishnavites, for example, believe that only [[Vishnu]] can grant the ultimate aim for mankind, [[moksha]]. See for example, [http://www.dvaita.org/docs/srv_faq.html#hell this link]. Similarly, many [[Shaivites]] also hold similar beliefs, as illustrated at [http://www.sroutasaivasiddhanta.org/2-1.htm at this link] and [http://www.sroutasaivasiddhanta.org/2-11.htm at this link].



==Devas in the Vedas==

The pantheon in the [[Śrauta|Śrauta tradition]] consists of various gods and goddesses. However these entities may not hold the traditional meaning of [[deity|gods]] and [[goddesses]] in English. Instead the ''devas'' (which is the sanskrit word used to represent these entities) represent certain forces. For instance, the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Agni]] has one aspect as the flame. but this flame symbolises the psychological power associated with [[Agni]] namely the power of will. Agni can be called God-will. Similarly [[Indra]] is the God-mind; [[Sarasvati]] is the Power of Inspiration, not merely of learning.<ref>Essentials of Krishna and Shukla Yajurveda- RL Kashyap; SAKSI, Bangalore, Karnataka ISBN 8179940322
