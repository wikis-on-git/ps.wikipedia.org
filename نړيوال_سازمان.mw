{{for|the political science journal|International Organization}}

An '''international organization''', or more formally '''intergovernmental organization''' ('''IGO'''), is an [[organization]] whose members are [[sovereign state]]s or other IGOs (like the [[European Union]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]).  Such organizations function according to the principles of [[intergovernmentalism]], which means that unanimity is required. The European Union is however an exception to this rule in some areas.

[[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) are private organizations that can also be international in scope. Generally and correctly used, however, the term "international organization" is reserved for intergovernmental organizations only. It is in this sense that the term is used in the remainder of this article.

==Legal nature==
Legally speaking, an international organization must be established by a [[treaty]] providing it with [[legal entity|legal recognition]]. International organizations so established are [[subject of international law|subjects of international law]], capable of entering into agreements among themselves or with states. Thus international organizations in a legal sense are distinguished from mere groupings of states, such as the [[G-8]] and the [[Group of 77|G-77]], neither of which have been founded by treaty, though in non-legal contexts these are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well.

International organizations must also be distinguished from treaties; while all international organizations are founded on a treaty, many treaties (e.g., the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA)) do not establish an international organization and rely purely on the parties for the......

==Membership and function==

International organizations differ in function, membership and membership criteria. Membership of some organizations ([[global organization]]s) is open to all the nations of [[Earth|the world]]. This category includes the [[United Nations]] and its specialized agencies and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Other organizations are only open to members from a particular [[subregion|region]] or [[continent]] of the world, like [[European Union]], [[African Union]], [[ASEAN]] and so on.

Finally, some organizations base their membership on other criteria: '''cultural or historical links''' (the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]), level of '''economic''' development or type of economy ([[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries]] (OPEC)), or '''religion''' ([[Organization of the Islamic Conference]]).

Were it to come about, the ultimate international organization would be a [[Federal World Government]].

In the [[nineteenth century]], [[France]] was the ''fons et origo'' of many international organizations: This means that much of the driving force to form such bodies (such as those which maintain the [[SI]] (metric system)) came from the French, and that their headquarters is in France, often in [[Paris]]. Under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|International Exposition of 1878]] in that city held a great number of meetings of such international organizations - as opposed to the preceding regimes. The motivation was that to keep France a republic and not slip back into either a monarchist or [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] regime, the republicans would underscore their inheritance of the crusading nature of the [[French Revolution]] against feudal cultural remnants within France, which had been generalized to the rest of feudal Europe, eventually to the world. Some conclude from this example that internationalism often has national origins, at the difference of [[globalism]].

The [[Union of International Associations]] provides information on international organizations.
