== تاريخ==   
{{main|History of Zimbabwe}}
   
The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They were largely replaced by [[Bantu]] tribes during a series of [[human migration|migrations]]. The southern part of the country was named Matabeleland after the Ndebele tribe who occupied the area in the early 1800's under a loose confederation of Ndebele-speaking tribes headed by the Khumalo tribe under their chief [[Mzilikazi]]. Resentment has simmered ever since between this group of peoples and the Shona-speaking tribes in Mashonaland, the northern part of Zimbabwe.

=== Colonial era ===   
In 1888, [[Cecil Rhodes]] signed a treaty with King [[Lobengula]] of the [[Ndebele]], who succeeded Mzilikazi. It allowed extensive British intervention in the area, and its purpose was primarily to allow mineral extraction. In 1889, Rhodes obtained a charter for the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC), with the object of occupying and administering what subsequently became known as [[Rhodesia]], and mining gold and other minerals. In 1895 a column of 200 armed white men recruited by the BSAC in South Africa, occupied [[Mashonaland]] and promoted the colonization of the region and its land, labour, and mineral resources. 

In 1896-1897 the Ndebele and the Shona staged unsuccessful revolts against white colonialists' encroachment on their native lands. This was later known as the first ''Chimurenga'' (War of Liberation). [[Nehanda Nyakasikana]], [[Chaminuka]], [[Muponda]], and other Shona spirit mediums and rulers were leaders in this rebellion, and were later captured and executed. The Shonas and the Ndebeles with their spears and [[knobkerry|knobkerries]] were no match for the heavily armed [[British South Africa Police]] (as the police force of Rhodesia was called), who had horses, guns and cannons.
 
Southern Rhodesia was administered by Rhodes' BSAC until 1922. In a referendum that year, the settler population rejected a proposal for incorporation into the [[Union of South Africa]], and instead became a British [[self-governing colony]]. 

In 1953, Southern Rhodesia and [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now called [[Zambia]]) combined with Nyasaland (now called [[Malawi]]) to form the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], also called the [[Central Africa|Central African Federation]]. 

After the federation dissolved in 1963, the white minority administration in Southern Rhodesia (called simply [[Rhodesia]] from 1964) demanded independence, but the British government had adopted a policy of No Independence Before Majority African Rule ([[NIBMAR]]).
   
In response, the government of [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]] made a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] on [[November 11]], [[1965]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/11/newsid_2658000/2658445.stm 1965: Rhodesia breaks from UK] BBC On This Day (accessed [[03 April]] 2006)</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] called the declaration a direct act of rebellion, and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] imposed economic sanctions. In 1968 the [[UN]] voted to make the sanctions mandatory but they were largely ineffective. In an attempt to distance the country from the UK, Smith declared Rhodesia a [[republic]] in 1970, but this did not result in international recognition. Smith continued to administer a largely segregated social system that has been compared to [[apartheid]].

=== Self-declared independence ===   
Opposition to white rule strengthened and began with a skirmish at [[Chinoyi]], where six fighters of the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) fought government forces. ZANLA and [[ZIPRA]] (Zimbaber People's Revolutionary Army) used [[guerrilla]] tactics similar to those of the [[Viet Cong]] during the [[Vietnam War]].  

Around the world, the movement for equal rights for Africans in Africa and in the [[diaspora]] intensified in the second half of the 20th century.  With the end of Portuguese rule in neighbouring [[Mozambique]] in 1975, the Liberation Front of Mozambique ([[Frelimo]]) led by [[Samora Machel]] lent assistance to ZANLA, and the resistance intensified into a large-scale uprising called the [[Second Chimurenga]].

The Rhodesian Security Forces had operational successes against the Communist-backed guerrillas.  Even under the strain of economic and military [[sanctions]], Rhodesian forces mounted highly effective external raids on guerrilla forward bases in Zambia and Mozambique, while evolving "fireforce" battle tactics. 

But by 1978, Smith and his cabinet had realized that the situation was no longer tenable, and sought a compromise with moderate black leaders. They selected Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] to become the new leader of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] with assistance from Ndabaningi Sithole.   
   
Muzorewa had the support of Smith and the [[South Africa]]n government, but lacked credibility among significant sectors of the African population. The Muzorewa government soon faltered. In 1979, the British Government asked all parties to come to [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House]], London to negotiate a settlement to the civil war.

=== International recognition of independence and the rise of ZANU ===   
Following the conference held in 1979-1980, Britain's [[Lord Soames]] was appointed governor to oversee the disarming of revolutionary guerrillas, the holding of elections, and the granting of independence to an uneasy coalition government with [[Joshua Nkomo]], head of [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]]. In the free elections of February 1980, [[Robert Mugabe]] and his Zimbabwe African National Union ([[ZANU]]) won a landslide victory, and Mugabe has won every election since, although most elections have not been considered "free and fair" according to international standards, with intimidation of voters and harassment of opposition members alleged.

=== ZANU-ZAPU fighting ===
In 1982 Nkomo was ousted from his cabinet; when a cache of weapons of war was discovered at properties owned by him and his top lieutenants, sparking fighting between ZAPU supporters in the southern Ndebele-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. There were widespread attacks on white farmers and Shonas in small parts of Masvingo, Midlands, and Matebeleland provinces. The most famous were by Gwesela who led his followers in attacks against Shonas. 

The government mobilized the [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] (also called the [[Gukurahundi]]) led by Colonel [[Perence Shiri]] to quell the insurgency. In February 1983 they went to [[Tsholotsho]], Matebeleland North; in 1984, they moved across the Manzamnyama River into Matebeleland South.  In the turn of events, multiple atrocities were committed against the Ndebele. 

Ultimately, Mugabe and Nkomo held peace talks that saw a return to calm and the reunification of the Patriotic Front. Clemency was given to those who had committed atrocities on both sides. The peace accord in 1987, resulted in PF ZAPU's merger (1988) with  ZANU Patriotic Front ([[ZANU-PF]]).

===Land reform===

The [[drought]] in southern [[Africa]], perhaps the worst in a century, affected Zimbabwe so severely that a national disaster was declared in 1992. The drought compounded the country's debt crisis.  The ensuing [[IMF]]-backed economic adjustment and austerity program caused further widespread hardship. Continued intimidation of the [[Ndebele_people_(Zimbabwe)|Ndebele minority]] in the south has caused nearly a million of them to flee to South Africa.
   
With the implementation of [[majority rule]], whites remained dominant in the nation's economy. They made up less than 1% of the population but held 70% of the country's commercially viable [[arable land]], of which only a small parcel had been purchased and reallocated to blacks since independence in 1980, in spite of millions of pounds of aid from Britain given for this purpose. Most purchased farms ended up as the property of high-ranking military and political personnel. However whites held no political power. [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Land redistribution]] from whites reemerged as a political issue beginning in 1999.
   
The forced removal of the white farmers caused sharp rises in prices of agricultural commodities such as corn and sugar, and the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy. Zimbabwe was formerly an important net food exporter to the region, but in recent years starvation has been widespread because of Mugabe's land reform policy, which redistributed land to political supporters of Mugabe who do not farm the land efficiently. This has left the large majority of landless blacks worse off, due to a catastrophic fall in productivity, a spectacular rise in [[inflation]] (1000% in May 2006) and widespread unemployment.<ref name=bbcprofile>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/country_profiles/1064589.stm Country profile: Zimbabwe] BBC Online (accessed [[03 April]] 2006)</ref>
   
In the aftermath of Mugabe's handling of the land crisis, which redistributed land to selected blacks by forcefully removing owners without compensation, Zimbabwe was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on charges of [[human rights]] abuses and of [[election]] tampering in 2002, including widespread intimidation and violence against supporters of opposition parties. Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth on [[7 December]] [[2003]].

=== Demolitions ===
After elections in 2005, the government began [[Operation Murambatsvina]], meaning "Drive out the Trash", in a supposed effort to crackdown on illegal markets and homes, that had seen both slums unfit for human habitation, and well-built brick and mortar homes, emerge in towns and cities. 

This action has been widely condemned by opposition and international figures, who charge that it has left a large section of the urban poor homeless. The UN estimates that 700,000 people have had their homes demolished by Mugabe's program. <ref name=bbcprofile/> 

Mugabe's Government has initiated the housing construction programme ''Operation Garikai'', but this is not available to a large number of the poorest citizens, and will do little to solve the problem, according to a UN report <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4488796.stm UN Zimbabwe aid efforts 'flawed'] BBC Online (accessed [[03 April]] 2006)</ref>.

Zimbabwe is a [[republic]], with an [[executive president]] and a [[bicameral]] [[Parliament|Parliament]]. Under constitutional changes in 2005, an [[upper chamber]] &mdash; the [[Senate]] &mdash; was reinstated. The [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|House of Assembly]] is the [[lower chamber]] of Parliament.   
   
[[Zanu PF]] [[Robert Mugabe]], elected Prime Minister in 1980, revised the [[constitution]] in 1987 to make himself President. President Mugabe's affiliated party has won every election since independence [[April 18]] 1980. In some quarters corruption and rigging elections have been alleged. In particular the elections of 1990 were nationally and internationally condemned as being rigged, with the second-placed party, [[Edgar Tekere|Edgar Tekere's]] Zimbabwe Unity Movement, winning only 20% of the vote. Presidential elections were last held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation, and fraud. The next Presidential elections are to be held in 2008.    
   
The major opposition party at the moment is the [[Movement for Democratic Change]], or MDC, led by [[Morgan Tsvangirai]]. At the present time, November 2005, the MDC is currently split into two factions. One faction, led by [[Welshman Ncube]] is contesting the elections to the Senate, while the other led by Morgan Tsvangirai is opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that elections in Zimbabwe are completely free and fair. The two MDC camps had their congresses earlier this year with Morgan Tsvangirai being elected to lead the main splinter group which has become more popular than the other group. Professor Arthur G.O Mutambara a Robotics Professor and former NASA robotics specialist has been appointed to replace Welshman Ncube who was the interim leader after the split. The Mutambara faction has however been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are dissillusioned by their manifesto. To date the Tsvangirai led MDC has become the most popular with crowds as large as 20,000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500-5,000 for the other splinter group.  
   
The [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections]] were held on March 31. While the [[African Union]] reported no major irregularities, opposition figures such as Archbishop [[Pius Ncube]] have made charges of vote rigging. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3793417 Robert Mugabe is poised to rig a general election once again (Mar 23rd 2005)] www.economist.com (accessed [[03 April]] 2006)</ref>

Zimbabwe is a [[landlocked country]], surrounded by [[South Africa]] to the south, [[Botswana]] to the west, [[Zambia]] to the northwest and [[Mozambique]] to the east and northeast. The northwestern border is defined by the [[Zambezi]] River. [[Victoria Falls]] is a popular tourist destination on the Zambezi. To the south, Zimbabwe is separated from [[South Africa]] by the [[Limpopo River]]. Zimbabwe also shares a narrow border with [[Namibia]] to the west via a narrow land corridor.

== اقتصاد ==   
''Main article: [[Economy of Zimbabwe]]''   

The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems as it struggles to consolidate earlier progress in developing a [[Market economy|market-oriented economy]]. Current problems include a shortage of [[foreign exchange]], soaring inflation, and supply shortages. Its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], for example, drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. Badly needed support from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] has been suspended because of the country's failure to meet budgetary goals. 

[[Image:ZimShopJM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shop, Eastern Highlands, 1989]]
According to official figures, inflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in 1998 to 1193.5% in May 2006, a state of [[hyperinflation]], while the exchange rate fell from 24 [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s per US dollar to 101,195.54 [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s per US Dollar (official rate) and 400,000 [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s per US Dollar (parallel rate), in the same time period. 

The impact of [[land reform in Zimbabwe]] has badly damaged the ability of the commercial farming sector to gain foreign exchange. <ref>[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/zi.html CIA World Factbook] (accessed [[03 April]] 2006)</ref>

On 1 November 1989, a former junior minister, [[Denis Walker]], produced a paper in London for the [[Conservative Monday Club]]'s Foreign Affairs Committee on ''Land Reform in Zimbabwe''. In his last paragraph he stated, with clear insight, as events have proved, that "once the land has been redistributed, the commercial farms will be broken up, the remaining white farmers reduced by exile or imprisonment; Zimbabwe's government, already morally bankrupt, will decline towards economic collapse."

In a recent investigation in ''[[The Independent]]'' it was uncovered that many state-controlled mines have been sold cheaply to the Chinese, in a desperate scramble for foreign currency.  It was noted that Mugabe's regime has forsaken much of the control of economic resources, which will prevent Zimbabwe from rebuilding the economy even if the [[Movement for Democratic Change|MDC]] take charge.
