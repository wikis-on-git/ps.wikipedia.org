'''Music''' is an [[art]] form that involves organized and audible [[sound]]s and [[silence]].  It is usually expressed in terms of [[pitch]] (which includes [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (which includes [[tempo]] and [[meter (music)|meter]]), and the quality of sound (which includes [[timbre]], [[articulation (music)|articulation]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[texture (music)|texture]]). Music may also involve generative [[form (music)|forms]] in time through the construction of [[pattern]]s and [[combinations]] of natural stimuli, principally sound. Music may be used for [[art]]istic or [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[communication|communicative]], [[entertainment]], or ceremonial purposes. The [[Definitions of music|definition]] of what constitutes music varies according to culture and social context.  

Within "[[the arts]]", music can be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], or an [[auditory art|auditory art form]].

{{main|Definition of music}}
{{see also|Music genre}}
The broadest [[definition of music]] is organized [[vibration]]. There are observable patterns to what is broadly labeled music, and while there are understandable cultural variations, the properties of music are the properties of sound as perceived and processed by humans and animals (birds and insects also make music).

Music is a personal response to vibration since the same piece of music will affect people differently. Although it cannot contain emotions, it is sometimes designed to manipulate and transform the emotions of the listeners. For example, a piece of [[film score|music created for a movie]] is primarily designed to heighten the emotion or mood of each scene in the film.

[[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] and medieval theorists defined music as tones ordered horizontally as [[melody|melodies]], and vertically as [[harmony|harmonies]]. [[Music theory]], within this realm, is studied with the pre-supposition that music is orderly and often pleasant to hear. However, in the 20th century, composers challenged the notion that music had to be pleasant by creating music that explored harsher, darker [[timbres]]. The existence of some modern-day [[Music genre|genres]] such as [[grindcore]] and [[noise music]], which enjoy an extensive underground following, indicate that even the crudest noises can be considered music if the listener is so inclined.

20th century composer [[John Cage]] disagreed with the notion that music must consist of pleasant, discernible melodies, and he challenged the notion that it can communicate anything. Instead, he argued that any sounds we can hear can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound,"[http://arted.osu.edu/160/03_cage.php]. According to musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1990 p.47-8,55): "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined--which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.... By all accounts there is no single and intercultural universal concept defining what music might be." 

[[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] believed that patterns and forms were the basis of music; he stated that "architecture is frozen music."

== تاريخ==
{{main|History of music}}
{{see also|Music and politics}}

The history of music predates the written word and is tied to the development of each unique human [[culture]].  Although the earliest records of musical expression are to be found in the [[Sama Veda]] of [[India]] and in 4,000 year old cuneiform from [[Ur]], most of our written records and studies deal with the history of music in [[Western civilization]]{{cn}}.  This includes musical periods such as medieval, renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic, and 20th century era music.  The history of music in other cultures has also been documented to some degree, and the knowledge of "[[world music]]" (or the field of "[[ethnomusicology]]") has become more and more sought after in academic circles. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. (The term ''world music'' has been applied to a wide range of music made outside of Europe and European influence, although its initial application, in the context of the World Music Program at [[Wesleyan University]], was as a term including all possible music genres, including European traditions. In academic circles, the original term for the study of world music, "comparative musicology", was replaced in the middle of the twentieth century by "ethnomusicology", which is still considered an unsatisfactory coinage by some.) 

Popular styles of music varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[Musical instrument|instrument]]s, or techniques, or uses for music. Music has been used not only for entertainment, for ceremonies, and for practical & artistic communication, but also extensively for [[propaganda]]. 
   
As world cultures have come into [[globalisation|greater contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged into new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from Anglo-Irish, Scottish, Irish, German and some African-American instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the US' multi-ethnic "melting pot" society.

There is a host of music classifications, many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the division between [[European classical music|classical music]] (or "art" music), and [[popular music]] (or commercial music - including [[rock and roll]], [[country music]], and [[pop music]]).  Some genres don't fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], world music, or [[jazz]] music). 

Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. While most classical music is acoustic and meant to be performed by individuals or groups, many works described as "classical" include samples or tape, or are mechanical. Some works, like [[Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music.  Many current [[music festivals]] celebrate a particular musical [[genre]].

There is often disagreement over what constitutes "real" music: late-period [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] string quartets, [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era [[Jazz]], [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[punk rock]], and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.

== Aspects ==
{{main|Aspects of music}}

The traditional or classical European [[aspects of music]] often listed are those elements given primacy in European-influenced classical music: [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], [[Timbre|tone color or timbre]], and [[Musical form|form]]. A more comprehensive list is given by stating the aspects of sound: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]], [[loudness]], and [[duration]].<ref>Owen, 2000: 6</ref> These aspects combine to create secondary aspects including [[structure]], [[texture (music)|texture]] and style. Other commonly included aspects include the spatial location or the movement in space of sounds, gesture, and dance. 
[[Silence]] has long been  considered an aspect of music, ranging from the dramatic pauses in Romantic-era symphonies to the avant-garde use of silence as an artistic statement in 20th century works such as [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4'33]]."''John Cage considers duration the primary aspect of music because it is the only aspect common to both "sound" and "silence."

As mentioned above, not only do the aspects included as music vary, their importance varies. For instance, melody and harmony are often considered to be given more importance in classical music at the expense of rhythm and timbre. It is often debated whether there are aspects of music that are universal. The debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that "tonality" is universal to all music requires an expansive definition of tonality. 

A [[pulse (music)|pulse]] is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free, improvisational rhythms with no regular pulse;<ref>Johnson, 2002</ref> one example is the [[alap]] section of a [[Hindustani music]] performance. According to Dane Harwood, "We must ask whether a cross-cultural musical universal is to be found in the music itself (either its structure or function) or the way in which music is made. By 'music-making,' I intend not only actual performance but also how music is heard, understood, even learned." <ref>Harwood, 1976: 522</ref>

== Production ==
{{main|Music industry}}
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. [[Amateur]] musicians compose and perform music for their own pleasure, and they do not attempt to derive their income from music. Professional [[musicians]] are employed by a range of institutions and organizations, including armed forces, churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools. As well, professional musicians work as freelancers, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. 

Although amateur musicians differ from professional musicians in that amateur musicians have a non-musical source of income, there are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles and orchestras. In some rare cases, amateur musicians attain a professional level of competence, and they are able to perform in professional performance settings.

A distinction is often made between music performed for the benefit of a live audience and music that is performed for the purpose of being recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is recorded and distributed (or broadcast).     

=== Performance ===
{{main|Performance}}

[[Image:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]

Someone who performs, composes, or conducts music is a musician. Musicians perform music for a variety of reasons. Some artists express their feelings in music.  Performing music is an enjoyable activity for amateur and professional musicians, and it is often done for the benefit of an audience, who is deriving some aesthetic, social, religious, or ceremonial value from the performance. Part of the motivation for professional performers is that they derive their income from making music. Not only is it an income derived motivation, music has become a part of life as well as society.  Allowing one to be motivated through self intrinsic motivations as well, as a saying goes "for the love of music."  As well, music is performed in the context of practicing, as a way of developing musical skills. Many musicians also participate in [[music competition]]s as a way of learning about the work of other performers and motivating themselves to attain higher levels of performance.

=== Solo and ensemble ===
Many cultures include strong traditions of [[solo (music)|solo]] or soloistic [[performance]], such as in [[Indian classical music]], and in the Western Art music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of [[musical ensemble|group]] performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organized performance rituals such as the modern classical [[concert]], [[religion|religious procession]]s, music festivals or [[music competition]]s. 

[[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with no more than one of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than [[symphonic]] works. A performer is called a [[musician]] or singer, and they may be part of a [[musical ensemble]] such as a [[rock band]] or symphony [[orchestra]].

=== Aural tradition and notation ===
{{main|Musical notation}}

[[Image:Claves.png|thumb|Musical notation]]

Music is often preserved in memory and performance only, handed down [[oral history|orally]], or aurally ("by ear"). When the composer of music is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those which demand [[improvisation]] or modification to the music. In the Gambia, West Africa, the history of the country is passed aurally through song.

When music is written down, it is generally notated so that there are instructions regarding what should be heard by listeners, and what the musician should do to perform the music. This is referred to as [[musical notation]], and the study of how to read notation involves [[music theory]], harmony, the study of performance practice, and in some cases an understanding of historical performance methods. 

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In Western Art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords, lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Nonetheless, scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "big bands." 

In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in tablature, which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard, as on such instruments there are typically more than one possible voicing of a chord/note. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute, a stringed, fretted instrument.  

Generally music which is to be performed is produced as [[sheet music]]. To perform music from notation requires an understanding of both the musical style and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or genre. The detail included explicitly in the music notation varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through to the 19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. 

For example, in the 17th and 18th century, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unornamented melody. However, it was expected that performers would know how to add stylistically-appropriate ornaments such as trills and turns. 

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. It was expected that the performer would know how to use tempo changes, accentuation, and pauses (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. 

In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit, and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece. In popular music and jazz, music notation almost always indicates only the basic framework of the melody, harmony, or performance approach; musicians and singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated with specific genres and pieces. 

For example, the "lead sheet" for a jazz tune may only indicate the  melody and the chord changes. The performers in the jazz ensemble are expected to know how to "flesh out" this basic structure by adding ornaments, improvised music, and chordal accompaniment.

=== Improvisation, interpretation, composition ===
{{main|Musical composition|Musical improvisation|Free improvisation}}
Most cultures use at least part of the concept of preconceiving musical material, or [[musical composition|composition]], as held in western classical music. Even when music is notated precisely, there are still many decisions that a performer has to make. The process of a performer deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed [[interpretation]]. 

Different performers' interpretations of the same music can vary widely. Composers and song writers who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others or folk music. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[performance practice]], where as interpretation is generally used to mean either individual choices of a performer, or an aspect of music which is not clear, and therefore has a "standard" interpretation.

In some musical genres, such as jazz and blues, even more freedom is given to the performer to engage in [[improvisation]] on a basic melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic framework. The greatest latitude is given to the performer in a style of performing called [[free improvisation]], which is material that is spontaneously "thought of" (imagined) while being performed, ''not'' preconceived. According to the analysis of Georgiana Costescu, improvised music usually follows stylistic or genre conventions and even "fully composed" includes some freely chosen material (see [[precompositional]]). Composition does not always mean the use of notation, or the known sole authorship of one individual. 

Music can also be determined by describing a "process" which may create musical sounds, examples of this range from wind chimes, through computer programs which select sounds. Music which contains elements selected by chance is called [[Aleatoric music]], and is often associated with [[John Cage]] and [[Witold Lutosławski]].

=== Composition ===
[[Musical composition]] is a term that describes the [[composition]] of a piece of music. Methods of composition vary widely from one [[composer]] to another, however in analyzing music all forms -- spontaneous, trained, or untrained -- are built from elements comprising a musical piece. Music can be composed for repeated performance or it can be [[improvised]]; composed on the spot. The music can be performed entirely from memory, from a written system of [[musical notation]], or some combination of both. Study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of [[Western classical music]], but the definition of composition is broad enough to include spontaneously improvised works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and [[African]] drummers. 

What is important in understanding the composition of a piece is singling out its elements. An understanding of music's [[formal elements]] can be helpful in deciphering exactly how a piece is constructed. A universal element of music is how sounds occur in [[time]], which is referred to as the [[rhythm]] of a piece of music. 

When a piece appears to have a changing [[time]]-feel, it is considered to be in [[rubato]] time, an [[Italian language|Italian]] expression that indicates that the [[tempo]] of the piece changes to suit the expressive intent of the performer. Even random placement of random sounds, which occurs in [[musical montage]], occurs within some kind of [[time]], and thus employs [[time]] as a musical element.

== Reception and audition ==
{{main|Hearing (sense)}}

[[Image:Mozarteum grosser saal buehne mit orchester.jpg|thumb|Concert in the Mozarteum, Salzburg]]

The field of [[music cognition]] involves the study of many aspects of music including how it is processed by listeners. 

Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "high culture" and "low culture." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats. 

On the other hand, other types of music such as jazz, blues, soul, and country are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls. 

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music. Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the socioeconomic standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music. 

For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a hip-hop concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes. Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, hip-hop, punk, funk, or ska may be very complex and sophisticated.

[[Deaf]] people can experience music by feeling the vibrations in their body, a process which can be enhanced if the individual holds a resonant, hollow object. A well-known deaf musician is the composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who composed many famous works even after he had completely lost his hearing. Recent examples of deaf musicians include [[Evelyn Glennie]], a highly acclaimed percussionist who has been deaf since the age of twelve, and [[Chris Buck (violinist)|Chris Buck]], a virtuoso violinist who has lost his hearing.

== Media and Technology ==
The music that composers make can be heard through several [[mass media|media]]; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence, or as one of the musicians. Live music can also be broadcast over the [[radio]], [[television]] or the [[internet]]. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording which mixes together sounds which were never played "live". Recording, even of styles which are essentially live, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings which are considered better than the actual performance.

As [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.<ref>[http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php American Federation of Musicians/History] "1927 – With the release of the first 'talkie,' ''The Jazz Singer,'' orchestras in movie theaters were displaced. The AFM had its first encounter with wholesale unemployment brought about by technology. Within three years, 22,000 theater jobs for musicians who accompanied silent movies were lost, while only a few hundred jobs for musicians performing on soundtracks were created by the new technology. 1928 – While continuing to protest the loss of jobs due to the use of 'canned music' with motion pictures, the AFM set minimum wage scales for Vitaphone, Movietone and phonograph record work. Because synchronizing music with pictures for the movies was particularly difficult, the AFM was able to set high prices for this work."</ref> More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped; according to historian Preston J. Hubbard, "During the 1920s live musical performances at first-run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema."<ref>Hubbard (1985), p. 429.</ref> With the coming of the talkies, those featured performances—usually staged as preludes—were largely eliminated as well. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever" and reads in part:
<blockquote>
'''Canned Music on Trial'''<br>
This is the case of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres. The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education. Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music. If the theatre-going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable. Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanisation. It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist, upon the human contact, without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost.<ref>[http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/dynaweb/adaccess/radio/1922-1929/@Generic__BookTextView/1469;nh=1?DwebQuery=canned+in+%3Cc01%3E#X "Canned Music on Trial"] part of Duke University's ''Ad*Access'' project. The text of the ad continues:
<blockquote>
'''Is Music Worth Saving?'''<br> No great volume of evidence is required to answer this question. Music is a well-nigh universally beloved art. From the beginning of history, men have turned to musical expression to lighten the burdens of life, to make them happier. Aborigines, lowest in the scale of savagery, chant their song to tribal gods and play upon pipes and shark-skin drums. Musical development has kept pace with good taste and ethics throughout the ages, and has influenced the gentler nature of man more powerfully perhaps than any other factor. Has it remained for the Great Age of Science to snub the Art by setting up in its place a pale and feeble shadow of itself?<br>'''American Federation of Musicians (Comprising 140,000 musicians in the United States and Canada), Joseph N. Weber, President. Broadway, New York City'''.

</blockquote>

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of [[1992]] in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and internet in a form that is commonly known as [[music-on-demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, as virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[sound recording]] or watching a [[music video]], became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. 

Sometimes, live [[performance]]s incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a [[DJ]] uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. [[Computers]] and many [[keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[MIDI]] music. Audiences can also ''become'' the performers by using [[Karaoke]], invented by the Japanese, which uses music video and tracks without voice, so the performer can add their voice to the piece.

== Education ==

Professional musicians in some cultures and musical genres compose, perform, and improvise music with no formal training. Musical genres where professional musicians are typically self-taught or where they learn through informal mentoring and creative exchanges include blues, punk, and popular music genres such as [[rock (music)|rock]] and pop.

Undergraduate university degrees in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the [[Bachelor of Music Education]], and the [[Bachelor of Arts]] with a major in music typically take three to five years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program.  

Graduates of undergraduate music programs can go on to further study in music graduate programs. Graduate degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]], the [[PhD]], and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education,voice or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a thesis, is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, or music theory. 

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the Master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The Doctor of Musical Arts, or DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a Master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. 

=== Music as Part of General Education ===
{{main|Music education}}
The incorporation of music training from [[preschool]] to postsecondary education is common in North America and Europe, because involvement in music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and [[cooperation]] while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conductive to learning in other areas. <ref>Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002</ref> In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music. In secondary schools students may have the opportunity to perform some type of musical ensembles, such as [[choirs]], [[marching bands]], [[concert band]]s, [[jazz band]]s, or [[orchestras]], and in some school systems, music classes may be available.

At the [[university]] level, students in most arts and humanities programs can receive credit for taking music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the history of music, or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some type of musical ensembles that non-music students are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, or orchestras.

The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as [[STSI]] in [[Bali]], or the Classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. Gamelan music).

Both amateur and professional musicians typically take [[music lessons]], short private sessions with an individual teacher. Amateur musicians typically take lessons to learn musical rudiments and beginner- to intermediate-level musical techniques.

=== د موسيقي زده کړه===
{{main|musicology|music theory}}

Many people also study ''about'' music in the field of [[musicology]]. The earliest definitions of [[musicology]] defined three sub-disciplines: [[systematic musicology]], [[historical musicology]], and [[comparative musicology]]. In contemporary scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called [[ethnomusicology]]. 

In [[Medieval]] times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative [[Quadrivium]], music, or more accurately [[harmonics]], was the study of rational proportions. 

[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" François-Bernard Mâche's ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of Ruwet's ''Language, musique, poésie'' (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that birdsongs are organized according to a repetition-transformation principle. In the opinion of [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1990), "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organized and conceptualized (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

Music theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[tonal music]]. Theory, even that which studies music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[atonal music]]. [[Speculative music theory]], contrasted with [[analytic music theory]], is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote in the 16th century in his classic work, ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially [[melancholia]]. <ref>cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3480, "Music a Remedy":<blockquote>
But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise [3481]of divine music, I
will confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it
hath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against [3482]
despair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself. Canus, a
Rhodian fiddler, in [3483]Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to
know what he could do with his pipe, told him, "That he would make a
melancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a
lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout." Ismenias the Theban,
[3484]Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other
