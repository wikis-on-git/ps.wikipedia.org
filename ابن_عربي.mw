'''ابو عبدالله محمد بن علي بن محمد بن العربي الحاتمي الطايي''' ([[عربي ژبه|عربي]]: أبن عربي)، د اسلامي نړۍ له سترو فلسفيانو، صوفيانو او عالمانو څخه دى. په تصوف كې د شيخ اكبر مقام ته رسېدلې. هغه په [[1165]] کال کې په [[مورسيا]] کې زېږېدلی وه او په [[1240]] کال کې په [[دمشق]] کې مړ شو.

== نوم ==
'''ابو عبدالله محمد بن علي بن محمد بن العربي الحاتمي الطايي''' ('''{{lang|ar|أبو عبد الله محمد بن علي بن محمد بن العربي الحاتمي الطائي }}''')

چې په غربي نړۍ کې د ''ډوکټور ماکزيموس'' په نامه يادېږي او په اسلامي نړۍ کې د '''محيي الدين''' "Revivifier of religion" او ''الشيخ الأكبر'' ("لوی استاد") په لقبونو هم ياد شوی.
ابن عربي په عقيدوي لحاظ دوحدة الوجود دعقيدې قايل دي او اکثر کتابونه يې له خرافاتو ډک دي چې داسلام داصيلي عقيدي ضد او د عيسويت او بوديزم له عقايدو څخه اخيستل شوي.
ابن عربي دخپل کتاب فصوص الحكم په اړه وايې چې :
ما رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم د٦٢٧م کال دمحرم په وروستۍ لسيزه کې په دمشق (سوريه) کې وليد چې دهغه په لاس کې يو کتاب ؤ ، ما ته يې وويل : د دفصوص الحکم کتاب دى دا کتاب واخله او خلکو ته يې ورسوه ترڅو ترې ګټه واخلي ، ما ورته وويل : په سترګو ... او په آخر کې زياتوي چې دا همغه کتاب دى چې رسول الله ماته راکړى ؤ پرته له څه کمښت او زياتواي !!!!
ابن عربي پخپلو ليکنو کې داسي واضح کفر ويلى چې داسلامي تاريخ په اوږدو کې هيڅ انسان هم دهغې جرئت نه و کړى .
ابن عربي ځان له ټولو پيغمبرانو غوره ګڼي او ځکه چې هغه وايي چې څه خاتم الاولياء يم لکه څنګه چې رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم خاتم النبيين دى او ولي ځکه په پيغمپر غوره دى چې پيغمپر دوحى پواسطه دالله پيغام انسانانو ته راوړي او ولي مخامخ له الله سره اړيکې لري.
ابن عربي دصليبي نړي او په ځانګړى توګه دمستشرقينو له خوا ډير مشهور کړاى شو او دهغه کتابونه مختلفو ژبو ته وژباړل شول .
ابن عربي دقرآن په تفسير او ترجمه کې داسې تحريف او غلطۍ کړي چې يو عادي مسلمان هم دهغه دعقيدې په خرابۍ پوهيږي .

{{ژباړل}}
ابن عربي ته اکثراً د يو مرموز فيلسوف په سترګه کتل کېږي. د هغه د ژوند په مهال هغه ته په سوفيت کې يو ډېر اهم او لوړ سوفي ښوونکی او لارښود ګڼل کېده. <br />
A vastly prolific writer, Ibn Arabi is generally known as the prime exponent of the idea that would later be termed ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood|wahdat al-wujud]]'' (وحدة الوجود, "unity of being"), though he has never used this term in any of his writings. His emphasis, as with any mystic, lay rather on the true potential of the human being and the path to realising that potential, which reaches its completion in the Perfect or Complete Man ([[al-insan al-kamil]]). Ibn Arabi wrote at least 300 works, ranging from minor treatises to the huge 37-volume Meccan Revelations ([[al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya]]) and the quintessence of his teachings, The Seals of Wisdom ([[Fusus al-hikam]]). Approximately 110 works are known to have survived in verifiable manuscripts, some 18 in Ibn Arabi’s own hand. He exerted an unparalleled influence, not only upon his immediate circle of friends and disciples, many of whom were considered spiritual masters in their own right, but also on succeeding generations, affecting the whole course of subsequent spiritual thought and practice in the Arabic, Turkish and Persian-speaking worlds. In recent years his writings have also become increasingly the subject of interest and study in the West, leading to the establishment of an international academic Society in his name.

Ibn Arabi’s life can be divided into three discrete phases: born in Medinat Mursiya the present day [[Murcia]] in south-eastern Spain in 560AH/[[1165]]AD, he spent the first thirty-five years of his life in the [[Maghreb]], the western lands of [[Islam]] which stretched from [[al-Andalus]] to [[Tunis]]; then he embarked on [[pilgrimage]] and spent the next three years in or around [[Mecca]], where a series of dramatic experiences initiated the writing of several works including his magnum opus, the Meccan Illuminations ; the final phase of his life was spent in the [[Levant]] and [[Anatolia]], where he raised a family, and in addition to an unceasing literary output and instruction given to numerous disciples, he became adviser to kings and rulers. He settled in [[Damascus]], where he lived for 17 years. His writings are firmly based upon the Quran and the Sunna of the Prophet, although some recent scholars have claimed that he converted to Shiism in Damascus but concealed his faith.<ref>al-Qawl al-Matin fi Tashayyu' Shaykh Muhyi al-Din ibn Arabi by Tahrani</ref> He died in 638AH/[[1240]]AD and his tomb is still an important place of pilgrimage.

<blockquote>
It is reported in Muslim's Sahih that the Messenger of God said: 'God is beautiful and He loves beauty'. It is God who made the world and endowed it with existence. the entire universe is therefore supremely beautiful. There is nothing ugly in it. On the contrary, in it God has brought together all perfection and all beauty... The gnostics see it as being nothing other than the form of the Divine Beauty... for God is He who is revealed in every face, He to whom every sign refers back, He upon whom all eyes rest, He who is worshipped in every object of worship and pursued in the unseen and the visible world. The whole universe offers up its prayers to Him, falls down before Him, and sings His Praises. All tongues speak of Him alone, and Him alone all hearts desire... If it were not so, no Messenger nor Prophet would ever have loved woman or child (''Futuhat al-makkiyya'', III, pp.449-50)
</blockquote>

{{cquote|If you see a Prophet speaking a language outside the simple ordinances of the Shari'a, that is due to the fact that he is a wali and a knower of Allah. For this reason, his station in respect to his being a man of knowledge and a wali is more perfect and complete than it is due to the fact that he is a Messenger or someone who legislates and has a Shari'a. If you hear one of the People of Allah speaking, or it is related to you that he said, "Wilaya is higher than prophethood," that speaker only means what we mentioned. Or if he says that the wali is above the Prophet or the Messenger, he means in the same person. He is the Messenger, and inasmuch as he is a wali, he is more complete than he is by simply being a Prophet. It does not mean that the wali who follows him is higher than him. The follower never overtakes the followed in that in which he follows him. If he had overtaken him, then he would not be his follower. So understand that!|30px|30px|Fusus ul Hikam | Ibn Arabi}}

== His doctrine ==
A profound visionary capacity, coupled with a remarkable intellectual insight into human experience and a thorough comprehension of all the traditional sciences, marks out Ibn Arabi from comparable figures in Islam. It has been tempting for scholars to characterise him as a mystical philosopher, a formulation which is rather at odds with his own teachings on the limitations of philosophical thinking. He was as much at home with [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] scholarship as with medieval philology and letter symbolism, philosophy, alchemy and cosmology. He could write with equal facility in prose or poetry, and utilised the polysemous ambiguity of the Arabic language to great effect. The characteristic resonances of [[rhymed prose]] (saj’), which are to be found in the [[Qur'an]], abound in his works.

In recent years Western scholars such as [[William Chittick]] and [[Michel Chodkiewicz]] have begun to explore the radical way in which Ibn Arabi’s thought is underpinned and inspired by the revelation of the [[Qur'an]]. He adopts the rich vocabulary of spiritual phenomenology which previous mystics had built up, and gives it both a scriptural basis and an ontological root.

This all-inclusiveness and flexibility equally make him one of the most demanding of authors, and one whose subtlety lesser minds have often struggled to comprehend, some falling into rejection and outright opposition. He combines a detailed architecture of spiritual experience, theory and practice, with descriptions of the attainments of other masters he met as well as his own personal visions, insights and dreams. It is his propensity to recount stories from his own direct experience, primarily in order to make a teaching point, that allows readers to gain such a detailed insight into the inner world of one of the greatest mystics the world has known, and also allows us to reconstruct his life and times with some accuracy.

== Orthodox Criticism and its Defence ==

Some Sunnis reject the notion that Ibn Arabi was a Muslim. Reasons for Ibn Arabi being branded a heretic were some of his statements in his books such as "Fusoos Al-Hikam" and "Al-Ahkaam". One example is where Ibn Arabi said, " العبد رب و الرب عبد Al-`Abdu Rabbun Warrabbu `Abdun" meaning The slave (human) is the Lord and the Lord is the slave." Sufis claim that such statements were always considered to be the most elevated exposition of mystical thought in Islam, and therefore unsuitable for the untrained mind. Ibn Arabi has also said, " الرب رب في التنزل والعبد عبد فى الترقي Al-Rabbu Rabbun Fa in tanazzal, wal abdu abdun fa in tarakka" (Lord is Lord through his coming down in love to His creations and a slave is a slave however high in status he goes up). This clearly shows that he accepted the existence of creations.

=== Its defence ===
The Shaikh wrote his books in the Arabic used by highly literate persons.  He also made heavy use of terminologies.  This was common for all Sufi masters, but they first taught their students the basics before handing them their books.  They also burned most of their works before death, fearing that the later untrained generations might misunderstand them.  His book Fusoos Al-Hikam, for example, came under heavy fire and he was declared Kafir by many scholars.  This book was translated into many languages.

== د فصوص الحکم ژباړې او په هغه تبصرې ==
There have been many exceptional commentaries on Ibn 'Arabi's Fusus al-hikam: the first called al-Fukuk was written by his stepson and heir, [[Sadruddin al-Qunawi]], who had studied the book with Ibn 'Arabi; the second by Qunawi's student, Mu'ayyad al-din [[al-Jandi]], which was the first line-by-line commentary; the third by Jandi's student, [[Da'ud al-Qaysari]], which became very influential in the Persian-speaking world. There were many others, in the Ottoman world (eg 'Abd Allah Bosnevi), the Arab world (eg 'Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulusi) and the Persian world (eg Haydar Amoli). It is estimated that there are over 50 commentaries on the Fusus, most of which only exist in manuscript form. The more famous (such as [[Qunawi]]'s Fukuk) have been printed in recent years in Iran.

The Fusus was first critically edited in Arabic by Afifi (1946). The first English translation was done in partial form by Angela Culme-Seymour from the French translation of Titus Burckhardt as "Wisdom of the Prophets" (1975), and the first full translation was by Ralph Austin as "Bezels of Wisdom" (1980). There is also a complete French translation by Charles-Andre Gilis, entitled "Le livre des chatons des sagesses" (1997). The only commentary to have been translated into English so far is entitled "Ismail Hakki Bursevi's translation and commentary on Fusus al-hikam by Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi" in 4 volumes (1985-1991). 

In Urdu, the most authentic translation is supposed to be that of [[Maulvi Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui]].  His translation is in the curriculum of Punjab University.  He has made an interpretive translation and explained the terms and grammar while clarifying the Shaikh's opinions.
