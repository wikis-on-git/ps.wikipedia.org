'''هرم''' (جمع: اهرام)، هغه اريانوونكي لرغوني جوړښتونه دي، چې د نن ورځې ساينس او ټكنالوجي يې ځان پورې اريانه كړې ده، او تردې دمه پورې څوك پدې ندي توانېدلي، چې دا مالومه كړي، چې آيا دا د انسانانو كار ؤ، او كه د كوم بل خلايي مخلوق. 
اهرام د هغو درې ضلعي څو مخيزه جوړښتونو څڅه عبارت دى، چې د يوځاى كېدو محور يې  په يوه ټكي باندې ولاړ وي.  
د اهرام بنسټ كېداى شي، چې څوضلعي وي، يا به څلور ضلعي وي، او يا هم درې ضلعي. 

ډېرى لوديځ زمكپوهان او انسانپوهان پدې ګروهه دي، چې دا ودانۍ د انسان جوړونه نه ده، بلكه د كوم بلې سيارې د مخلوق جوړونه ده. 

دا اهرام د لرغونې پير د ساينسي پرمختګ يو ښه ثبوت ګڼلې شو.  ددې ډبرينو جوړښتونو شكلونو په تېرو ۱۰۰۰ كلونو څخه راپدېخوا د نړۍ پوهان، فيلسوفان، صوفيان او ستورپوهان لپاره د بحث او مباحثې يوه ګرمه موضوع جوړه شوې ده.  ددې پوهانو د بحث اصل موضوع د مصر نامتو هرم [[چيوپس]] دى.  د ډبرو دا غونډۍ له زرګونو كلونو څخه راپدېخوا د انساني ذهنونو او ادراكو لپاره يوه نه حل كېدونكې معما او چلېنج جوړ شوې.

[[انڅور:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|کيڼ|thumb|300px|د [[مصر]] لرغوني اهرام]]

The most famous pyramids are the [[مصري اهرام]] &mdash; huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest man-made constructions. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally "place of ascendance."  The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. Until [[Lincoln Cathedral]] was built in 1300 A.D., it was the tallest building in the world. The base is over 13 [[acre]]s in area.

It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt|لرغوني مصريان]] capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, though many of the stones used for the purpose have fallen or been removed for other structures.

There is a Roman era [[French pyramids|pyramid]] built in [[Falicon]], France. There were many more pyramids made in France in this period.

[[Image:Pyramide von Hellinikon.jpg|thumb|left|279px|Pyramid of Hellinikon]]

There are several structures in Greece that archaeologists have called pyramids.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  Dotted throughout the landscape are remains of buildings that were described by ancient travelers as pyramids, they were first excavated by Americans and Germans in the early 1930s and the 1990s.
    
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek traveler in the second century A.D. described several of the structures as pyramids.  One of these pyramids was located in [[Pyramid of Hellinikon|Hellenikon]], Ελληνικό in Greek,a village near [[Argos]] near the ancient ruins of Tiryns.<ref> Helleniko Pyramid  http://www.grecoreport.com/pyramids_in_ancient_greece.htm</ref>  The story surrounding the monument was that it was built as a polyandria, a common grave, for those soldiers who had fallen in the struggle for the throne of Argos back in the 14th Century B.C.  He described the structure as something that resembled a pyramid with the decorations of Argolic shields, showing the military connection to it.  Another pyramid that Pausanias saw on his journeys was at Kenchreai, another polyandria dedicated to the Argives and Spartans who lost their lives at the Battle of Hysiai in 669 B.C.  Unfortunately neither of these structures remain fully intact today to test how closely they resembled the pyramids of [[Egypt]] nor is there any proof that they even resembled an Egyptian pyramid at all.

There are two surviving pyramid-like structures still available to study, one at Helleniko and the other at Ligourio, a village near the ancient theatre Epidaurus.  With these two pyramid’s base stones remaining, it is possible to determine that Grecian pyramids existed, but were not used as the Egyptians used them.   These buildings were not constructed in the same manner as the pyramids in Egypt.  The buildings at Helleniko and Ligourio were no more than 100 feet tall and were surrounded by walls, with the base of the Helleniko pyramid being nine meters by 7 meters.  The stone used to build the pyramids was limestone quarried locally and was cut to fit, not into freestanding blocks like the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].  The base of the structures also differed from the Egyptian pyramids as they were rectangular, not square.  This simple construction shape made it very difficult to make the top of the building come together in a point.  As such, it makes more sense that these structures could have been peaked by a roof or platform.

There are no remains or graves in or near the structures.  Instead, the rooms that the walls housed were made to be locked from the inside.  This coupled with the platform roof, means that one of the functions these structures could have served was as watchtowers.  Another possibility for the buildings is that they are shrines to heroes and soldiers of ancient times, but the lock on the inside makes no sense for such a purpose.   

The dating of these ‘pyramids’ has been made from the pot shards excavated from the floor and on the grounds. The latest dates available from scientific dating have been estimated around the 5th and 4th centuries. There are many researchers who have given dates to the structures that pre-date the pyramids at Giza, but the method to obtain these dates was thermoluminescence of the stone.  Normally this technique is used for dating pottery, but here researchers have used it to try and date stone flakes from the walls of the structures.  This has created some debate about whether or not these ‘pyramids’ are actually older than Egypt, which is part of the Black Athena controversy.  The basis for their use of thermoluminescence in order to date these structures is a new method of collecting samples for testing.  Scientists from laboratories hired out by the recent excavators of the site, The Academy of Athens, say that they can use the electrons trapped on the inner surface of the stones to positively identify the date that the stones were quarried and put together. 

The issue with this method is that they date the pyramids with a margin of error of up to over 700 years.  This method dated the Helleniko pyramid to 2730 B.C. with an error factor of plus or minus 720 years.  It also dated the Ligourio pyramid to 2260 B.C. with an error of plus or minus 710 years.  Though these initial dates are indicative of these structures being built before the pyramid complex at Giza, it also means that they could have been built well after Khufu’s Great Pyramid was erected.  Some archaeologists, however, have indicated that these samples may have been very select in their choice of which stones to sample.  Further excavations of the site at Helleniko reveal that it was constructed on a previously existing structure, giving a possibility that the new methods of dating may be a misinterpretation.

Along with these two structures there are 14 more pyramid-like buildings, or their remains, scattered throughout the rest of the country side of Greece.  These sites do not get as much attention as the two at Helleniko and Ligourio as they are the only ones mentioned in surviving accounts of ancient travelers.

Many giant [[granite]] temple pyramids were made in [[South India]] during the [[Chola Empire]], many of which are still in religious use today. Examples of such pyramid temples include [[Brihadisvara Temple]] at [[Thanjavur]], the [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram|Temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram]] and the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at [[Darasuram]]. However the largest temple pyramid in the area is [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Rangam]] in [[Srirangam|Srirangam, Tamil Nadu]]. The Brihadisvara Temple was declared by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] in [[1987]]; the Temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram were added as extensions to the site in [[2004]].[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2004/whc04-28com-inf14ae.pdf]

===Mesoamerican pyramids===

[[Image:Piramide del Sol 072006.JPG|thumb|left|Pyramid of the Sun on the city of [[Teotihuacán]], [[Mexico]]]]

A number of [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures also built pyramid-shaped structures.  [[Mesoamerican pyramids]]  were usually stepped, with temples on top, more similar to the Mesopotamian ziggurat than the Egyptian pyramid.  The largest pyramid by volume is the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula]], in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Puebla]]. This pyramid is considered the largest monument ever constructed anywhere in the world, and is still being excavated. There is an unusual pyramid with a circular plan at the site of [[Cuicuilco]], now inside [[Mexico City]] and mostly covered with lava from an ancient eruption of [[Xictli]]. Pyramids in Mexico were often used as places of human sacrifice.

===Mesopotamian pyramids===

The [[Mesopotamia]]ns also built pyramids, called [[ziggurat]]s.  In ancient times these were brightly painted.  Since they were constructed of mud-brick, little remains of them.  The Biblical [[Tower of Babel]] is believed to have been a [[Babylon]]ian ziggurat.

===د شمال امريكا اهرام===

Many [[Mound builder (people)|mound-building]] societies of ancient [[North America]] built large pyramidal earth structures known as [[platform mound]]s.  Among the largest and best-known of these structures is [[Monk's Mound]] at the site of [[Cahokia]], which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza.  While the North American mounds' precise function is not known, they are believed to have played a central role in the mound-building people's religious life.

===Nubian pyramids===

[[Nubian pyramids]] were constructed (roughly 220 of them) at three sites in Nubia to serve as tombs for the kings and queens of Napata and Meroë.

The [[Nubians]] built more pyramids than the [[Egyptians]], but they are smaller.  The [[Nubian pyramids]] were constructed at a steeper angle than Egyptian ones and were monuments to dead kings{{Fact|date=August 2007}}.

Pyramids were still being built in Nubia up to AD 300.

[[Image:Roma-Piramide cestia01.jpg|thumb|left|Pyramid of Cestius.]]

The 27-meter-high [[Pyramid of Cestius]] was built by the end of the first century BC and still exists today, close to the [[Porta San Paolo]]. Another one, named ''Meta Romuli'', standing in the ''Ager Vaticanus'' (today's [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]), was destroyed at the end of the [[15th century]].

These Roman imitations of Egyptian monuments are important as contemporary "portraits" of the Egyptian ones, providing some sense of their original color and smoothness.

==Medieval Europe==

Pyramids have occasionally been used in Christian architecture of the feudal era, e.g. as the tower of [[Oviedo]]'s Gothic [[Cathedral of San Salvador (Oviedo)|Cathedral of San Salvador]]. In some cases this leads to speculations on [[masonic]] or other symbolical intentions.

Examples of modern pyramids are:

* The [[Louvre Pyramid]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], in the court of the [[Louvre]] Museum, is a 20.6 meter (about 70 foot) glass structure which acts as an entrance to the museum. It was designed by the American architect [[I. M. Pei]] and completed in 1989.
* The [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in San Francisco, California, designed by [[William Pereira]].
* The 32-story [[Pyramid Arena]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] (built in 1991) was the home court for the [[University of Memphis]] men's [[basketball]] program, and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Memphis Grizzlies]] until 2004.
* The [[Slovensky rozhlas|Slovak radio]] building in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. This building is shaped like an inverted pyramid. <!-- Like the Tempe, Arizona city hall -->

* The [[Summum Pyramid]], a 3 story pyramid in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], used for instruction in the [[Summum]] philosophy and conducting rites associated with Modern Mummification.
* The [[Palace of Peace and Reconciliation]] in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]].
* The three pyramids of [[Moody Gardens]] in [[Galveston]], [[Texas]].
* The Co-Op Bank Pyramid or Stockport Pyramid in [[Stockport]], [[England]] is a large pyramid-shaped [[office block]] in [[Stockport]] in England. (The surrounding part of the valley of the upper [[Mersey]] has sometimes been called the "Kings Valley" after the [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[Egypt]].)
* The GoJa Music Hall in [[Prague]].
* The [[Muttart Conservatory]] greenhouses in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]].
* The unfinished [[Ryugyong Hotel]] in [[Pyongyang]].
