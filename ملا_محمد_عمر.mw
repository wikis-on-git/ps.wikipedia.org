'''محمد عمر''' (زېږېدنه، ۱۹۵۹-) چې د '''ملا محمد عمر''' او يا هم په ساده توګه د '''ملا عمر''' په نامه يادېږي، په افغانستان کې د طالبانو د غورځنګ مشر دی. نوموړی چې اوس په يوه نامالومه ځای کې پټ دی له ۱۹۹۶ زېږيز کال نه تر ۲۰۰۱ کې د افغانستان د حکومت هغه مشر وه چې په ولسواکيزه توګه نه وه ټاکل شوی. د هغه پلويان ښاغلی عمر ته د اميرالمومنين خطاب کوي او دا لقب يې دده د پلويانو لخوا په ۱۹۹۴ زېږيز کال کې ورته ورکړ شوی.

ملا محمد عمر د ۲۰۰۱ زېږيز کال نه راپدېخوا، کله چې امريکايانو په افغانستان کې جګړه پيل کړې ده په يوه نامالومه ځای کې پټ دی. ملا عمر هغه کس دی چې امريکا يې د نيولو په لټون بوخته ده او غواړي چې دی او د القاعدې د ډلې مشران او نور غړي ونيسي. نوموړی په ۲۰۰۱ کال کې د نيويارک په سوداګريزو مرکزونو په بريدونو کې د لاس لرلو او د اسامه بن لادن او د القاعدې د ترهګرې ډلې د غړو د نه سپارلو په خاطر تورن کړی دی. داسې اټکل کېږي چې ملا عمر د افغانستان او پاکستان د پولې تر مېنځ په قبايلي غره ايزو سيمو کې پټ دی.

==Overview==

For a man who served as the head of state of a nation of 25 million people, remarkably little is known about him. By his own account, Omar has never flown on an airplane and has left his native Afghanistan only once, to travel briefly to the tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan. Omar has given few interviews, rarely met with non-[[Muslim]]s, and there are few known pictures of him. Diplomats describe him as shy and untalkative with foreigners. During his rule, almost all contact with the outside world was carried out by his foreign minister [[Wakil Ahmad Mutawakkil]].

==شخصي ژوند==
Omar is an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and is described as very tall (some say 1.98 m or 6'6", though this may be exaggerated). He was born the son of a peasant farmer, and grew up in mud huts around the village of [[Singesar]] (or, by some reports, [[Nodeh]]), near [[Kandahar]]. His father died when Mohammed was still young and the responsibility of fending for his family fell to him. He is reported to be married to [[Osama bin Laden]]'s daughter and have five children that are studying in the [[madrasah]] run by Omar.  This report has not been confirmed, and some believe that it is a rumor intended to explain why Omar allowed bin Laden to stay in Afghanistan. {{fact}}

==Soviet Invasion and radicalisation==
Omar was a guerilla warrior with the ''[[Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami]]'' faction of the anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mujahideen]]. He was wounded four times and lost one eye in an explosion. Taliban lore has it that, upon being wounded by a piece of shrapnel, Omar removed his own eye and sewed the eyelid shut. However, reports from a [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] facility near the Pakistan border indicate that Omar was treated there for the injury, where his eye was surgically removed.

After he was disabled, Omar may have studied and taught in a madrasah, or Islamic seminary, in the Pakistani border city of [[Quetta]] (he actually studied in a madrasah in city of Multan in Punjab Pakistan). He was reportedly a [[mullah]] at a village madrasah near the Afghan city of Kandahar.

==د طالبانو د غورځنګ جوړول==
Following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in [[1989]] and the collapse of the Communist regime in Kabul in [[1992]], the country fell into anarchy as various mujahideen factions fought for control. Omar came to head a group of warriors known as the Taliban, or Students. His recruits came from the [[Qur'an]]ic schools within Afghanistan and in the Afghan [[refugee]] camps across the border in Pakistan. They fought against the rampant [[corruption]] that had emerged in the [[civil war]] period and were initially welcomed by Afghans weary of [[warlord]] rule. 

Reportedly <ref>{{cite news|publisher=Reuters|date=[[2001-09-20]]|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_story_skin/57491|accessdate=2006-07-02|title=The mysterious Mullah behind the Taliban}}</ref>, in early 1994, Omar led 30 men armed with 16 rifles to free two girls who had been kidnapped and raped by local commanders. His movement gained momentum through the year, and he quickly gathered recruits from Islamic schools. By November 1994, Omar's movement managed to capture the province of [[Kandahar]].

==د طالبانو لارښود==
In April [[1996]], supporters of Mullah Omar bestowed on him the title ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' (أمير المؤمنين, "Commander of the Faithful"<ref>[http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=860 Messages by Al-Qaeda Operatives in Afghanistan to the Peoples of the West] "... alongside the Emir of the Believers..." September 2005</ref>), after he supposedly took the cloak of the [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] out of a series of chests it was locked in, which were held in a shrine in Kandahar. Legend decreed that whoever could retrieve the cloak from the chests would be the great Leader of the Muslims, or "Amir al-Mu'minin" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/12/19/MN37470.DTL|title="Kandahar residents feel betrayed"|last=Healy|first=Patrick|publisher=Boston Globe|date=[[2001-12-19]]|accessdate=2006-07-02}}</ref>.  Shortly afterwards, [[Kabul]] fell to Mullah Omar and his followers in 1996. 

Mullah Omar renamed his subjected country the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] in October [[1997]]. However, he did not move to [[Kabul]], which has been the capital of Afghanistan for several centuries. In fact, he only visited Kabul twice during the reign of the Taliban from 1996 to 2001. Instead, Omar preferred to rule from his base in Kandahar.

Under Mullah Omar, Taliban authorities enforced a particularly strict version of Islamic Law (the [[Sharia]] or Path). The only professions open to women were in the field of medicine, and the women working as doctors or nurses could only treat other women. Women were also not permitted to attend co-educational schools; in practice, this prevented the vast majority of young women and girls in Afghanistan from receiving even a [[primary education]]. A stringent interpretation of the Islamic dress code, specifically the [[Hijab]] or Veil, was enforced: women could not leave the house without a [[burqa]]. Men were forced to grow beards and avoid non-Islamic haircuts or dress. Cinemas were closed and music banned. Theft was punished by the amputation of a hand, rape and murder by public execution. Married adulterers were stoned to death. In Kabul, punishments were carried out in front of crowds in the city's former [[soccer stadium]].  Hundreds of cultural artifacts were also destroyed including major museum and countless private art collections.  Mullah Mohammad Omar defended his order saying it was an honor for Islam, despite international outcries, particularly with regard to the destruction of the world's largest and amongst the oldest buddhist statues, at Bamiyan.

On [[15 November]] [[2001]], Mohammad Omar proclaimed,{{cquote|All Taliban are moderate. There are two things: extremism ["ifraat", or doing something to excess] and conservatism ["tafreet", or doing something insufficiently]. So in that sense, we are all moderates - taking the middle path.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1657368.stm On whether moderate Taliban will join the new Afghani government]''BBC News'' [[15 November]] [[2001]]</ref>}}

==د ۲۰۰۱ کال نه وروسته==
Since the international intervention Afghanistan began in 2001, Omar has been hiding in unknown location(s) in the Pashtun regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan and is still at large. The United States government is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his capture. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/wanted_captured/index.cfm?page=MullahOmar|work=Rewards for Justice|title=WANTED Mullah Omar Up to $10 Million Reward|accessdate=2006-07-02}}</ref>

In June [[2006]], a statement was released, supposedly from Mullah Omar, regarding the death of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] in Iraq. The statement hailed al-Zarqawi as a [[martyr]] and claimed that the [[resistance movement]]s in Afghanistan and [[Iraq]] "will not be weakened". <ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-06-09|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5062964.stm|accessdate=2006-07-02|title=Taleban play down Zarqawi death}}</ref>

Omar is believed to have played a significant role in the ending of the [[Waziristan War]] between Waziri Pashtuns and the government of Pakistan in September, 2006. He continues to have the allegiance of prominent pro-Taliban military leaders in the region, including [[Mullah Dadullah]] and [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. Former foe [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s faction has also reportedly allied with Omar and the Taliban.

In December [[2006]] Omar issued a statement expressing confidence that foreign forces will be driven out of Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=[[2006-12-31]]|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/News/Templates/Postings/DetailedPage.aspx?FRAMELESS=false&NRNODEGUID=%7b7C70CC1E-B445-4C62-8177-ACDD3A3EBB73%7d&NRORIGINALURL=%2fNR%2fexeres%2f7C70CC1E-B445-4C62-8177-ACDD3A3EBB73%2ehtm&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest|accessdate=2007-01-01|title=Mullah Omar issues Eid message}}</ref>

In [[January]] [[2007]] a captured Taliban spokesman, [[Muhammad Hanif]], told Afghani authorities Omar is being protected by the [[ISI]] in [[Quetta]], Pakistan. This matches an allegation made by the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, in [[2006]], though it is denied by officials in Pakistan.
