'''Burhanuddin Rabbani''' ([[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] ([[Persian language|Persian]]): {{lang|fa|برهان الدين رباني}} - ''Burhânuddîn Rabbânî'') (born [[1940]]), an ethnic [[Tajiks|Tajik]], is a former President of [[Afghanistan]]. Burhanuddin Rabbani is the leader of Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan (Islamic Society of Afghanistan). He also served as the political head of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan]] (UIFSA), an alliance of various political groups who fought against [[Taliban]] rule in Afghanistan. He served as President from 1992-1996 until he was forced to leave Kabul because of the Taliban takeover of the city. His government was recognized by many countries, as well as the [[United Nations]].

==Early years==
Rabbani, son of Muhammed Yousuf, was born in 1940 in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], a province of Afghanistan. After finishing school in his native province, he went to [[Darul-uloom-e-Sharia]] ([[Abu-Hanifa]]), a religious school in Kabul. When he graduated from Abu-Hanifa, he went to [[Kabul University]] to study Islamic Law and Theology. During his four years at Kabul University he became well known for his works on [[Islam]]. Soon after his graduation in 1963, he was hired as a [[Professor]] at [[Kabul University]]. In order to enhance his himself, Rabbani went to [[Egypt]] in 1966, and he entered the [[Al-Azhar]] University in Cairo. In two years, he received his [[masters degree]] in [[Islamic Philosophy]]. 

In 1968, Rabbani returned to Afghanistan, where the High Council of [[Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan]] gave him the duty of organizing the University students. Due to his knowledge, reputation, and active support for the cause of Islam, in 1972, a 15-member council selected him as head of Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan; the founder of Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan, [[Ghulam M. Niyazi]] was also present. 

In the spring of 1974, police cars came to Kabul University to arrest Rabbani for his pro-Islamic stance, but with the help of his students the police were unable to capture him, and he managed to escape to the country side. Later with his base in Pakistan, Rabbani managed to lead his party now evolved into a successful mujahideen fighting group to resist the Soviet Invasion. Rabbani's forces was the first mujahideen group to enter Kabul in 1992 and defeat the Communists.

== Later Years ==

After the war, Rabbani became the president of Afghanistan but fell out of favor with his former allies, the Taliban.  After four years of civil war, he was forced to flee Kabul as the Taliban took over the capital.  However, supported by an organization that became known as the Northern Alliance, Rabbani continued to resist his the new Afghan government, and the civil war continued.  After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he agreed to help American and Nato troops liberate Afghanistan from the Taliban.  With help from coalition troops, Kabul was soon captured and Rabbani became the first president.  Soon after, he relinquished control to Hamid Karzai and he is now a politician in Afghanistan.
