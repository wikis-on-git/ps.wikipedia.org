'''Burhanuddin Rabbani''' ('''برهان الدين رباني''') (born [[1940]]), an ethnic [[Tajiks|Tajik]], is a former President of Afghanistan and was political leader of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]].

In [[1992]] he became [[President]] of the Islamic Council of [[Afghanistan]] (and thus effective ruler of the country), until [[Kabul]] was captured by the [[Taliban]] in [[1996]]. He set up headquarters in the northern Afghan town of [[Faizabad (Badakhshan|Faizabad]] and led, with support from [[India]], [[Iran]], and [[Russia]], one of the five anti-Taliban factions.

He was still recognised as leader of [[Afghanistan]] by the [[United Nations]] and most other countries during the Taliban regime. Despite this most of the real power was held by his Ministers of Defence, first [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]] and later [[Mohammed Fahim]] after Massoud's assassination. When the [[United States]] and its allies deposed the Taliban in [[2001]], Rabbani retook the capital and proclaimed himself to be Afghanistan's legitimate [[Head of State]]. He formally handed over power to an interim government headed by [[Hamid Karzai]] on [[December 22]], [[2001]]. 

In [[2004]] he attended Karzai's formal inauguration as Afghanistan's first elected president. In [[2005]] he was elected to the Afghan Parliament.

In a document published by the [[Human Rights Watch]] by the title of “Blood-Stained Hands: Past Atrocities in [[Kabul]] and [[Afghanistan]]’s Legacy of Impunity,” on July 7, 2005, [http://hrw.org/reports/2005/afghanistan0605/], "[[Jamiat-e-Islami]]-yi Afghanistan, a predominately Tajik faction led politically by Burhanuddin Rabbani and commanded militarily by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (killed in a suicide attack on September 9, 2001)" is regarded prime suspect groups and leaders involved in the documented abuses in the bloody years of 1992-96 in [[Afghanistan]].
