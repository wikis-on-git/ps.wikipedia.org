== د خواړو منابع ==
نژدې ټول خواړه د بوټو او ژويو نه ترلاسه کېږي، که څه هم چې پدې کې ځينې استثناګانې هم شته. نژدې هر يو ژوندی که هغه بوټي وي او که هغه ژوي وي، د يو يا بل ژوندي د خوړلو برخه جوړوي، او دا خواړه يا د برار او ژوند کولو په خاطر او يا هم د مذهبي او فرهڼيزو دودونو او شګومونو له مخې د يوه او يا هم د ډېرو انساني ټولنو لخوا خوړل کېږي.

=== هغه خواړه چې د بوټو نه ترلاسه کېږي ===
[[دوتنه:Foods.jpg|thumbnail|right|د بوټو نه لاس ته راغلي خواړه]]
انسانان د بوټو ډېرۍ برخې د خوړو په توګه کاروي. پدې کې د بوټو نژدې دوه زره بېلابېل توکمونه د خوړو لپاره کرل کېږي، او ډېری يې زمونږ د ورځنيو چارو خواړه دي چې د بېلابېلو فصلونو نه لاس ته راځي. د بوټو نه لاس ته راغلي خواړه په لانديني ټولګيو وېشل کېږي:
[[ځڼي]]، , the ripened [[ovule]]s of some plants, carry a plant [[embryo]] inside them along with the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth. Because of this, seeds are often packed with energy, and are good sources of food for animals, including humans. In fact, the majority of all foods consumed by human beings are seeds. These include [[cereal]]s (such as [[maize]], [[wheat]], and [[rice]]), [[legume]]s (such as [[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[lentil]]s), and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. [[Oilseed]]s are often pressed to produce rich oils, including [[sunflower]], [[rapeseed|rape]] (including [[canola oil]]), and [[sesame]].<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&vid=ISBN0684800012&pg=PA451&lpg=PA451&sig=lcasRT_dAcTctAePtBu5j_ybSIY ibid]'', Chapter 9: Seeds: Grains, Legumes, and Nuts.</ref>

[[پياز]]

[[Fruit]]s are the ripened [[ovary|ovaries]] of plants, including the seeds within. Fruits are made attractive to animals so that animals will eat the fruits and [[excretion|excrete]] the seeds over long distances. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some fruits, such as pumpkin and eggplant, are eaten as vegetables.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&vid=ISBN0684800012&pg=PA350&lpg=350&sig=lcasRT_dAcTctAePtBu5j_ybSIY ibid]'', Chapter 7: A Survey of Common Fruits.</ref> (For more information, see [[list of fruits]].)

سابه د بوټو نه لاس ته راغلي توکي دي چې د خواړو په توګه کارېږي. په سابو کې د بوټو ريښې لکه کچالو او ګازرې، د بوټو پاڼې لکه پالک او کاهو، د بوټو ډډونه لکه اسپراګس او پښۍ او په آخر کې د بوټو ګلان، لکه ګلپي او شين ګلپي يا براکولي، دا ټول سابه يادېږي. ډېرۍ مسالۍ، داروګان او خوند بسيا کوونکي توکي چې د خوند، درملنې او وږم لپاره د خواړو په ډول کارېږي، دا ټول د بوټو نه لاس ته راځي.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&vid=ISBN0684800012&pg=PA300&lpg=300&sig=lcasRT_dAcTctAePtBu5j_ybSIY ibid]'', Chapter 6: A Survey of Common Vegetables.</ref>

په ډېرو فرهڼونو کې ګبين چې د شاتو د مچيو نه په لاس راځي هم د خوړو په توګه کارېږي.

=== نور خواړه ===
ځينې خواړه داسې دي چې نه يې ژوي او نه هم بوټي د لاسته راوړنې سرچينه ګڼل کېږي. دغه ډول خواړه د خوړنده فنجای نه لاس ته راځي چې په هغو کې مرخېړي شامل دي. په همدې توګه د فنجای او روغتيا ته ځيان نه رسونکي باکټېريا هم د خواړو د تخمير کولو په لارو چارو کې کارول کېږي، لکه د اچارو جوړول، ډوډۍ پخول، د الکولي څښاکونو په جوړولو کې، د مستو، شړومبو، او پنېر په جوړولو کې له دغو نومېدلو سرچينو نه کار اخيستل کېږي.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&vid=ISBN0684800012&pg=PA713&lpg=713&sig=lcasRT_dAcTctAePtBu5j_ybSIY ibid]'', Chapter 13: Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits.</ref> Many cultures eat [[seaweed]], which is a [[protist]], or [[Blue-green algae|blue-green algae (cyanobacteria)]] such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]].<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&vid=ISBN0684800012&pg=PA333&lpg=333&sig=lcasRT_dAcTctAePtBu5j_ybSIY ibid]'', pp. 333-334.</ref> Additionally, [[edible salt|salt]] is often eaten as a flavoring or preservative, and [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] is used in food preparation.

{{main|Cooking}}
The term "cooking" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to improve the [[flavor|flavour]] or [[digestion|digestibility of food]]. It generally requires the selection, measurement and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual cooking.<ref name=McGee14 />

The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural and religious considerations that impact upon it.<ref name=Mead />

{{main|Food manufacture}}
Packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a [[butcher]] preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international [[food industry]].

Early food processing techniques were limited by available [[food preservation]], packaging and [[transport]]ation. This mainly involved [[salting (food)|salting]], [[curing]], curdling, [[drying (food)|drying]], [[pickling]] and [[smoking (food)|smoking]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Aguilera |first=Jose Miguel |coauthors=Stanley, David W |title= Microstructural Principles of Food Processing and Engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0834212560&id=nIeJiL_dLeQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&sig=bzmlLhTRqbOWxZQPBdcAtcW_4DY |date=[[January 1]] [[1999]] |publisher=Springer |id= ISBN 0-8342-1256-0 |pages=pp. 1-3}}</ref>

=== Food retailing ===

In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day, into the local [[village]] [[market place]]. Here food was sold to [[grocer]]s for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.<ref name=Mead /><ref name=Jango-Cohen/>

With the onset of industrialisation, and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be [[counter]]-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.<ref name=Mead /><ref>{{cite book |last=Benson |first=Susan Porter |title=Counter Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American Department Stores, 1890-1940 |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN025206013X&id=HX01Ls3-PAIC |date=July 11, 2005 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |id= ISBN 0-8225-2484-8}}</ref>

In the 20th century [[supermarket]]s were born. Supermarkets brought with them a [[self service]] approach to shopping using [[shopping cart]]s, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through [[economies of scale]] and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionised by the development of vast [[warehouse]]-sized out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.<ref>{{cite book |last=Humphery |first=Kim |title=Shelf Life: Supermarkets and the Changing Cultures of Consumption |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521626307&id=kGHPdeIdvbkC |date=July 27, 1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |id= ISBN 0-521-62630-7}}</ref>

Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large [[Corporation|companies]] control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers.<ref name=oligopolywatch /> Nevertheless, less than ten percent of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to [[advertising]], [[transportation]], and intermediate corporations.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Magdoff, Fred; Foster, John Bellamy; and Buttel, Frederick H.  |title=Hungry for Profit: The Agribusiness Threat to Farmers, Food, and the Environment |month=September |year=2000 |url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/hfpintro.htm |publisher= |id= ISBN 1-58367-016-5 |quote=[T]he farmer's share of the food dollar (after paying for input costs) has steadily declined from about 40 percent in 1910 to less than 10 percent in 1990.}}</ref>

Food deprivation leads to [[malnutrition]] and ultimately [[starvation]]. This is often connected with [[famine]], which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality.

[[Food aid]] can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. It can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required.<ref>{{cite web

[[Foodborne illness]], commonly called "food poisoning," is caused by [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[toxin]]s, [[virus]]es, [[parasite]]s, and [[prion]]s. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite encyclopedia

The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as 'foreign bodies') during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.<ref name=MedlinePlus />

[[Food poisoning]] has been recognised as a disease of man since as early as [[Hippocrates]].<ref>[[Hippocrates]], [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_acute_diseases On Acute Diseases].</ref> The sale of [[Rancidity|rancid]], contaminated or adulterated food was commonplace until introduction of [[hygiene]], refrigeration, and [[vermin]] controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing [[bacterium|bacteria]] using [[heat]] and other [[microbiology|microbiological]] studies by scientists such as [[Louis Pasteur]] contributed to the modern sanitation standards that we enjoy today. This was further underpinned by the work of [[Justus von Liebig]] whose work led to the development of modern [[food storage]] and [[food preservation]] methods.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0824708245&id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |date=August 1, 2002 |publisher=Marcel Dekker |id= ISBN |pages=Chapter 7, pp. 243-498}}</ref> In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as [[HACCP]], which can identify and eliminate many risks.<ref>{{cite web

==== Food allergies ====
{{main|food allergy}}

Some people have [[allergy|allergies]] or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's [[immune system]] mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy.<ref name=allergy>{{cite book

  | id =  }}</ref> The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a susceptible individual can be minute. For instance, tiny amounts of food in the air, too minute to be smelled, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in sufficiently sensitive individuals. Commonly food allergens are [[gluten]], corn, shellfish (mollusks), [[peanut]]s, and [[soy]]. Most patients present with [[diarrhea]] after ingesting certain foodstuffs, skin symptoms ([[rash]]es), bloating, [[vomit]]ing and [[regurgitation]]. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the [[allergen]].<ref name=allergy />

Rarely, food allergy can lead to [[anaphylactic shock]]: [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) and loss of consciousness. This is a [[medical emergency]]. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is [[peanut]], although [[latex]] products can induce similar reactions.<ref name=allergy /> Initial treatment is with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an [[Epi-pen]].<ref>[http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx About Epipen], Epipen.com</ref>

=== Dietary habits ===
{{main|Diet (nutrition)}}
Dietary habits are the habitual decisions an individual or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. Although humans are [[omnivore]]s, each culture holds some food preferences and some food [[taboo]]s.<ref>{{cite book | author=Allen, Stewart Lee | title=In the Devil's Garden: A Sinful History of Forbidden Food | id=ISBN 0-345-44015-3}}</ref> Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in [[religion]]. For example, only [[Kashrut|Kosher foods]] are permitted by [[Judaism]], and [[Halal/Haram foods]] by [[Islam]], in the diet of believers.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simoons, Frederick J. | title=Eat Not This Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present | id=ISBN 0-299-14250-7}}</ref> In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's [[cuisine]].

Dietary habits play a significant role in the [[health]] and [[mortality]] of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of [[adipose]] tissue, known as body fat.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nicklas |first=Barbara J. |title=Endurance Exercise and Adipose Tissue |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0849304601&id=cLN21bT498QC |date=January 1, 2002 |publisher=CRC Press |id= ISBN 0-8493-0460-1}}</ref> Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to [[diseases]] which can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, [[Iodine deficiency]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Merson |first=Michael H. |coauthors=Black, Robert E.; Mills, Anne J. |title=International Public Health: Disease, Programs, Systems, and Policies |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0763728748&id=Yg9pC2-qE0EC&pg=PA245&lpg=PA245&sig=ha_CpQHJjTMmjC9DQJuVKsE5LLU |date=January 1, 2005 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |id= ISBN |pages=pp. 245}}</ref> It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to [[vitamin A]] deficiency.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0763728748&id=Yg9pC2-qE0EC&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&sig=akNUr17ECuf4u2xA5CGvKCgARzQ ibid]'', pp. 231.</ref> [[Vitamin C]] deficiency results in [[scurvy]].<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0763728748&id=Yg9pC2-qE0EC&pg=PA464&lpg=PA464&sig=y_08tyz_4p-cRwcR0H5EEsmTM5Q ibid]'', pp. 464.</ref> [[Calcium]], [[Vitamin D]] and [[Phosphorus]] are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others.

Many individuals choose to limit what foods the eat for reasons of health, morality, or other factors. For instance [[vegetarian]]s choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a healthier diet, avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of [[dietary fiber]] and [[antioxidant]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Ruth Ann |coauthors=Finley, Carrie E. |title=Healthy Eating Every Day |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0736051864&id=ecTPtGlLbvsC |date=January 1, 2005 |publisher=Human Kinetics |id= ISBN 0-7360-5186-4}}</ref>

More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from [[genetically modified food]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Parekh |first=Sarad R. |title=The Gmo Handbook: Genetically Modified Animals, Microbes, and Plants in Biotechnology |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1588293076&id=PG93saRF1qQC&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&sig=oiAY8-a5RSxOk0NQ_H2fwaxmyj8 |date=January 1, 2004 |publisher=Humana Press |id= ISBN 1-58829-307-6|pages=pp. 187-206}}</ref> Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming on [[animal welfare]], human health and the [[Ecology|environment]] are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a [[counterculture]] with a preference for [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Schor |first=Juliet |coauthors=Taylor, Betsy (editors) |title=Sustainable Planet: Roadmaps for the Twenty-First Century |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0807004553&id=GLCO098zncIC |date=January 20, 2003 |publisher=Beacon Press |id= ISBN 0-8070-0455-3}}</ref>

=== Nutrients in food ===

<!-- <ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |title= |url= |date= |publisher= |id= ISBN |pages=pp. }}</ref> -->{{main|Nutrition}}

Between the extremes of optimal health and death from [[starvation]] or [[malnutrition]], there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to diseases such as [[scurvy]], [[obesity]] or [[osteoporosis]], as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories.  Macronutrients means [[fat]], [[protein]], and [[carbohydrate]]s. Micronutrients are the [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[vitamins]].  Additionally food contains [[water]] and [[dietary fiber]].
