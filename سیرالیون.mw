'''Sierra Leone''', officially the '''Republic of Sierra Leone''', is a country in [[West Africa]]. It is bordered by [[ګونې]] on the north and [[Liberia]] on the south, with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the west. The name Sierra Leone was adapted from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name for the country: ''Serra Leoa.''  The literal meaning is "Lion Mountains." During the 1700s Sierra Leone was an important centre of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Transatlantic Slave Trade]]. The capital [[Freetown]] was founded in [[1792]] by the [[Sierra Leone Company]] as a home for [[Black British|Black Britons]] who had fought for the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. 

In 1808, Freetown became a [[British Empire|British]] [[Crown Colony]], and in 1896, the interior of the country became a British [[Protectorate]]. The Crown Colony and Protectorate joined and gained [[independence]] in [[1961]]. From [[1991]] to [[2000]], the country suffered greatly under a devastating [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]]. To end the civil war, [[United Nations|UN]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] forces disarmed 17,000 militia and rebels, in the largest UN [[peacekeeping]] act of the decade. The average life span of a Sierra Leonean is 38 years for men and 42 years for women. [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sl.html#People]

== History ==
{{Main|History of Sierra Leone}}

The written [[history]] of Sierra Leone began in [[1462]], when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer Pedro da Cintra landed and named the country. [[Europe]]ans used the land as a source for [[Slavery|slaves]], but in 1792 [[Freetown]] was established as a haven for former slaves who had been living in [[Nova Scotia]].

In 1808, Sierra Leone became a British [[Crown Colony]], which it remained until halfway through the 20th century, when the process of de-colonization was commenced. This culminated in independence on [[April 27]], [[1961]]. Sir [[Milton Margai]] (1895-1964) was the first prime minister.

Sierra Leone became a one-party state in the early 1970s. The country suffered a [[civil war]] beginning in 1991, with the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), led by [[Foday Sankoh]], attacking government soldiers and civilians indiscriminately ([[Sierra Leone Civil War]]). This resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (well over one-third of the population) many of whom became refugees in neighboring countries. A military [[coup]] on [[May 25]], [[1997]] briefly replaced then President [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] with Major [[Johnny Paul Koromah]]. Kabbah was reinstated in March 1998 after the junta was ousted by the Nigerian-led [[ECOMOG]] forces.  

The [[Lomé Peace Accord]], signed on [[July 7]], [[1999]] in [[Lomé]], [[Togo]] offered hope that the country would be able to terminate the period of civil chaos that had engulfed it, and rebuild its devastated economy and infrastructure. As of late 1999, up to 6,000 [[UNAMSIL]] peacekeepers were in the process of deploying to bolster the peace accord.

In May 2000, the situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]] to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order. They stabilized the situation, and were the catalyst for a ceasefire and ending of the civil war. United Nations peacekeeping forces withdrew at the end of 2005.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Sierra Leone}}

The head of state and government is the president, who is elected every five years (most recently in May 2002). He appoints and heads a cabinet of ministers. The [[Parliament of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leonean parliament]] is [[unicameral]], with 124 seats. 112 members are elected concurrently with the presidential elections; the other 12 seats are filled by paramount chiefs from each of the country's 12 [[Districts of Sierra Leone's|administrative districts]].

Local Government elections were held in [[2004]] (for the first time since [[1972]]), electing 456 councillors sitting in 19 local councils.

== Administrative Divisions ==
''Main articles: [[Provinces of Sierra Leone]], [[Districts of Sierra Leone]]''

Sierra Leone is divided into three [[province]]s and one area, and subdivided into 14 [[district]]s.

The [[Provinces of Sierra Leone|provinces]] include:
*[[Eastern Province, Sierra Leone|Eastern Province]]
*[[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Province]]
*[[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|Southern Province]]
*[[Western Area, Sierra Leone|Western Area]]

Districts: see [[Districts of Sierra Leone]]

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Sierra_Leone-Mappa.gif|thumb|Map of Sierra Leone]]
{{MapLibrary|Sierra_Leone_sat.png|Sierra Leone}}
{{Main|Geography of Sierra Leone}}

Much of Sierra Leone's coastline consists of [[mangrove]] swamps, with the exception of the [[peninsula]] on which the capital city Freetown is located. The rest of Sierra Leone is mostly plateau (about 300&nbsp;[[metre|m]] or 1,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] above sea level) covered by forests, with mountains in the northeast of the country (highest point [[Loma Mansa]], 1,948&nbsp;m; 6,391&nbsp;ft). The climate is tropical, with a rainy season from May to December.

Major cities are the capital [[Freetown, Sierra Leone|Freetown]], [[Koidu-Sefadu, Sierra Leone|Koidu (Sefadu)]], [[Bo, Sierra Leone|Bo]], [[Kenema, Sierra Leone|Kenema]] and [[Makeni, Sierra Leone|Makeni]].

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Sierra Leone}}

"Sierra Leone is an extremely poor nation with tremendous inequality in income distribution. It has the lowest average income in the world. It does have substantial [[mineral]] and fishery resources and agricultural potential. However, the economic and [[social infrastructure]] is not well developed, and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic development, following an 11-year civil war. About two-thirds of the working-age population engages in subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market." [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sl.html]

Economic development has always been hampered by an overdependence on mineral exploitation. Successive governments and the population as a whole have always believed that "diamonds and gold" are sufficient generators of foreign currency earnings and lure for investment. As a result large scale agriculture of commodity products, industrial development and sustainable investments have been neglected by governments. The economy could thus be described as one which is "exploitative" and based on the extraction of unsustainable resources or non reusable assets.  

There are plans to reopen [[bauxite]] and [[rutile]] mines shut down during the conflict. The major source of hard currency consists of the mining of [[diamond]]s. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad.

But beyond these purely economic factors, Sierra Leone also suffers from endemic official corruption. Government officials in successive governments have shown themselves more interested in lining their own pockets than improving the lives of average Sierra Leoneans. This is Sierra Leone's principal barrier to development.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Sierra Leone}}

There are about 14 different ethnic groups living in Sierra Leone, which together make up about 99% of the population. The most important tribes are the [[Temne people|Temne]] (mostly in the north) and [[Mende people|Mende]] (central and south), both forming about one third of the population. There is a sizeable number of [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krios]], descendants of [[slavery|enslaved]] Africans, freed in [[London]] in the late 1700s and later returned to West Africa. Other groups include the Limba, Susu, Madingo, Kono, Yalunka. The tribes are distinct in some of their music, traditions, cultures. At the same time, there are many overlapping traditions.

Although [[English language|English]] is the official language, it is understood by only a [[minority]], as most people speak their tribe's own language. The [[Sierra Leone Krio language|Krio language]], based on English and African languages, is however spoken by most of the population. Islam and Christianity both claim many adherents in Sierra Leone, though Muslims are more numerous than Christians.  Sierra Leoneans also adhere to traditional African religious practices.  

Sierra Leone is the worst nation in the world for [[childbirth]], having the highest [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] (MMR), or risk of [[maternal death]], of any country. The MMR of Sierra Leone, according to a report from the World Health Organization in the year 2000, is 2,000 maternal deaths per live 100,000 births. The extremely high MMR is principally due to a lack of capacity to deal with [[obstetric]] complications such as [[hemorrhage]], obstructed labor, [[ectopic pregnancy|ectoptic gestation]], [[puerperal sepsis]], and complications caused by unsafe [[abortion]].  Those situations were aggravated by the rebellion and the detrimental effects on distribution of reproductive health services due to the massive displacement of people, destruction of medical infrastructure and hospital equipment, rural inaccessibility, poor and disadvantageous accessibility to basic medical service.
