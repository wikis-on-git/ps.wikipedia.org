Prior to his political career, he was an [[entrepreneur]] in the [[oil industry]] and served as the managing general partner/owner of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[baseball]] team. 
Bush, a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was elected 46th [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994 and was re-elected in 1998. From there, he moved on to win the nomination of the Republican Party for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential race]] and ultimately defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] in a particularly close and controversial <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1067820.stm The long road to the White House] - Tom Carver, [[BBC]], [[December 14]], [[2000]] </ref> general election. In 2004, Bush was [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|elected to a second term]], defeating Democratic [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]. This term will expire [[January 20]], [[2009]].

Bush's presidency has been defined by the ongoing [[War on Terror]] including the [[Iraq War]] following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. In the aftermath the U.S. and a [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational force]] (dubbed the "[[Coalition of the Willing]]") took military action in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], overthrowing and capturing Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]. The war proved controversial both in the United States and internationally. In response to the September 11th attacks, Bush and [[United States Congress|congress]] created the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and increased the powers of law enforcement agencies with the passage of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].

Bush has also signed into law large tax cuts and a [[Medicare]] prescription drug plan. He has appointed two justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], including a new [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]. Bush's terms of office coincided with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] control of the United States Congress, giving him greater control over policy formulation than presidents dealing with an opposition-controlled Congress. While continuing American policy of support for [[Israel]], President Bush became the first U.S. president to also endorse the creation of a [[Palestine|Palestinian]] state. His promise of $15 billion (over 5 years) to Africa for AIDS relief was funded by Congress. In late 2005 and 2006, Bush led the world community in opposition to [[Iran]]'s announced intention to develop [[nuclear]] technology.

Bush is a member of a prominent [[Bush family|political family]]: his father, [[George H. W. Bush]], served as U.S. President for four years and as Vice President for eight, his brother [[Jeb Bush]] is the current [[Governor of Florida]], and his grandfather, [[Prescott Bush]], was a Republican [[United States Senator]] from Connecticut. Among his family, he acquired the [[nickname]] "'''W'''" (for his middle initial; later '''Dubya''', a literal spelling of a colloquial pronunciation of the letter), which has become a common public nickname, used both affectionately and pejoratively. He is the second son of a former United States president to become president himself.

{{main articles|[[Early life of George W. Bush]] and [[Professional life of George W. Bush]]}}

The eldest son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and his wife [[Barbara Bush]] (''[[Maiden name|née]]'' Pierce), George Walker Bush was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. He moved to [[Texas]] with his family at the age of two and he identifies himself as a native Texan. He was raised in [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] with his siblings [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]], [[Neil Bush|Neil]], [[Marvin Bush|Marvin]], and [[Dorothy Bush Koch|Dorothy]]. Another younger sister, [[Robin Bush|Robin]], died in 1953 at age three from [[leukemia]]. <ref>[http://www.famoustexans.com/georgewbush.htm George Walker Bush] - ''Famous Texans'' </ref>

Following family tradition, he attended prep school in New England, at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[Massachusetts]], the same school his father attended. Bush then enrolled at [[Yale University]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[History]] in 1968. As a senior, Bush was a member of the secretive [[Skull and Bones]] society, as was his father. In May 1968, at the height of the [[Vietnam War]], he entered the [[Air National Guard|Texas Air National Guard]]. He trained in the guard for two years, where he was among the last to learn to fly the F-102, a plane not used in Vietnam and due to be retired. Bush was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] in November 1970 on the recommendation of his commander [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt. Col.]] [[Jerry B. Killian]]. He served as an [[F-102]] pilot until 1972.

In 1974, he obtained permission to end his six-year service obligation six months early in order to attend [[Harvard Business School]], from which he earned his [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) in 1975; he is the first U.S. President to hold an MBA. After graduation, Bush returned to Texas to enter the oil business. Two years later, he married [[Laura Bush|Laura Welch]], a school [[librarian]] originally from Midland, Texas. Their twin daughters [[Barbara and Jenna Bush]] were born in 1981. Bush is the only U.S. President to be the father of twins.

Early in his professional life, Bush ran, or was a partner in a number of oil companies, including [[Arbusto Energy]], [[Spectrum 7]], and the [[Harken Energy]] Corporation. Bush started his political career assisting his father's 1964 and 1970 campaigns for the U.S Senate, neither of which was successful. He then served as political director for an [[Alabama]] senate campaign. In 1978, Bush ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. After working on his father's successful [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential campaign]], Bush purchased a share in the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] franchise, in April 1989, where he became managing general partner.

In [[1993]], Bush and his brother [[Jeb Bush]] both decided to run for governor, George in [[Texas]] and Jeb in [[Florida]]. Although his brother was unsuccessful, George Bush ended up defeating popular incumbent [[Ann Richards]] on [[1994-11-08]], to become [[Governor of Texas]]. That same year, he and his partners sold the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] with the governor realizing a profit of nearly $15 million. <ref>[http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/3/bryce-bush.asp George W. and the Texas Press: Is the Honeymoon Over?] - Robert Bryce, [[Columbia Journalism Review]], May/June 2004</ref> In 1998 Bush went on to win re-election in a [[landslide victory]] with nearly 69% of the vote, becoming the first Texas governor to be elected for two consecutive four-year terms (before 1975, the gubernatorial term of office was two years). <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/03/election/governors/texas Texas Gov. George W. Bush wins in landslide] - [[CNN]], [[November 3]], [[1998]]</ref> During Bush's governorship, he undertook significant legislative changes in [[criminal justice]], [[tort]] law, and school financing.

==مذهبي عقيدې او عملونه==
A 1985 meeting with [[evangelist]] [[Billy Graham]] ultimately led Bush to give up [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and devote himself to a more serious practice of [[Christianity]]. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24634-2004Sep15.html Openly Religious, to a Point] - Alan Cooperman, ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[September 16]], [[2004]] </ref> During this period, he left the Bush family's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] faith to join his wife's [[United Methodist Church]], a denomination that in part represents a more socially conservative [[worldview]] (see [[United Methodist Church#Diversity Within Methodist Beliefs|United Methodist Church "Diversity Within Methodist Beliefs"]]). 

Bush attends services at St. John's Episcopal Church <ref>[http://www.stjohns-dc.org St. John's Church] (Episcopal)</ref> on a semi-regular basis. This is apparently a matter of convenience for chief executives, as the church is situated immediately across from the White House, off Lafayette square. Every president since Madison has attended services there. <ref>[http://www.stjohns-dc.org/st_john/history.html St. John's History]</ref>

In the televised Republican presidential debate held in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]] on [[December 13]] [[1999]], all of the participating candidates were asked: ''"What political [[philosophy|philosopher]] or thinker do you most identify with and why?"'' Unlike the other candidates, who cited former presidents and other political figures, Bush responded "[[Christ]], because he changed my heart." His decision to name a religious figure generated some criticism - even among religious conservatives such as [[Alan Keyes]] <ref>[http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/media/interviews/99_12_15crossfire.htm Transcript] of [[Alan Keyes]] on [[Crossfire]] with hosts [[Robert Novak]] and [[Bill Press]], [[December 15]], [[1999]]</ref> and [[Bill Kristol]]. 

During his Presidency, Bush has also hosted celebrations at the [[White House]] for non-Christian holidays such as [[Ramadan]] <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/ramadan/2003/index.bak.html Ramadan at the White House]</ref>.  He also took a stand to retain the White House's main "Christmas Tree."

Bush's overt Christian faith is believed to have aided his election, as [[Evangelical Christian]]s overwhelmingly voted for him in both the 2000 and 2004 election.

==Presidential campaigns==
===2000 campaign===
{{main article|[[U.S. presidential election, 2000]]}}
Advisors convinced George W. Bush that 2000 would be the right time to run for president.  He had more than enough money, and the Republicans lacked any single strong candidate. Before Bush had even committed to the race, he was the clear favorite in the polls, and contributions abounded from political donors. Bush declared himself a "[[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]]", a term coined by [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] professor [[Marvin Olasky]], and his [[political campaign]] promised to "restore honor and dignity to the White House." Bush proposed lowering taxes in response to a projected surplus, supported participation of [[religion|religious]] [[charity|charities]] in federally funded programs, and promoted [[education vouchers]], [[oil drilling]] in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], a balanced [[United States budget process|budget]], and structural changes to the [[United States armed forces]].Bush's [[foreign policy]] campaign platform supported a stronger economic and political relationship with [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]], and reduced involvement in "[[nation-building]]" and other minor military engagements indirectly related to U.S. interests.

[[Image:GoreBush.jpg|thumb|left|Al Gore greets President-elect Bush at the White House in late December of 2000.]]

Bush lost the [[New Hampshire primary]] to [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]], but rebounded to capture 9 of 13 [[Super Tuesday]] states, effectively clinching the nomination. Bush then chose [[Dick Cheney]], a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] for Bush's father, as his [[running mate]] in [[July]] of 2000.

On [[November 7]] [[2000]] (Election Day), television networks initially called the state of [[Florida]] for his opponent, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]], then withdrew that projection and later called the state for Bush along with the entire election, and finally declared that it was too close to call. Sometime after the networks reported that Bush had won Florida, Gore conceded the election and then rescinded that concession less than one hour later. Though Bush had 47.9% of the [[popular vote]] and Gore had 48.4%, the [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral votes]] were less clear. The [[Florida]] vote count, which favored Bush in preliminary tallies, was contested over allegations of irregularities in the voting and tabulation processes. Allegations included confusing ballots, defective voting machines, faulty [[absentee ballot]]s from the military, and the illegal barring of some voters. Because of Florida state law, a state-wide machine recount was triggered and completed. Although it narrowed the gap, the recount still left Bush in the lead. Eventually four counties in Florida which had large numbers of Presidential undervotes began a manual hand recount of ballots. A legal battle ensued between the Bush and Gore campaigns over these recounts. On [[December 8]], the Florida Supreme Court ruled that every county with a large number of undervotes would perform a hand recount. On [[December 9]], in the ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' Supreme Court case, the Court stopped the statewide hand recount and upheld the machine recount due to time constraints. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote, giving him 271 [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral votes]] to Gore's 266; Bush carried 30 of the 50 states. Several months later, a group of newspapers commissioned a study of what would have happened had the hand recount continued. The researchers conducting the study concluded that, under the standard for assessing ballots in use during the actual count, Bush still would have won. However, other reasonable counting methods would have given the victory to Bush in four cases and Gore in four others <ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/89693365.html?did=89693365&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+13%2C+2001&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Ballot-Count+Scenarios+in+Bush-Gore+2000 Ballot-Count Scenarios in Bush-Gore 2000] - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[November 13]], [[2001]] </ref> <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/florida.ballots/stories/main.html Florida recount study: Bush still wins] - [[CNN]], [[2001]]</ref>. Since the Supreme Court did not allow the recount to continue, no one knows what standard might have been prescribed by it, or by a lower court at its direction, had the recount been reinstated. In the final official count, Bush had won Florida by only 537 votes (2,912,790 for Bush to 2,912,253 for Gore) <ref> [http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm 2000 OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL ELECTION RESULTS] - [[Federal Election Commission]], report on [[November 7]], [[2001]] elections </ref> earning the needed 25 electoral votes and the presidency. Bush was inaugurated [[January 20]] [[2001]].

Not since the [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888 election]] had a winner failed to receive a plurality of the [[popular vote]]. It was the first since the [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|1876 election]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affected the decision.

====Substance abuse controversy====
{{main article|[[George W. Bush substance abuse controversy]]}}
On [[September 4]], [[1976]], near his family's summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]], [[Maine]], police arrested Bush for [[Drunk driving (United States)|driving under the influence]] of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], having been drinking with former [[Australian]] world number one [[tennis]] player [[John Newcombe]]. He pleaded guilty, was fined $150, and had his [[driver's license]] suspended for 30 days within [[Maine]]. <ref name="CNNDUI">[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/02/bush.dui Bush acknowledges 1976 DUI charge], [[CNN]], [[November 2]], [[2000]]</ref> <ref>''[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/bushdui1.html The Smoking Gun]'' report</ref>
News of the arrest was published five days before the 2000 presidential election. Bush has described his days before his religious conversion in his 40s as his "nomadic" period of "irresponsible youth" and admitted to drinking "too much" in those years. He says he changed to a sober lifestyle shortly after waking up with a [[hangover]] after his 40th birthday celebration. He attributed the change partly to a 1985 meeting with the [[The Reverend|Reverend]] [[Billy Graham]], though by his own admission, he did still drink as recently as July 1986.<ref name="CNNDUI"/>

Bush has stated he did not use illegal drugs at any time since 1979. An aide clarified this as being 1974, and the correction was first broadcasted on [[CNN]].

===2004 campaign===
[[Image:Bush 43 10-19-04 Stpete.jpg|thumb|George W. Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004.]]
{{main article|[[2004 Presidential Election]]}}

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], Bush was able to win re-election against [[John Kerry]], the [[USDP|Democratic]] candidate and senator from [[Massachusetts]]. Despite the fact that Kerry was a decorated naval officer in the [[Vietnam War]], polls showed that Bush had convinced the people he and his administration would be better able to protect the nation from another terrorist attack. Bush carried 31 of 50 states for 286 [[Electoral College]] votes. The highest voter turnout since 1968 gave him more popular votes than any previous presidential candidate (62,040,610 votes/50.7%). This was the first time since 1988 that a President received a popular majority. However, Bush's victory margin, in terms of absolute number of popular votes, was the smallest of any sitting president since Harry S. Truman in 1948. Also, Bush's win was, percentage-wise, the closest popular margin ever for a sitting president. Senator [[John Kerry]] carried 19 states and the [[District of Columbia]], earning him 251 Electoral College votes (59,028,111 votes/48.3%). A [[U.S. Electoral College#Faithless electors|faithless elector]], pledged to Kerry, voted for Democratic Vice Presidential running mate, [[John Edwards]], giving him one [[Electoral College]] vote. No other candidate won College votes. Notable third-party candidates included Independent [[Ralph Nader]] (463,653 votes / 0.4%), and Libertarian [[Michael Badnarik]] (397,265 votes/0.3%). Congress debated potential election irregularities, including allegations of [[2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities|voting irregularities]] in [[Ohio]] and electronic voting machine fraud. An Official challenge to the Ohio election was rejected by a vote of 1-74 by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and 31-267 in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]].

Bush was [[inauguration|inaugurated]] for his second term on [[January 20]] [[2005]]. The [[oath of office]] was administered by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]]. Bush's inaugural address centered mainly on a theme of spreading [[freedom]] and [[democracy]] around the world.

====National Guard Military service====
{{main article|[[George W. Bush military service controversy]]}}
[[Image:GW-Bush-in-uniform.jpg|thumb|left|George W. Bush in his National Guard uniform.]]

Bush's military service record has been a point of controversy, especially during the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. During the 2004 presidential campaign, various partisan groups such as [[Texans for Truth]] called adverse attention to Bush's military service history. Additionally, specific and harsh criticisms on this topic were made by such notable Democrats as then [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Terry McAuliffe|Terence R. McAuliffe]]. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A7372-2004Feb2?language=printer Bush's Guard Service In Question] - Lois Romano, ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[February 3]], [[2004]] </ref> President Bush was [[Military discharge|honorably discharged]].

==Important people in Bush's life and career==
Bush's family and advisers are considered important to him in his life and career. His father, [[George H. W. Bush]], served as U.S. President, his younger brother, [[Jeb Bush]] is the current [[Governor of Florida]], and his grandfather, [[Prescott Bush]], was a [[United States Senator]]. His wife [[Laura Bush|Laura]] and his mother [[Barbara Bush]] are also considered important to his life. His most trusted advisers have included many women, including [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Karen Hughes]], and [[Harriet Miers]]. [[Karl Rove]] has had perhaps the greatest influence on Bush's professional life.

==Presidency 2001- ==

Bush, and [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] after reading a statement to the press during the closing moments of the Red Sea Summit in [[Aqaba]], [[Jordan]], on [[June 4]] [[2003]]]]

===First term===
His most controversial appointment was [[John Ashcroft]] as Attorney General. Democrats vigorously opposed Ashcroft, citing [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] positions on issues, such as [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]], though he was eventually confirmed.  On his first day in office, Bush moved to block federal aid to foreign groups that offered counselling or any other assistance to women in obtaining abortions. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html Restoration of the Mexico City Policy] - [[White House]] memorandum, from Bush to "administrator of the United States Agency for International Development", [[January 22]], [[2001]]</ref> Days later, he announced his commitment to channelling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations that critics feared would dissolve the traditional [[separation of church and state]]. <ref>[http://www.americamagazine.org/gettext.cfm?articleTypeID=1&textID=2601&issueID=411 Church, State and the Faith-Based Initiative] - Thomas E. Buckly, ''[[America (magazine)|America]]'',  [[November 11]], [[2002]] </ref> <ref>[http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/churchandstate2.html Faith-based Initiatives] - [[NOW (series)|NOW]], [[PBS]], [[September 26]], [[2003]] </ref>

Republicans lost control of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in June, when [[Vermont]]'s [[James Jeffords]] quit the Republican party to become an [[independent (politician)|independent]], but not before five Senate Democrats crossed party lines to approve Bush's $1.35 billion tax cut. Less than three months later, however, the administration released budget projections that showed the projected [[budget surplus]] decreasing to nothing over the next years.

===Second term===
President Bush's second term has been characterized by misfortune both political and natural. Following his fifth [[State of the Union]], the President pushed for [[Social Security]] reform, a measure which was initially supported by the President's party but was unable to pass the congress after bipartisan opposition arose. Ramifications of special prosecutor [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]'s investigation into the [[Valerie Plame]] leak case caused loss of public faith in the [[Office of the President]] [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/PollVault/story?id=949950], and preempted the resignation of high level White House staff. The federal response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and question of cronyism in August 2005 proved to be difficult for the president. [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s resignation and the death of Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] allowed for the nomination and appointment of two new justices. President Bush initially nominated [[John Roberts]] to replace Justice O'Connor, but on the death of Justice Rehnquist asked the Senate to confirm Roberts as Chief Justice. [[Harriet Miers]] was the president's second choice to fill the vacancy of Justice O'Connor, but after the withdrawal of Miers nomination decided upon [[Samuel Alito]], who was successfully appointed to the [[Supreme Court]]. Currently a debate on the legality of President Bush's domestic surveillance program has led to public debate on the limits of [[executive privilege]] and some fractions within his own party.

===Political ideology===
During the 2000 election campaign Bush started to use the phrase [[compassionate conservatism]] to describe his beliefs. Some conservatives have questioned Bush's commitment to traditional conservative ideals because of his willingness to incur large [[budget deficit]]s by permitting substantial spending increases. Democrats and liberals have claimed that the prefixing of the word "conservative" with the adjective "compassionate" was less a new ideology and more a way of making conservatism seem palatable to independent and swing voters. In his 2005 [[inaugural address]] he outlined his vision of [[foreign policy]] and plan for democracy promotion. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.pdf The National Security Strategy of the United States of America] - released by the [[White House]], September 2002</ref>

An important element of Bush's presidency is its emphasis on the importance of executive powers and privileges. According to Bush and his supporters, the War on Terrorism requires a very strong executive with the ability to take various kinds of otherwise illegal covert actions against terrorists. For example, Bush repeatedly argued that the limits imposed by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] over-restrict its ability to monitor terrorists electronically, and has pushed for statutory exemptions to those restrictions, including certain parts of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. The Bush administration threatened to veto two defense bills that included amendments by Senator [[John McCain]] that would limit the ability of the executive to authorize [[torture|cruel inhuman and degrading treatment]]; Bush and his supporters argued that harsh treatment of detainees believed to be terrorists can be necessary to obtain information that would prevent terrorist attacks. <ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/400rhqav.asp The Truth about Torture] - Charles Krauthammer, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', [[December 5]], [[2005]]</ref> Administration lawyers like [[John Yoo]] have argued that the president has inherent authority to wage war as he sees fit, regardless of laws and treaties that may restrict that power. <ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/warpowers925.htm THE PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST TERRORISTS AND NATIONS SUPPORTING THEM] - [[United States]] [[Department of Justice]]</ref> Bush's [[Chief Justice of the United States]] appointee, [[John Roberts]], considers the executive's power to be quite broad as well; in his decision in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', he wrote that Common Article III of the [[Geneva Conventions]] did not apply to people detained in the War on Terrorism, thus authorizing secret military tribunals for suspected terrorists if Bush chose to use them. The administration has classified previously public information about the executive and written [[executive order]]s to block [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests and to keep old documents classified beyond their normal expiration date. <ref>[http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=express&s=prados042104 Declassifixation] - John Prados, ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[April 21]], [[2004]]</ref> Bush's critics argue that executive power that is not reviewable risks abuse for political purposes, undermines civil liberties <ref>[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060109/editors  Bush's High Crimes] - editorial, ''[[The Nation]]'', [[December 20]], [[2005]] </ref> and that they are anti-democratic, immoral, and likely to cause resentment, as in the world's response to [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib]]. <ref>[http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20051219&s=sullivan121905 The Abolition of Torture] - Andrew Sullivan, ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[December 7]], [[2005]]</ref> Bush's supporters respond that broad powers in the War on Terrorism are necessary to prevent major attacks against the United States <ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110001797 Uncuff the FBI] - Mark Riebling, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' OpinionJournal, [[June 4]], [[2002]]</ref> and that the president has not abused these powers. <ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/bminiter/?id=95001607 The Fog of War Reporting] - Brendan Miniter, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' OpinionJournal, [[December 17]], [[2001]]</ref>

===Administration===
{{main article|[[George W. Bush administration]]}}
Bush places a high value on personal [[loyalty]] and, as a result, his administration has high [[Message Discipline|message discipline]]. Critics allege that Bush is willing to overlook mistakes and that Bush has surrounded himself with "[[yes men]]".

Bush's presidency has been characterized by a vigorous defense of executive privilege.  Many commentators have claimed that deference to executive privilege was one of the principal considerations Bush's administration considered when he proposed his three nominations for the Supreme Court, and appointed [[John R. Bolton]] to the [[United Nations]].

Bush also has performed many of his presidential duties from his ranch in [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford]], Texas, dubbed "The Western White House". As of [[August 2]] [[2000]], Bush had visited the ranch 49 times during his time as President, accruing 319 days away from the White House and nearly reaching Reagan's eight-year record of 335 days in 5.5 years. The administration has supported this trend, saying it helps the president get a different perspective from [[Inside the Beltway|Beltway thinking]] and that he is still working (the administration noted that Bush's longest visit to Crawford, in August 2005, included only one week of actual respite in the five-week visit.)

A list of Bush's cabinet appointees is included on the [[George W. Bush administration|main administration page]].

===Foreign policy===
{{main article|[[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration]]}}
His foreign policy includes such events as the plans to create a missile defence system and rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.
Days after taking office, Bush stated "I am going to go forward with... [[anti-ballistic missile#The George W. Bush administration and ABM|plans for a missile defense]] system." <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010126-7.html Remarks by the President in Photo Opportunity with Governors] - [[White House]] press release, [[January 26]], [[2001]]</ref> To accomplish this deployment, Bush announced on [[May 1]] [[2001]] his desire to withdraw from the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] and deploy a missile defense system with the ability to shield against a limited attack by a [[rogue state]]. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html Transcript] - speech by Bush at [[National Defense University]], [[Washington]], [[May 1]], [[2001]]</ref> The [[American Physical Society]] criticized this policy change, citing doubts about the system's effectiveness. <ref>[http://www.aps.org/public_affairs/popa/reports/nmd03.cfm Report of the APS Study Group on Boost-Phase Intercept Systems for National Missile Defense] - [[American Physical Society]], Panel on Public Affairs, [[July 15]], [[2003]] </ref> Bush argued this was justified as the treaty's [[Cold War]] benefits were no longer relevant. The official notification of withdrawal from the treaty was announced on [[December 13]] [[2001]], citing the need to protect against terrorism. While there is past precedent for a President to cancel a treaty, most past cases have involved Congressional authorization. <ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article02/11.html#2 Termination of Treaties by Notice] - FindLaw, accessed [[February 20]], [[2006]] </ref>
Terrorism was Bush's main topic at the [[NATO|2002 NATO Summit]] in [[Prague]] too, calling for restructuring the organization from a Cold War focus and prepare it for new threats.
During his first presidential visit to [[Europe]] in June 2001, European leaders criticized of kyotoBush for his rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to reduce [[global warming]]. In 2002, Bush rejected the [[treaty]] as harmful to [[economic growth]] in the United States, stating: "My approach recognizes that economic growth is the solution, not the problem." <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020214-5.html President Announces Clear Skies & Global Climate Change Initiatives] - [[White House]] press release, [[February 14]], [[2002]]</ref>
The administration also disputed the scientific basis of the treaty. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010611-2.html President Bush Discusses Global Climate Change] - [[White House]] press release, [[June 11]], [[2001]]</ref> In November 2004, [[Russia]] ratified the treaty, meeting the quota of nations required to enforce it without ratification by the United States.

International leaders also criticized Bush for withdrawing support for the [[International Criminal Court]] soon after he assumed the presidency.
Bush made the following comment: "I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court. It's a body based in Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecution can pull our troops or diplomats for trial."
Probably his most significant foreign policy action was, however, launch of [[The War on Terror]].  

====Terrorism====
[[Image:Bush Ground Zero.jpg|thumb|right|President Bush addresses rescue workers at [[Ground Zero]] in [[New York]], September 14, 2001: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."]]

On September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were carried out by a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization known as [[al-Qaeda]], which is led by [[Osama bin Laden]], who had issued a [[fatwah]] against the [[United States]] in 1997.In response to these  attacks, on [[October 7]] [[2001]], the United States, with international support, launched a war against the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Taliban]] regime, charged with harboring bin Laden. The regime was quickly defeated. Subsequent nation-building efforts with the [[United Nations]] and Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] have had mixed results. [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|Democratic elections]] were held on [[October 9]] [[2004]]. Even though international observers called the elections "fairly democratic" at the "overall majority" of polling centers, 15 of the 18 presidential candidates nevertheless threatened to withdraw, alleging flawed registration and validation. <ref> [http://fpc.state.gov/fpc/37133.htm The First Democratic Elections in Afghanistan: A Report by the Bipartisan Observer Team] - [[United States Department of State]], [[October 15]], [[2004]] </ref>

{{further|[[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]}}

Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration also promoted urgent action in Iraq, stating that Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] once again had [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), even though Saddam claimed to have destroyed all the chemical and biological weapons he had before 1991 (he had used WMD in the [[Halabja poison gas attack]] against the [[Kurds]] in northern Iraq in 1988, when his chemical and biological weapons program was being covertly funded and supported, in part, by the United States and Britain). The theory that Saddam had destroyed his WMD capability was asserted by former weapons inspector Scott Ritter <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,351165,00.html Exclusive: Scott Ritter in His Own Words] - [[Scott Ritter]], interview by Massimo Calabresi, [[Time Magazine]], [[September 14]], [[2002]] </ref> and the UN's former chief weapons inspector [[Hans Blix]]. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3323633.stm Blix sceptical on Iraqi WMD claim] - [[BBC]], [[December 16]], [[2003]] </ref> Bush also said that Saddam was a threat to U.S. security, destabilized the [[Middle East]], inflamed the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], and financed [[terrorists]]. [[CIA]] reports asserted that Saddam Hussein had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]], had not properly accounted for Iraqi [[biological weapons]] and [[chemical weapons]] material in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]], and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. It had been, since 1998, U.S. policy for the President to support efforts to remove Saddam Hussein from power by a law (the [[Iraq Liberation Act]]) passed by the [[House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate]] and later signed by [[President Bill Clinton]]. <ref> [http://www.cia.gov/cia/reports/iraq_wmd/Iraq_Oct_2002.htm Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs] - [[CIA]], October 2002</ref> <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html The secret Downing Street memo] -  [[Times Online]], [[May 1]], [[2005]] </ref>

Asserting that Saddam Hussein could provide terrorists with WMD, Bush urged the [[United Nations]] to enforce Iraqi [[disarmament]] mandates, precipitating a [[Iraq disarmament crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. On [[November 13]] [[2002]], under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]], Hans Blix and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. Lapses in Iraqi cooperation triggered intense debate over the efficacy of inspections. UN inspection teams departed Iraq upon U.S. advisement given four days prior to full-scale hostilities. <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm U.S advises weapons inspectors to leave Iraq] - [[USA Today]], [[March 17]], [[2003]] </ref>

[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] urged his colleagues in the Bush administration to avoid a war without clear UN approval. The Bush administration initially sought a [[UN Security Council]] resolution authorizing the military force pursuant to [http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/chapterVII.htm Chapter VII] of the [[United Nations Charter]] but, facing vigorous opposition from several nations, (primarily France and Germany), dropped the bid for UN approval and, with over 20 other nations (including the United Kingdom) designated the "[[coalition of the willing]]", prepared for war. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2862343.stm US names 'coalition of the willing'] - Steve Schifferes, [[BBC]], [[March 18]], [[2003]]</ref>

{{further|[[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war]]}}

Military hostilities commenced on [[March 20]] [[2003]] to pre-empt Iraqi WMD deployment and remove Saddam from power. ''[[Casus belli]]'' included Saddam's hindering weapons inspections, an alleged 1991 assassination attempt on Bush's father [[George H. W. Bush]], breach of a 1991 [[ceasefire]], and violation of numerous Security Council resolutions. [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]] and other world leaders questioned the war's legality. Bush declared, "Major combat operations in Iraq have ended" <ref>{{press release reference|URL=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/05/20030501-15.html|Organization=[[White House]]|Date=[[May 1]], [[2003]]|Title=President Bush Announces Major Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended}}</ref>, under a "Mission Accomplished" banner <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/ White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign] - Dana Bash, [[CNN]], [[October 29]], [[2003]] </ref> on [[May 1]] [[2003]]. U.S. deployment and casualties (both military and civilian) have continued through early 2006 despite the capture of Saddam, because of ongoing Iraqi [[insurgency|insurgencies]].

On [[September 30]] [[2004]], the U.S. [[Iraq Survey Group]] Final Report concluded, "ISG has not found evidence that Saddam Husayn (sic) possessed WMD stocks in 2003, but the available evidence from its investigation — including detainee interviews and document exploitation — leaves open the possibility that some weapons existed in Iraq although not of a militarily significant capability." <ref> [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2004/isg-final-report/isg-final-report_vol1_rsi-06.htm Iraq Survey Group Final Report] - [[2004]] </ref> The [[9/11 Commission]] report found no credible evidence that Saddam Hussein possessed WMD, although the report did conclude that Saddam's government was actively attempting to acquire technology that would allow Iraq to produce WMD as soon as U.N. sanctions were lifted. <ref>[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf The 9/11 Commission Report] - [[9/11 Commission]]</ref> In addition, the 9/11 commission found that despite contacts between Iraq and al-Qaeda in 1996, "no collaborative relationship" emerged in regards to the attacks on 9/11. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47812-2004Jun16.html Al Qaeda-Hussein Link Is Dismissed] - Walter Pincus and Dana Milbank, ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[June 17]], [[2004]]</ref>  On
[[December 14]], [[2005]], while discussing the WMD issue, Bush stated that "It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong." <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1930698,00.html Bush: we went to war on faulty intelligence] - ''[[Times Online]]'', [[December 14]], [[2005]]</ref>

However, after the invasion, al-Qaeda has used the war to great effect in its campaign. It is speculated that it is the organization which launched a coordinated string of [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|attacks]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. Three days later, a new Spanish government was elected which soon thereafter withdrew all Spanish forces from Iraq. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/03/15/spain.election/ Spain threatens Iraq pull-out] - [[CNN]], [[March 15]], [[2004]]</ref> [[Osama Bin Laden]] also openly announced that al-Qaeda will attack any country which supports the war in Iraq. <ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003-10-20/attack/main578932.shtml CBS News], [[October 10]], [[2004]]</ref>

====Immigration====
Bush proposed an [[immigration]] bill that would have greatly expanded the use of [[foreign worker|guest worker]] [[visa (document)|visas]]. His proposal would match [[employment|employers]] with [[foreign worker]]s for a period up to six years; however, workers would not be eligible for permanent residency ("green cards") or citizenship. The bill is opposed by some Democratic Senators, including [[Barbara Boxer]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]].

Bush has also publicly stated he would like to tighten security at the [[U.S.]]-[[Mexico]] border, which includes speeding up the [[deportation|deportation process]], building more [[jail|jail cells]] to hold [[illegal immigrants]], and installing more equipment and immigration officers at the border. He does agree with "increasing the number of annual green cards that can lead to citizenship" but does not support giving amnesty to those who are already in the country illegally, ceding that it would only serve as incentive for increased illegal immigration. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/29/bush.immigration/ Bush takes tough talk on immigration to Texas] - [[CNN]], [[November 29]], [[2005]]</ref>

====HIV/AIDS====
In the [[State of the Union]] message in January, 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency [[AIDS]] relief, the [[President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief]]. Bush requested $15 billion for this effort, and Congress supported the president's proposal. The emergency relief effort is led by U.S. Ambassador [[Randall L. Tobias]], the Global AIDS Coordinator at the [[Department of State]]. $9 billion is allocated for new programs in AIDS relief for 15 countries most affected by HIV/AIDS. Another $5 billion will go to continuing support of AIDS relief in 100 countries where the U.S. already has bilateral programs established. An additional $1 billion will go to support the [[Global Fund|Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]. This budget represents more money contributed to fight AIDS globally than all other donor countries combined.

====Trade====
Bush's imposition of a [[United States steel tariff 2002|tariff on imported steel]] and [[U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute|on Canadian softwood lumber]] was controversial in light of his advocacy of [[free market]] [[policies]] in other areas, and attracted criticism both from his fellow [[conservatives]] and from nations affected. The steel tariff was later rescinded under pressure from the [[World Trade Organization]], although the lumber dispute is ongoing.

====Development assistance====
The U.S. State Department and [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) published a strategic plan for the 2004-2009 period. The principal aims are established in President Bush's ''National Security Strategy'': [[diplomacy]], development and defense. President Bush's new policy would increase assistance by 50% for countries that take responsibility for their own development "by ruling justly, investing wisely in their people, and encouraging economic freedom." Development assistance must also be aligned with [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] which means the USAID would support those "countries that are committed to democratic governance, open economies, and wise investment in their people’s education, health, and potential." <ref>[http://www.state.gov/s/d/rm/rls/dosstrat/2004/23503.htm Mission Statement] of [[United States Department of State]], accessed [[February 20]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Domestic policy===
{{main article|[[Domestic policy of George W. Bush]]}}

====Economy and taxes====
During his first term, Bush sought and obtained Congressional approval for three major tax cuts in [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|2001]], [[Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002|2002]], and [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|2003]].  These cuts provided relief to almost every taxpayer, including reducing the lowest tax bracket, an increase in the child tax credit, and elimination of the "marriage penalty". However, cuts were distributed disproportionally to higher income taxpayers (through a decrease in the maximum tax rates), complexity was increased with new categories of income taxed at different rates and new deductions and credits, and the number of individuals subject to the [[alternative minimum tax]] increased since the AMT did not keep pace with the changes.

Federal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first 4 and a half years. The tax cuts, a recession, and increases in outlays all contributed to record budget deficits during the Bush administration. As a percentage of [[GDP]], however, the deficits are lower than those experienced during the [[Reagan Administration]].

[[Inflation]] under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2-3% per year.

Private employment (seasonally adjusted) originally decreased under Bush from 111,680,000 in December 2000 to 108,250,000 in mid-2003. The economy then added private jobs for 25 consecutive months from (July 2003 to August 2005), and the private employment seasonally adjusted numbers increased as of June 2005 when it reached 111,828,000. Considering population growth, that still represents a 4.6% decrease in employment since Bush took office.

In January 2006, the government reported that first-time jobless claims fell to their lowest level in more than five years to 291,000, a sign that the national labor market continues to shake off the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.

Under Bush, the seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate based on the Household Survey started at 4.7% in January 2001, peaked at 6.2% in June 2003, and retreated to 4.9% in August 2005.

Most recently, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the economy under Bush grew at a 1.1% pace, the worst showing in more than three years. <ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060127/bs_nm/economy_gdp_dc Growth pace weakest in three years] - Glenn Somerville, [[Reuters]], [[January 27]], [[2006]]</ref>  Just prior to that in the third quarter, pace of growth was 4.3%, the best showing in more than a year.

====Health, medicine, and Social Security====
{{Unreferenced}}
Bush signed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], which added prescription drug coverage to Medicare (United States), subsidized pharmaceutical corporations, and prohibited the Federal government from negotiating discounts with drug companies. Bush said the law, estimated to cost 400,000,000,000 (USD) over the first 10 years, would give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care" <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/12/20031208-2.html President Signs Medicare Legislation] - [[White House]] transcript/press release, [[December 8]], [[2003]]</ref>. Bush signed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, having declared his aim to "promote a culture of life" <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/06/national/06BUSH.html?ex=1383541200&en=8a6bb5a146fc7935&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND Bush Signs Ban on a Procedure for Abortions] - Richard W. Stevenson, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[November 6]], [[2003]]</ref>. The law has not yet been enforced, having been ruled unconstitutional by three District Courts. It is pending [[Supreme Court]] review.

Bush called for major changes in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], identifying the system's projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax (FICA) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is that it permits workers to own the money they save against the cost of retirement such that cannot be taken away from them by fiat or political whim. The rationale for such accounts is that individuals would theoretically seek better value for their "own" money than if costs were covered by employer-funded insurance or by federal programs. Additionally, consumer choice would use the market to drive efficiencies in the behaviors of providers.

Bush opposes any new embryonic [[stem cell research]], and has limited federal funding for research to studies that use embryonic stem cell lines that were in existence on [[August 9]], [[2001]] (the day of the announcement). There was a controversy as to implication of the restriction. Initially Bush and his supporters claimed around 70 lines existed on that day. The number of viable lines has since been determined to be around 20. In January of 2005 it was determined that all embryonic stem cell lines approved for use in research were contaminated by mouse virus particles derived from the substrates on which the cells were cultured and were consequently probably unusable in therapies for human patients. Adult stem cell funding has not been restricted, and is supported by President Bush as a more viable means of research.

====Education====
In January of 2002, Bush signed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], with Democratic Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] as chief sponsor, which aims to close the achievement gap, measures [[student]] performance, provides options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and targets more federal funding to low-income [[schools]]. Critics say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps.

====Energy and the environment====
Bush's environmental record has been attacked by most [[environmentalist]]s, who charge that his policies cater to industry demands to weaken environmental protections.

Bush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002, authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up [[pollution]] and contaminated sediment in the [[Great Lakes]], as well as the Brownfields Legislation in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial or [[brownfield]] sites.

In December 2003, Bush signed legislation implementing key provisions of his [[Healthy Forests Initiative]]; environmental groups have charged that the plan is simply a giveaway to [[timber]] companies. Another subject of controversy is Bush's [[Clear Skies Initiative]], which seeks to reduce [[air pollution]] through expansion of [[emissions trading]].

Partially due to gas price hikes, Bush proposed tapping the [[oil]] reserves in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].

Bush has opposed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to reduce the effect of [[global warming]], saying it would harm the U.S. economy; the protocol has more than 100 signatory nations. The United States has signed the [[Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]], a pact that allows signatory countries to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually, but with no enforcement mechanism. In January 2006, six former EPA directors, five of them Republican, warned of the consequence of continued inaction on global warming.

====Science====
On [[December 19]] [[2002]], Bush signed into law H. R. 4664, far-reaching legislation to put the [[National Science Foundation]] on a track to double its budget over five years and to create new [[mathematics]] and [[science]] [[education]] initiatives at both the pre-college and [[undergraduate]] level.

On [[January 14]] [[2004]], Bush announced a major re-direction for the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Known as the [[Vision for Space Exploration]], it calls for the completion of the [[International Space Station]] by 2010 and the retirement of the [[space shuttle]] while developing a new [[spacecraft]] called the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] under the title [[Project Constellation]]. The CEV would be used to return American [[astronauts]] to the [[Moon]] by 2018.

The White House has come under criticism for downplaying reports that link human activity and greenhouse gas emissions to climate change.

On [[August 1]] [[2005]], Bush took a controversial stance favoring the teaching of [[Intelligent Design]] alongside [[evolution]] in science classes, saying, "I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought, and I'm not suggesting — you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, and the answer is yes."

====Other issues====
Bush has signed legislation supporting faith-based initiatives, and created the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]] to assist such organizations.

Bush opposes same-sex marriage but supports [[civil unions]]. He endorsed the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]. Bush is the first Republican President to appoint an openly [[gay]] man to his administration.

In regards to what is commonly called [[Affirmative Action]], Bush does not support enforced quotas, but has asked the public and private sector to reach out to minorities. He has drawn criticism from some minority groups on his policies. In total, Bush has appointed more women and minorities to high-level positions within his administration than any other U.S. President.

Bush is a strong supporter of [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]]. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were [[Capital punishment in Texas|executed in that state]], maintaining its record as the leading state in [[execution (legal)|execution]]s. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist [[Timothy McVeigh]].

The Bush administration has threatened [[Veto#United States|presidential veto]] of legislation on several occasions, usually resulting in a compromise report from [[conference committee]].  However, Bush has never yet vetoed a bill.  If this continues, he will become the eighth president to serve without ever vetoing, and the first since [[James Garfield]] in [[1881]].

===Public perception and assessments===
{{main article|[[Public perception and assessments of George W. Bush]]}}
Bush has drawn both supportive praise and harsh criticism. His supporters believe he has done well with the [[Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration|economy]] and homeland security, and shown exemplary leadership after the [[September 11]] attacks. His opponents have disagreed on those very subjects and have also criticized the passage of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|controversial 2000 election]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The magazine ''[[TIME]]'' named Bush as its [[Person of the Year]] for 2000 and for 2004.
[[Image:Bush approval ratings line graph.png|thumb|right|Bush approval rating from February 2001 to December 2005.]] Notable spikes in his approval rating followed the [[September 11]] attacks, and the beginning of the [[2003 Iraq conflict]].

In the time of national crisis following the [[September 11]] attacks, Bush enjoyed approval ratings of greater than 85%. Since then, his approval ratings and approval of handling of domestic, economic, and foreign policy issues have steadily dropped for many reasons.  Polls conducted in early 2006 continue to illustrate an average of around 40% for Bush, up slightly from the following September, but surprisingly low from a president coming off of his [[State of the Union Address]], which generally provides a boost. <ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm PRESIDENT BUSH – Overall Job Rating] - PollingReport.com, accessed [[February 20]], [[2006]] </ref>

Along with the criticism on issues of foreign policy, President Bush has also taken criticism for his domestic policies, such as his administration's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], which many considered slow, or his involvement in the [[Terri Schiavo]] controversy, for which he was harshly criticized by both the left and right for the perceived intrusiveness by the federal government in state matters, and for allegedly exploiting an emotional drama. Bush has also been criticized for his handling of the leak of the name of [[CIA]] agent [[Valerie Plame]] from a source within his administration after promising to fire anyone who leaked the name, and then promising to fire such a person if they are convicted of a crime, which many considered a back-pedal.

As of late 2005 and early 2006, considerable criticism has focused on points such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency#Secret CIA Prisons|CIA Secret Prison]] controversy and the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|NSA domestic monitoring]] of communications.

A multitude of website editors have participated in a so-called "[[Google bomb]]", which returns the official biography of Bush on the White House website, when the phrase "[[Miserable failure]]" is typed into the [[Google]] search engine. <ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Miserable+failure Google search for "miserable failure"]</ref> In response, Bush loyalists have linked the same phrase to Jimmy Carter's official White House biography, so that it returns stacked with the Bush bio as the top Google site for "miserable failure".

===Calls for impeachment===
[[Image:Harpers March 2006.jpg|thumb|The March 2006 cover of [[Harper's Magazine]].]]
{{main article|[[Movement to impeach George W. Bush]]}}

A poll commissioned by [http://www.Afterdowningstreet.org Afterdowningstreet.org] and performed by [[Zogby]], was released in January 2006 showing that a majority of United States of America citizens (52% to 43%) believe Congress should consider impeaching the president if it is shown that he wiretapped US citizens without approval from the courts. 

In 2005 and 2006 there have been several calls for impeachment from Democratic party politicians [[John Conyers|Representative John Conyers]](D-MI) and [[Elizabeth Holtzman|former Representative Elizabeth Holtzman]], as well as actor/activist [[Richard Dreyfuss]] <ref>[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=\Politics\archive\200602\POL20060217a.html Impeaching Bush Is 'Cause Worth Fighting for,' Actor Says] - Randy Hall, [[Cybercast News Service]], [[February 17]], [[2006]]</ref>. Also calling for Bush's impeachment is convicted [[Watergate]] participant and former [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon Administration]] official [[John Dean]].  

In March 2006, [[Harper's Magazine]] published an article by Lewis B Lapham entitled "The Case For Impeachment: Why We Can No Longer Afford George W. Bush". The cover page reads: "IMPEACH HIM: Lewis B. Lapham on the High Crimes of George W. Bush" and the article's inside lead is titled "Is There A Case For Impeachment." Harper's Magazine featured the question of presidential impeachment on its cover before, during the Nixon presidency in 1974.

However, since 1797, the House of Representatives has only impeached 16 Federal officials.  Of those 16, only seven were convicted by the Senate.  Both impeached presidents, [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Bill Clinton]], were acquitted. <ref> [http://www.infoplease.com/spot/impeach.html A Short History of Impeachment] - Borgna Brunner, [[Infoplease]], accessed [[February 20]], [[2006]]</ref>
