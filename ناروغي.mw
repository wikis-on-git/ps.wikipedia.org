'''ناروغي''' د بدن يا د ماغزو غېرنورماله حالت دی چې د نارامۍ ،ناهوساينۍ، د بدن د ناسم کار لامل او ناروغ او د هغه اړونده چاپېريال کې خلکو ته د ناخوښۍ او ځورېدنې او د ناروغۍ د لېږدېدنې سبب ګرځي.
 
A '''disease''' is an abnormal condition of the [[human body|body]] or [[mind]] that causes 
[[discomfort]], [[dysfunction]], or distress to the person afflicted or those in contact with the person. Sometimes the term is used broadly to include injuries, disabilities, [[syndrome]]s, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts these may be considered distinguishable categories.

[[Pathology]] is the study of diseases.  The subject of systematic classification of diseases is referred to as [[nosology]]. The broader body of knowledge about human diseases and their treatments is [[medicine]]. Many similar (and a few of the same) conditions or processes can affect animals (wild or domestic). The study of diseases affecting animals is [[veterinary medicine]]. Plants as well can suffer from a variety of processes such as infection, nutrient deficiency, or deleterious mutation. The study of diseases affecting plants is termed [[plant pathology]]. 

==Syndromes, illness and disease==

Medical usage sometimes distinguishes a ''disease'', which has a known specific cause or causes (called its [[etiology]]), from a ''syndrome'', which is a collection of signs or [[symptom]]s that occur together. However, many conditions have been identified, yet continue to be referred to as "syndromes". Furthermore, numerous conditions of unknown etiology are referred to as "diseases" in many contexts.

[[Illness]], although often used to mean disease, can also refer to a person's ''perception'' of their health, regardless of whether they in fact have a disease.  A person without any disease may feel unhealthy and believe he has an illness.  Another person may feel healthy and believe he does not have an illness even though he may have a disease such as dangerously [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]] which may lead to a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]].

==د ناروغيو لېږدېدنه==
Some diseases, such as [[influenza]], are contagious or [[infection|infectious]], and can be transmitted by any of a variety of mechanisms, including droplets from coughs and sneezes, by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease, from contaminated water or food, etc.	

Other diseases, such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]] are not considered to be due to infection, although micro-organisms may play a role.

==Social significance of disease==
The identification of a condition as a disease, rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function, can have significant social or economic implications. The controversial recognitions as diseases of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], also known as "shell shock"; [[repetitive motion injury]] or [[repetitive stress injury]] (RSI); and [[Gulf War syndrome]] has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments, corporations and institutions towards individuals, as well as on the individuals themselves. The social implication of viewing [[senescence|aging]] as a disease could be profound, though this classification is not yet widespread.

A condition may be considered to be a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others. [[Oppositional-defiant disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], and, increasingly, [[obesity]] are conditions considered to be diseases in the United States and Canada today, but were not so-considered decades ago and are not so-considered in some other countries. [[Leprosy|Lepers]] were a group of afflicted individuals who were historically shunned and the term "leper" still evokes social stigma. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomena, though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma.

A disease can also be caused by repeated high anger or stress.

==Other uses of the term==

In [[biology]], ''disease'' refers to any abnormal condition of an organism that impairs function.

The term ''disease'' is often used metaphorically for disordered, dysfunctional, or distressing conditions of other things, as in ''disease of society''.
