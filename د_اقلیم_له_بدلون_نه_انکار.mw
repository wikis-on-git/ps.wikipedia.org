== د نړیوالې تودوخې په اړه دلیلونه او درېځونه ==
د اقلیم د بدلون ځینې انکار کوونکي ډلې وایي چې: Co2 یوازې په اتموسفیر کې ټریس ګاز دی (تقریباٌ ۴۰۰ppm، یا ۰۰۴٪، په هرو ۱۰۰۰۰ برخوکې۴ )، نو دا په اقلیم باندې لږ اغېز لري.

ساینس پوهان له یوې پېړۍ راهیسې پوهېږي چې، ان دا کوچنۍکچه د تودوخې د پام وړ اغېزې لري او د تناسب دوه چنده کول د تودوخې د لوی زیاتوالي لامل کېږي. <ref name="trace">{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 1: Anthropogenic CO2 can't be changing climate, because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources. Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas, so changes in CO2 are irrelevant."</ref>

ساینسي اجماع، لکه څنګه چې د IPCC څلورم ارزونې راپور، د متحده ایالاتو جیولوژیکي سروې او نورو راپورونو له خوا لنډیز شوی، دا دی چې د انسان فعالیت د اقلیم د بدلون لوی لامل دی.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: " According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anthropogenic CO2 amounts to about 30 billion tons annually—more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce."</ref>

د فوسیل سون توکو سوځول، هر کال شاوخوا ۳۰ ملیارده ټنه Co2 جوړوي، چې ۱۳۰ ځله دا مقدار د ولکانونو په واسطه تولیدېږي.

ځینې ډلې ادعا کوي چې د اوبو تبخیر د شنو خونو ډېر مهم ګاز دی او د ډېرو اقلیمي ماډلونو څخه پاتې دی.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/|title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing?|date=6 April 2005|website=RealClimate|first=David|last=Archer|access-date=5 September 2018|archive-date=1 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200601181505/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/|url-status=live}}</ref>

په داسې حال کې چې د اوبو بخار د شنو خونو ګاز دی، د Co2 په پرتله د اوبو بخار اتموسفیر ژوند شاوخوا ۱۰ ورځې دی؛ په دې معنا چې Co2 د تودوخې د زیاتوالي اصلي عامل دی. د اوبو بخار د غبرګون په توګه کار کوي، نه د جبري میکانیزم په حیث. د اوبو بخارونه د ۱۸۰۰ ز کال په وروستیو کې د اقلیم په ماډلونو کې شامل شوي دي.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "from Arrhenius on, climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models. In fact, water vapor is why rising CO2 has such a big effect on climate&nbsp;... Nevertheless, within this dynamic, the CO2 remains the main driver&nbsp;... of the greenhouse effect."</ref>

د اقلیم انکار ډلې ممکن دا استدلال هم وکړي، چې د نړۍ تودوخې په دې وروستیو کې بندې شوي، د نړیوالې تودوخې ځنډ(وقفه) یا دا چې د نړۍ تودوخه په حقیقت کې کمېږي، چې د نړیوال سړښت سبب ګرځي. دا دلیلونه د لنډ مهاله بدلونونو پر بنسټ ولاړ دي او د تودوخې اوږد مهاله بڼه له پامه غورځوي.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 3: Global warming stopped a decade ago; Earth has been cooling since then."</ref>

دا ګروپونه ډېری وختونه طبیعي تغییراتو ته اشاره کوي، لکه: د لمر ځایونه، کازمیکې وړانګې او د تودوخې ککړتیا تشرېح کولو لپاره. د دې ډلو په وینا: طبیعي بدلونونه شتون لري چې د وخت په تیریدو سره به کم شي او دا په انسان باندې لږه اغېزه لري. دا فکتورنه د مخه په پام کې نیول شوي دي. کله چې د اقلیم ماډلونه رامنځته شول او ساینسي اجماع دا ده، چې دوی نه شي کولی، د تودوخې لیدل شوې ککړتیا تشېح کړي.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 4: The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely to be the real causes of global warming. After all, Mars is warming up, too."</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles, there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures."</ref>

په ۲۰۱۸ ز کال د مې په میاشت کې، د ساینس، فضا او ټیکنالوژۍ په اړه د متحده ایالاتو د کور کمېټې په غونډه کې، د الاباما استازي مو بروکس ادعا وکړه چې:  د سمندر د سطحې لوړولی د ګلیشیرونو د خړوبولو له امله نه، بلکې د ساحلي تخریب او خټو له امله رامنځته کېږي چې له سیندونو نه سمندر ته تېریږي.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Scott|title=Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/republican-lawmaker-rocks-tumbling-ocean-causing-sea-level-rise|access-date=17 May 2018|publisher=Science|date=17 May 2018|archive-date=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517165517/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/republican-lawmaker-rocks-tumbling-ocean-causing-sea-level-rise|url-status=live}}</ref>

زیاتره ادبیات د اقلیم بدلون ردوي او دا وړاندیز کوي چې، موږ باید د اقلیم بدلون ته له رسیدو نه مخکې غوره ټیکنالوژیو ته انتظار وباسو، ځکه چې دا به ډېره ارزانه او اغېزمنه وي.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 7: [[Technological fix|Technological fixes]], such as inventing energy sources that don't produce CO2 or geoengineering the climate, would be more affordable, prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint."</ref>
