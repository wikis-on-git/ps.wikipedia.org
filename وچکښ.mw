==تاريخ==
{{ژباړل}}
The [[archetypal]] pencil may have been the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] stylus, which was a thin metal stick, often made of [[lead]] and used for scratching on [[papyrus]], a form of early paper. The word ''pencil'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''pencillus'' which means "little tail."

===د ګرېفايټ د زېرمو موندنه===
Some time prior to 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), an enormous deposit of [[graphite]] was discovered at the site of [[Seathwaite Fell]] near [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. The locals found that it was very useful for marking [[sheep]]. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. This was and remains the only deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. [[Chemistry]] was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called ''plumbago'' (Latin for "lead ore"). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/plumbago |title=Definition of Plumbago |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/plumbago |title=Definition of Plumbago |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> The black core of pencils is still sometimes referred to as "lead," even though it never contained the [[Chemical element|element]] lead.

The value of graphite was soon realized to be enormous, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for [[cannon]] balls, and the mines were taken over by the [[The Crown|Crown]] and guarded. Graphite had to be smuggled out for use in pencils. Because graphite is soft, it requires some form of case. Graphite sticks were at first wrapped in string or in [[Leather|sheepskin]] for stability. The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide, attracting the attentions of artists all over the "known world."

Although deposits of graphite had been found in other parts of the world, they were not of the same purity and quality as the Borrowdale find, and had to be crushed to remove the impurities, leaving only graphite powder. England continued to enjoy a [[monopoly]] on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found. The distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the [[1860s]]. Today, the town of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], near the original findings of block graphite, has a pencil [[museum]].
The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], in [[1662]]. It used a mixture of graphite, [[sulfur|sulphur]], and [[antimony]].

It was the [[Italians]] who first thought of [[wood]]en holders. An Italian couple in particular, named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti, were believed to be the ones to create the first blueprints for the modern carpentry pencil for the purpose of marking their carpentry pieces; however, their version was instead a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. They did this at first by hollowing out a stick of [[juniper]] wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the two halves then glued together&mdash;essentially the same method in use to this day. 

English and German pencils were not available to the [[France|French]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. It took the efforts of an officer in [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s army to change this. In [[1795]] [[Nicholas Jacques Conté]] discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with [[clay]] and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a [[kiln]]. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian [[Joseph Hardtmuth]] of [[Koh-I-Noor (company)|Koh-I-Noor]] in 1790 remains in present use.

American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the [[American Revolution]]. [[Benjamin Franklin]] advertised pencils for sale in his ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' in 1729, and [[George Washington]] used a three-inch pencil when he surveyed the [[Ohio Territory]] in 1762. It is said that William Munroe, a cabinetmaker in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], made the first American wood pencils in 1812. This was not the only pencil-making in Concord. According to [[Henry Petroski]], [[transcendentalist]] philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]] discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder; this invention was prompted by his father's pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in [[New Hampshire]] in 1821 by Charles Dunbar.

[[Image:Pencil manufacture.svg|thumb|right|200px|Pencil manufacturing. The top sequence shows the old method that required pieces of graphite to be cut to size; the lower sequence is the new, current method using rods of graphite and clay.]]
Munroe's method of making pencils was painstakingly slow, and in the neighbouring town of [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook along the old Davis Road. He used the first circular saw in pencil production. He constructed the first hexagon- and octagon-shaped pencil cases that we have today. Ebenezer did not patent his invention and shared his techniques with whoever asked. One of those was [[Eberhard Faber]] of New York, who became the leader in pencil production.

[[Joseph Dixon]], an inventor and entrepreneur involved with the [[Tantiusques]] granite [[Mining|mine]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]], developed a means to [[mass production|mass produce]] pencils.  By [[1870]], The [[Joseph Dixon Crucible Company]] was the world’s largest dealer and consumer of graphite and later became the contemporary [[Dixon Ticonderoga]] pencil and art supplies company.<ref>[http://www.dixonusa.com/index.cfm/fuseaction=history.dixon Dixon Ticonderoga Company]</ref><ref>[http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/368_tantiusques.cfm Tantiusques Graphite Mine]</ref>

Modern pencils are made industrially by mixing finely ground graphite and clay powders, adding water, forming long [[spaghetti]]-like strings, and firing them in a [[kiln]] (thermally insulated chambers). The resulting strings are dipped in [[oil]] or molten [[wax]], which seeps into the tiny holes of the material, resulting in smoother writing. A juniper or [[incense-cedar]] plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to make something called a slat, and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole thing is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted.

Many pencils across the world and almost all in Europe are graded on the European system using a continuüm from "H" (for hardness) to "B" (for blackness), as well as "F" (for fine point). The standard writing pencil is graded '''HB'''.  According to Petrosky this system might have been developed in the early 1900s by Brookman (an English pencil maker) which used "B" for black and "H" for hard; a pencil's grade was described by a sequence or successive Hs or Bs such as '''BB''' and '''BBB''' for successively softer leads, and '''HH''' and '''HHH''' for successively harder ones.<ref>Petrosky 1990, page 157</ref>.

Today a set of  pencils ranging from a very hard, light-marking pencil to a very soft, black-marking pencil usually ranges from hardest to softest as follows.

Koh-i-noor offers twenty grades from 10H to 8B for its 1500 series<ref>http://www.koh-i-noor.cz/main/main.php?pageid=3211&lang=4&=&filter=&cat=24&position=30 Koh-i-noor Catalog: Graphite Pencis</ref>; Derwent produces twenty grades from 9B to 9H for its Graphic pencils <ref>http://www.pencils.co.uk/products/derwent.aspx?sid=3&p=1 Derwent Graphic, retrieved Aug 21, 2007</ref> and Staedtler produces sixteen from 8B to 6H for its Mars Lumograph pencils.<ref>http://www.staedtler.com/Mars_Lumograph_gb.Staedtler?ActiveID=2213 Staedtler Mars Lumograph Pencils, retrieved Aug 21, 2007</ref> The main market for such wide range of grades are artists who are interested in creating a full range of tones from light grey to black; while engineers prefer harder pencils which allow for a greater control in the shape of the lead. This is reflected in the way pencils are packaged and marketed. For example, for its Graphic pencils Derwent offers three packages of 12 pencils each: Technical (with hard grades from B to 9H), Sketching (with soft grades 9B to H), and Designer (with medium grades 6B to 4H). 

Pencils graded using this system are used to measure the hardness and resistance of varnishes and paints. The resistance of a coating (also known as its pencil hardness) is determined as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle.<ref>This testing method is approved by the [[ISO]] as standard ISO 15184:1998 Paints and varnishes -- Determination of film hardness by pencil test http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=47996. See http://www.pra-world.com/technical/testingphysicalhardness.htm for a description of the test. Unfortunately the hardness of pencils are not standardized. For this reason the standard specifies various brands of pencils that are to be used in this test.</ref><ref>

Another common method uses numbers to designated the grade of a pencil. It was originally created by Conté and adopted in the United States by Thoreau  in the 19th century<ref>Petrosky claims that Conté used integer numbers that started at 1, with higher numbers indicating softer leads, while Thoreau used higher numbers to designate harder leads (Petrosky, 1990, page 157). It is believed that Thoreau developed independently his method of mixing clay and graphite, and his use of numbers to designate grades is evidence that he was at least aware of Conté methods and tried to reverse engineer them. Thoreau offered pencils graduated from 1 to 4 in the middle 1800s (Petrosky, 1990, page 119), see also {{cite episode |transcripturl=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi339.htm |series=The Engines of Our Ingenuity |serieslink=The Engines of Our Ingenuity |number=339 |title=Thoreau's Pencils |airdate=1989 |credits=John H.

The various graphite pencil grades are achieved by altering the proportion of graphite to clay: the more clay the harder the pencil<ref>http://www.staedtler.com/upload/graphite_video_eng_16461.mpg "Staedtler Pencil", video, retrieved Aug 21, 2007.</ref><ref>Petrosky, 1990)</ref><ref>http://www.pencils.co.uk/heritage.aspx?id=6&sid=1 Derwent Manufacturing Process, retrieved Aug 21, 2007</ref>. Two pencils of the same grade but different manufactures will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness<ref>Petrosky claims that pencil grades vary "depending upon the manufacturer, when the pencils are made, and the source of graphite and clay. One analyst found that graphitic carbon content, for example, to vary from about 30 to about 65 in a variety of different pencils bearing the same designation." Petrosky, 1990, page 229</ref>.

The majority of pencils made in the [[United States]] are painted [[yellow]]. <ref>75% of the 2.8 billion pencils made in the United States are painted yellow (Steve Ritter "Pencils & Pencil Lead", Chemical & Engineering News, Volume 79, Number 42 page 35, Oct 15, 2001 http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/stuff/7942sci4.html).</ref> According to [[Henry Petroski]] <ref>Petrosky, 1990, pages 162-163</ref>, this tradition began in [[1890]] when the L. & C. Hardtmuth Company of [[Austria-Hungary]] introduced their [[Koh-I-Noor (company)|Koh-I-Noor]] brand, named after the [[Koh-i-Noor|famous diamond]]. It was intended to be the world's best and most expensive pencil, and at a time when most pencils were either painted in dark colours or not at all, the Koh-I-Noor was yellow. As well as simply being distinctive, the colour may have been inspired by the [[Austria-Hungary#Flags and heraldry of Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian flag]]; it was also suggestive of [[the Orient]], at a time when the best-quality graphite came from [[Siberia]]. Other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencils would be associated with this high-quality brand, and chose brand names with explicit Oriental references, such as Mikado (renamed Mirado<ref>Eagle Pencil Company applied for the trademark [[Mirado]] in 1947 (US Trademark 71515261). It is common belief that this was an attempt to disassociate the pencil brand from Japan, as one of the meanings of [[Mikado]] is emperor of Japan. Petrosky (Petrosky, 1990) states that Eagle Pencil Company changed the name after the [[Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor]].</ref><ref>Mikado/Mirado pencils were originally made by [[Eagle Pencil Company]]--today [[Berol]]--but it can also be found today under the trademark [[Papermate]] and [[Sanford]] as Sanford owns Berol and the trademark Papermate http://www.brandnamepencils.com/brands/eagle/mikado174.shtml Mirado Pencil</ref>) and Mongol. <ref>http://www.pencilpages.com/gallery/eberhard-faber/mongol.htm Eberhard Faber Pencil Gallery.</ref><ref>Originally made by [[Eberhard Faber]] the Mongol trademark is now owned by Sanford http://timberlines.blogspot.com/2005/08/mongolized.html Timberlines Blog "Mongolized" Aug 31, 2005, retrieved Aug 23, 2007</ref>

Not all countries use yellow pencils, however; [[Germany|German]] pencils, for example, are often [[green]], based on the trademark colours of [[Faber-Castell]], a major German stationery company. Pencils are commonly round, [[hexagonal]] or sometimes [[triangle|triangular]] in section.

Pencils are students' primary writing instruments. Due to this common usage, the pencil is a common cause of minor puncture injuries in young children. The tip of the lead may leave a grey mark inside the skin for years. This led to the [[old wives' tale]] that the lead bits could be passed through the blood vessels into the brain, causing [[mental retardation]] in those with such a wound. Pencil "lead" is graphite ([[carbon]]) and not the chemical element [[lead]]. Residual graphite from a pencil stick does not seem to be poisonous, and graphite is generally harmless if consumed.<ref>[http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC33124 Graphite  - Identification, toxicity, use, water pollution potential, ecological toxicity and regulatory information]</ref>

There are also [[mechanical pencil]]s, which use mechanical methods to push lead through a hole at the end. The erasers are also removable (and thus replaceable), and usually cover a place to store replacement leads. Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity and the fact that they never need sharpening.

Lead types are based on thickness. Common sizes are 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, and 1.6 [[millimetre]]s. The 2.0 mm size is commonly used in designing, artwork, and engineering, but is not commonly used outside these fields due to its high cost. This largest size usually cannot be sharpened in [[pencil sharpeners]]: a variety of devices are used, mostly abrasive.

An [[urban legend]] in circulation since the [[1970s]] (and told on a 2002 episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'') tells of [[NASA]] spending large sums of money, typically in the millions of dollars, to develop an instrument that would write in space (a [[space pen]]). The typical punch line is that either someone supposedly should have sent NASA a pencil, or that the [[Soviet space program|Soviets]] used pencils. 

While considered humorous, the story is not true.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp ''The Write Stuff'', Snopes.  January 16, 2007.]</ref> In fact, graphite pencils were used on all Mercury and Gemini space flights, and were replaced by pressurized "[[Space Pen|space pens]]" (independently developed without NASA funding) after the [[Apollo 1]] fire. Pencils are, in fact, still used in space, for example aboard the [[International Space Station]].
