{{ژباړل}}
The term also encompasses the related [[science|scientific]] study of disease processes, called [[General pathology]]. 

Medical pathology is divided in two main branches, [[Anatomical pathology]] and [[Clinical pathology]]. [[Veterinary pathology]] is concerned with animal disease whereas [[Phytopathology]] is the study of plant diseases.

==د رنڅپوهنې تاريخ==
{{Main|History of pathology}}
The history of pathology can be traced to the earliest application of the [[scientific method]] to the field of [[medicine]], a development which occurred in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. 

Early systematic human [[dissection]]s were carried out by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] physicians [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus of Chios]] in the early part of the third century BC.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1285450 The discovery of the body: human dissection and it...[Yale J Biol Med. 1992 May-Jun&#93; - PubMed Result]</ref> The first physician known to have made [[Autopsy|postmortem]] [[dissection]]s was the [[Arab]]ian physician [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] (1091–1161).  [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902) is generally recognized to be the father of microscopic pathology.  Most early pathologists were also practicing [[physician]]s or [[surgeon]]s.

{{Main|General pathology}}
General pathology, also called investigative pathology, experimental pathology or theoretical pathology,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} is a broad and complex [[science|scientific field]] which seeks to understand the mechanisms of injury to [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], as well as the body's means of responding to and repairing injury. Areas of study include cellular adaptation to injury, [[necrosis]], [[inflammation]], [[wound healing]] and [[neoplasia]]. It forms the foundation of pathology, the application of this knowledge to diagnose diseases in  humans and [[veterinary pathology|animals]]. 

The term "general pathology" is also used to describe the practice of both [[anatomical pathology|anatomical]] and [[clinical pathology]].

==رنځپوهنه د يوه طبي تخصص په توګه==
{{Main|Pathology as a medical specialty}}
Pathologists are physicians who diagnose and characterize disease in living patients by examining [[Biopsy|biopsies]] or [[bodily fluid]]. The vast majority of [[cancer]] diagnoses are made or confirmed by a pathologist. Pathologists may also conduct [[autopsy|autopsies]] to investigate causes of death. Pathology is a core discipline of [[medical school]] and many pathologists are also teachers. As managers of [[Medical laboratory|medical laboratories]], pathologists play an important role in the development of [[Laboratory information system]]s. Although the medical practice of pathology grew out of the tradition of [[General pathology|investigative pathology]], most modern pathologists do not perform original research.

Pathology is a unique medical specialty in that pathologists typically do not see [[patient]]s directly, but rather serve as consultants to other physicians (often referred to as "clinicians" within the pathology community). To be licensed, candidates must complete medical training, an approved residency program and be certified by an appropriate body. In the US, certification is by the [[American Board of Pathology]]. The organization of subspecialties within pathology varies between nations, but usually includes [[anatomical pathology]] and [[clinical pathology]].

{{Main|Anatomical pathology}}
Anatomical pathology (''Commonwealth'') or Anatomic pathology (''U.S.'') is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the [[gross examination|gross]], [[Histopathology|microscopic]], chemical, immunologic and [[Molecular pathology|molecular]] examination of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], and whole bodies ([[autopsy]]).  

Anatomical pathology is itself divided in subspecialties, the main ones being [[surgical pathology]], [[cytopathology]] and [[forensic pathology]]. To be [[Medical license|licensed]] to practice pathology, one has to complete [[medical school]] and secure a license to practice medicine.  An approved [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] program and certification (in the U.S., the [[American board of Pathology]]) is usually required to obtain employment or hospital privileges. 

Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being [[clinical pathology]], the diagnosis of disease through the [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] analysis of [[bodily fluid]]s and/or tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as [[general pathology]]. The distinction between anatomic and clinical pathology is increasingly blurred by the introduction of technologies that require new expertise and the need to provide patients and referring physicians with integrated diagnostic reports.  Similar specialties exist in [[veterinary pathology]].

===کلينيکي رنځپوهنه===
{{Main|Clinical pathology}}
Clinical pathology or Biomedical Science (UK), is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] analysis of [[bodily fluid]]s such as [[blood]] and [[urine]], and tissues using the tools of [[clinical chemistry|chemistry]], [[Clinical microbiology|microbiology]], [[hematology]] and [[molecular pathology]].  Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with [[medical technologist]]s hospital administrations and referring physicians to insure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing. 

Clinical pathology is one of the two major divisions of pathology, the other being [[anatomical pathology]]. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination sometimes known as general pathology.

==Forensic pathology==
{{Main|Forensic pathology}}
Forensic pathology is a branch of pathology concerned with determining the [[cause of death]] by examination of a [[cadaver]]. The [[autopsy]] is performed by the pathologist at the request of a [[coroner]] usually during the investigation of [[criminal law]] cases and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases in some [[jurisdictions]]. Forensic pathologists are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a cadaver. 

Forensic pathology is that branch of medicine,which deals with the study of cause of death by examination  of a dead body at the request of a coroner during legal cases.

The word [[forensics]] is derived from the Latin ''forēnsis'' meaning ''forum''.

{{Main|Veterinary pathology|veterinary pathologist}}
Veterinary pathologists are [[veterinarians|doctors of veterinary medicine]] who specialise in the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of diseases through the examination of animal tissue and body fluids. Like for medical pathology, veterinary pathology is divided in two branches, [[anatomical pathology]] and [[clinical pathology]]. Veterinary pathologists are critical participants in the drug development process.

{{Main|Phytopathology}}
Plant pathology (also phytopathology) is the scientific study of plant diseases caused by pathogens (infectious diseases) and environmental conditions (physiological factors).  Organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants.  Not included are insects, mites, vertebrate or other pests that affect plant health by consumption of plant tissues.  Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, [[plant disease epidemiology]], [[plant disease resistance]], how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases. 

The ''"Disease triangle"'' is a central concept of plant pathology<ref name=Arios>George N. Agrios (1997) Plant Pathology fourth edition, Academic Press. New York.</ref>. It is based on the principle that infectious diseases develop, or do not develop, based on three-way interactions between the host, the pathogen and environmental conditions.

==ماليکولي رنځپوهنه==
Molecular pathology is an emerging discipline within pathology which is focused in the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids.
Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[proteomics]] and [[genetics]], and is sometimes considered a "crossover" discipline. 
It is multi-disciplinary in nature and focuses mainly on the sub-microscopic aspects of disease.

It is a scientific discipline that encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human tumours, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression, the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to develop cancer and the environmental and lifestyle factors implicated in carcinogenesis[http://www.molecularpathology.org.uk/].
