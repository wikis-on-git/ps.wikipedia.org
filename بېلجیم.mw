The '''Kingdom of Belgium''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Koninkrijk België''; [[French language|French]]: ''Royaume de Belgique''; [[German language|German]]: ''Königreich Belgien'') is a country in [[Western Europe|northwest Europe]] bordered by [[نېدرلانډ/هالېنډ]], [[جرمني/آلمان]], [[لېکسامبورګ]] and [[فرانسه]]. Belgium has a population of over ten million people in an area of thirty thousand square kilometres (11,700&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]).  Straddling the cultural boundary between [[Germanic language|Germanic]] and [[Romance language|Romance]] Europe, it is both linguistically and culturally divided. Two major languages are spoken in Belgium: Dutch—sometimes unofficially called [[Flemish (linguistics)|Flemish]]—spoken in [[Flanders]] to the north; and French, spoken in [[Walloon Region|Wallonia]] in the south. The capital, [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]], is officially bilingual, while the majority of its residents speaks French. An officially recognized minority of [[German language|German]] speakers is present in the east. This linguistic diversity often leads to political conflict, and is reflected in Belgium's complex [[Communities, regions and provinces of Belgium|system of government]] and [[history of Belgium|political history]]. 

Belgium derives its name from its first named inhabitants, the ''[[Belgae]]'', a group of mostly [[Celt]]ic tribes, and from the [[Roman province]] in northern [[Gaul]], known as [[Gallia Belgica]]. Historically, Belgium has been a part of the [[Low Countries]], which also include the Netherlands and Luxembourg and were covering a somewhat larger region than the current [[Benelux]] group of states. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the seventeenth century, it was a prosperous center of commerce and culture. From the sixteenth century until independence in 1830, Belgium, called at that time [[Southern Netherlands|the Southern Netherlands]], was the site of many battles between the European powers, and has been dubbed "the [[Cockpit]] of Europe."{{ref|Nuttall}} More recently, Belgium was a founding member of the [[European Union]], hosting its headquarters, as well as those of other major international organisations, such as [[NATO]].

== تاريخ ==
{{main|History of Belgium}}
Over the past two millennia, the area that is now known as Belgium has seen significant demographic, political and cultural upheavals. The first well-documented population move was the conquest of the region by the [[Roman Republic]] in the 1st century [[Anno Domini|BC]], followed in the 5th century by the [[Germanic people|Germanic]] [[Frank]]s. The Franks established the [[Merovingian]] kingdom, which became the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 8th century. During the Middle Ages, the Low Countries were split into many small [[feudal]] states. Most of them were united in the course of the 14th and 15th centuries by the house of [[Burgundy]] as the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. These states gained a degree of autonomy in the 15th century and were thereafter named the [[Seventeen Provinces]].

|}
The history of Belgium can be distinguished from that of the Low Countries from the 16th century. A [[civil war]], the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648), divided the Seventeen Provinces into the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] in the north and the [[Southern Netherlands]] in the south. The southern provinces were ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[History of Austria#Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711-1780)|Austrian]] [[Habsburg]]s. Until independence, the Southern Netherlands were sought after by numerous French conquerors and were the theatre of most [[Early Modern France#France in the 17th and 18th centuries|Franco-Spanish and Franco-Austrian wars]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the  [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries—including territories that were never under Habsburg rule, such the [[Bishopric of Liège]]—were overrun by France, ending Spanish-Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] occurred at the end of the [[first French Empire|French Empire]] in 1815. 

The 1830 [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the establishment of an [[independence|independent]], [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and neutral Belgium under a provisional government. Since the installation of [[Leopold I]] as king in 1831, Belgium has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]]. Between independence and [[World War II]], the democratic system evolved from an [[oligarchy]] characterised by two main parties, the Catholics and the Liberals, to a [[universal suffrage]] system that has included a third party, the [[Belgian Labour Party]], and a strong role for the [[trade union]]s. Originally, French, which was the adopted language of the [[nobility]] and the [[bourgeoisie]] was the official language. The country has since developed a bilingual Dutch-French system.

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 agreed to hand over [[Colonisation of the Congo|Congo]] to [[Léopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] as his private possession, called the [[Congo Free State]]. In 1908, it was ceded to Belgium as a colony, henceforth called the [[Belgian Congo]]. Belgium's neutrality was violated in 1914, when Germany invaded Belgium as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. The former [[German colonies]] [[Ruanda-Urundi]]—now called [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]—were occupied by the Belgian Congo in 1916. They were mandated in 1924 to Belgium by the [[League of Nations]]. Belgium was again invaded by Germany in 1940 during the [[blitzkrieg]] offensive. The Belgian Congo gained its independence on [[30 July]] [[1960]] during the [[Congo Crisis]], and Ruanda-Urundi became independent in 1962.

After World War II, Belgium joined NATO and, together with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, formed the [[Benelux]] group of nations. Belgium was also one of the founding members of the [[European Economic Community]]. Belgium hosts the headquarters of NATO and a major part of the [[European Union]]'s institutions and administrations, including the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and most of the sessions of the [[European Parliament]]. During the 20th century, and in particular since World War II, the history of Belgium has been increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main language communities. This period saw a rise in intercommunal tensions, and the unity of the Belgian state has come under scrutiny.{{ref|language_BBC}} Through constitutional reforms in the 1970s and 1980s, [[regionalisation]] of the unitary state had led to the establishment of a three-tiered system of [[federalism]], linguistic-community and regional governments, a compromise designed to minimise linguistic tensions. Nowadays, these federal entities uphold more legislative power than the national bicameral parliament.

{{main|Politics of Belgium}}
[[دوتنه:Gverof.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Guy Verhofstadt]], Prime Minister since July 1999]]

Belgium is a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[popular monarchy]] and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] that evolved after World War II from a [[unitary state]] to a [[federation]]. The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]] is composed of a [[Senate]] and a [[Chamber of Representatives]]. The former is a mix of directly elected senior politicians and representatives of the communities and regions; while the latter represents all Belgians over the age of eighteen in a [[proportional representation|proportional voting]] system. Belgium is one of the few countries that has [[compulsory voting]], thus having one of the highest rates of [[voter turnout]] in the world.{{ref|turnout}}

The federal government, formally nominated by the king, must have the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives. It is led by the [[Prime Minister]]. The numbers of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers are equal as prescribed by the  Constitution.{{ref|minister}} The King or Queen is the [[head of state]], though he has limited [[Royal Prerogative |prerogatives]]. Actual power is vested in the Prime Minister and the [[list of Governments in Belgium|different governments]], who govern the country. The judicial system is based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and originates from the [[Napoleonic code]]. The [[Court of Appeals]] is one level below the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], an institution based on the [[Cour de cassation|French Court of Cassation]].

Belgium's political institutions are complex; most political power is organised around the need to represent the main language communities. Since around 1970, the significant national Belgian [[political party|political parties]] has split into distinct components that mainly represent the interests of these communities. The major parties in each community belong to three main political families: the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Liberals]], the [[centrism|centrist]] [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democrats]], and the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Social Democracy|Social Democrats]]. Other important younger parties are the [[worldwide green parties|Green parties]] and, especially in Flanders, the [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[far-right]] parties. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as [[trade union]]s and business interests in the form of the [[Federation of Enterprises in Belgium]].


The current king, [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]], succeeded King [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]] in 1993. In 1999, Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] from the [[Flemish Liberals and Democrats|VLD]] has led a six-party Liberal-Social Democrat-Greens [[coalition]], often referred to as 'the rainbow government'. This was the first government without the Christian Democrats since 1958.{{ref|rainbow_BBC}} In the [[Belgian general election, 2003|2003 elections]], Verhofstadt won a second term in office and has led a Liberal-Social Democrat coalition of four parties.{{ref|chambre}} More recently however, the steady rise of the Flemish ultra-right nationalist [[separatism|separatist]] party [[Vlaams Belang]], has superseded the [[Flemish Block|Vlaams Blok]] amidst concerns of racism promoted by the party. {{ref|VB_expa}}{{ref|VB_BBC}} 

A significant achievement of the two successive Verhofstadt governments has been the achievement of a balanced budget; Belgium is one of the few member-states of the EU to have done so. This policy was applied by the successive governments during the 1990s under pressure from the [[European Council]]. The fall of the previous government was mainly due to the [[dioxin]] crisis,{{ref|dioxin}} a major food intoxication scandal in 1999 that led to the establishment of the Belgian Food Agency.{{ref|food}} This event resulted in an atypically large representation by the Greens in parliament, and a greater emphasis on environmental politics during the first Verhofstadt government. One Green policy, for example, resulted in [[nuclear power phase-out#Belgium|nuclear phase-out]] legislation, which has been modified by the current government. The absence of Christian Democrats from the ranks of the government has enabled Verhofstadt to tackle social issues from a more [[liberalism|liberal]] point of view and to develop new legislation on the use of [[soft drug]]s, [[same-sex marriage in Belgium|same-sex marriage]] and [[euthanasia#Belgium|euthanasia]]. During the two most recent parliaments, the government has promoted active diplomacy in Africa,{{ref|rwanda}} opposed a military intervention during the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], and has passed legislation concerning [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)|war crimes]]. Both of Verhofstadt's terms have been marked by disputes between the Belgian communities. The major points of contention are the nocturnal air traffic routes at [[Brussels Airport]] and the status of the electoral district of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]].

== Communities and regions ==
{{main|Communities, regions and provinces of Belgium}}
[[دوتنه:350px-Belgium RegProv border.jpg|250px|right|thumbnail|Belgium is composed of the five northern Dutch-speaking provinces of [[Flanders]], the five southern French-speaking provinces of [[Wallonia]] (the [[German-speaking community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] is located in the [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]] along the German border) and the bilingual [[Brussels-Capital Region|Capital Region of Brussels]].  The boundary between these regions is marked in red.]]

The country's constitution was revised on [[14 July]] [[1993]] to create a unique federal state, based on three levels:
#The federal government, based in Brussels.
#The three language communities:
#* the [[Flemish Community|Flemish (i.e., Dutch-speaking) Community]]; 
#* the [[French Community of Belgium|French (i.e., French-speaking) Community]]; and
#* the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]].
# The three regions (which differ from the language communities with respect to the German-speaking community and the Brussels region):
#* the [[Flemish Region]];
#* the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]; and
#* the [[Brussels-Capital Region]].
Conflicts between the bodies are resolved by the [[Court of Arbitration of Belgium|Court of Arbitration]]. The setup allows a compromise so distinctly different cultures can live together peacefully.  

The Flemish Community absorbed the Flemish Region in 1980 to form the government of [[Flanders]]{{ref|flanders}}. The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region is included in both Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region.  Flemish and Walloon regions are furthermore subdivided in administrative entities, the provinces. 

At the highest level of this three-tiered setup is the [[Belgian federal government|federal government]] which manages [[foreign affairs]], [[development aid]], [[defense (military)|defence]], [[Belgium/Military|military]], police, economic management, [[social welfare]], [[social security]] transport, energy, telecommunications, and scientific research, limited competencies in education and culture, and the supervision of taxation by regional authorities. The federal government controls more than 90 per cent of all taxation. The community governments are responsible for the promotion of language, culture and education in mostly schools, libraries and theatres. The third tier is the Regional governments, who manage mostly land and property based issues such as housing, transportation etc. For example, the building permit for a school building in Brussels belonging to the public school system would be regulated by the regional government of Brussels. However, the school as an institution would fall under the regulations of the Flemish government if the primary language of teaching is Dutch, but under the French Community government if the primary language is French.

{{main|Geography of Belgium}}
[[دوتنه:Be-map.gif|thumb|200px| [[Brussels]], [[Antwerp]] (Antwerpen), [[Ghent]] (Gent), [[Charleroi]], [[Liège (city)|Liège]], [[Bruges]] (Brugge) and [[Namur (city)|Namur]] are the seven largest cities of Belgium, with populations above 100,000]]

Belgium, with an area of 30,528 [[square kilometre]]s (11,787&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west, the central plateau, and the [[Ardennes]] uplands in the south-east. The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and [[polder]]s. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] or, further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. The second geographical region, the central plateau, lies further inland. This is a smooth, slowly rising area that has many fertile valleys and is irrigated by many waterways. Here one can also find rougher land, including caves and small [[gorge]]s.

[[دوتنه:Hautes-Fagnes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Landscape in the [[Hautes Fagnes]], in the Ardennes]]

The third geographical region, called the Ardennes, is more rugged than the first two. It is a thickly forested plateau, very rocky and not very good for farming, which extends into northern France. This is where much of Belgium's wildlife can be found.  Belgium's highest point, the [[Signal de Botrange]] is located in this region at only 694&nbsp;[[metre]]s (2,277&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]).

The climate is maritime [[temperate]], with significant precipitation in all seasons ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb''; the average temperature is 3°C (37°F) in January, and 18°[[Celsius|C]] (64°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in July; the average precipitation is 65&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (2.6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in January, and 78&nbsp;millimetres (3.1&nbsp;in) in July).{{ref|meteo}}

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|Economy of Belgium}}
Densely populated, Belgium is located at the heart of one of the world's most highly industrialised regions.

[[دوتنه:Ougree_16.jpg|thumb|300px|Steelmaking along the [[Meuse]] at [[Ougrée]], near [[Liège (city)|Liège]].]]
Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the [[Industrial Revolution]], in the early 1800s. [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and [[Charleroi]] rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the mid-20th century. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846–50).  After World War II, [[Ghent]] and [[Antwerp]] experienced a fast expansion of the [[chemical]] and [[petroleum]] industries. The [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] sent the economy into a prolonged recession. The Belgian steel industry has since experienced serious decline. This has been responsible for inhibiting the economic development of [[Wallonia]].{{ref|state_dpt}} In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of the country continued to shift northwards to Flanders. Nowadays, industry is concentrated in the populous Flemish area in the north. 

By the end of the 1980s, Belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of [[GDP]]. Currently, although the government has recently succeeded in balancing its budget, public debt is nearly 100% of GDP.{{ref|state_dpt}} In 2004, the real growth rate of GDP was estimated at 2.7% {{ref|nationalBank}} but is expected to fall to 1.3% in 2005.{{ref|economist}} 

Belgium has a particularly [[open economy]]. It has developed an excellent [[transportation in Belgium|transportation infrastructure]] of ports, canals, [[Rail transport in Belgium|railways]] and highways to integrate its industry with that of its neighbours. Antwerp is the second-largest European port. One of the founding members of the European Union, Belgium strongly supports the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate the member economies. In 1999, Belgium adopted the [[euro]], the single European currency, which replaced the [[Belgian franc]] in 2002. The Belgian economy is strongly oriented towards foreign trade, in particular of high value-added goods. The main imports are food products, machinery, rough diamonds, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, clothing and accessories, and textiles. The main exports are automobiles, food and food products, iron and steel, finished diamonds, textiles, plastics, petroleum products, and nonferrous metals. Since 1922, Belgium and [[Luxembourg]] have been a single trade market within a [[customs union|customs]] and [[currency union]]—the [[Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union]]. Its main trading partners are Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States and Spain. Belgium ranks ninth on the 2005 [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Belgium}}
The [[population density]] (342 per km&sup2; or 886 per sq.&nbsp;mi) is one of the highest in Europe, after the Netherlands and some smaller countries such as [[Monaco]]. The areas with the highest population density are around the Brussels-Antwerp-Ghent-[[Leuven]] agglomerations, also known as the [[Flemish Diamond]], as well as other important urban centres as Liège, [[Charleroi]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Bruges]], [[Hasselt]] and  [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. The Ardennes have the lowest density. As of 2005, the Flemish Region has a population of about 6,043,161, Wallonia 3,395,942 and Brussels 1,006,749.{{ref|statbel}} Almost all of the population is urban (97.3% in 1999{{ref|undp}}). The main cities and their populations are Brussels (1,006,749), Antwerp (457,749), Ghent (230,951), Charleroi (201,373), Liège (185,574) and Bruges (117,351).{{ref|statbel}}

[[دوتنه:Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]], [[Brussels]]. The basilica is the National Basilica of Belgium. It stands as a symbol of the historical link between the [[List of Belgian monarchs|Belgian monarchy]] and the Catholic Church.]]
About 60% of the country is Dutch-speaking, 40% French-speaking, and 1% German-speaking. Brussels is officially French-Dutch bilingual, but mostly French speaking; it evolved from a Dutch-speaking place to its current dominantly French character when the Belgian state became independent in 1830, with at that time only French as an official language (although the majority of the people spoke Dutch).

Both the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spoken in Belgium and the [[Belgian French]] have minor differences in [[vocabulary]] and [[semantic]] nuances from the varieties spoken in France and the Netherlands. Many people can still speak [[dialects]] of [[Flemish (linguistics)|Flemish]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. These dialects, along with some other ones like [[Picard language|Picard]] or [[Limburgish]],{{ref|ethnologue}} are not used in public life.

The ''[[laicite|laïque]]'' constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. According to the ''2001 Survey and Study of Religion'',{{ref|religion}} about 47% of the population identify themselves as belonging to the Catholic Church. According to these figures, the Muslim population is the second largest religious community, at 3.5% (see [[Religion in Belgium]]). Since independence, Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong [[freethought]] and especially [[freemason]] movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics, in particular via the Christian trade union ([[CSC/ACV]]) and the Christian Democrat parties ([[CD&V]], [[CDH]]).

The vast majority of Belgians are [[Flemings|Flemish]] and [[Walloon]]. Together, they constitute a little over 85%. There are many other European populations who constitute a large and growing fraction like [[Italy|Italian]], [[France|French]], and [[Germany|German]] (majorities) who number 11.1%. Arab immigrants, mostly from [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]], and [[Turkey|Turkish]] immigrants number over 3% of the total population.

98% of the adult population is [[literate]].{{ref|ethnologue}} Education is compulsory from the ages of six to 18, but many Belgians continue to study until the age of about 23. Among the [[OECD]] countries in 1999, Belgium had the third highest proportion of 18–21-year-olds enrolled in [[postsecondary education]], at 42%.{{ref|edu}} Nevertheless, in recent years, concern is rising over certain forms of [[illiteracy]], such as [[functional illiteracy]]. In the period 1994–98, 18.4% of the population lacks functional literacy skills.{{ref|undp}}  Mirroring the historical political conflicts between the freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Belgian educational system in each communities is split into a ''[[laicite|laïque]]'' branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a [[subsidy|subsidised]] religious—mostly Catholic—branch controlled by both the communities and the religious authorities—usually the [[diocese]]s. It should however be noted that - at least for the Catholic schools - the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools.

{{main|Culture of Belgium}}
Belgian cultural life has tended to concentrate within each community. The shared element is less important, because there are no bilingual universities, except the royal military academy, no common media, and no single, common large cultural or scientific organisation where both main communities are represented. Aside from these differences, Belgium is well-known for its fine art and architecture.

The region corresponding to today's Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence over European art.  The [[Mosan art]], the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]], the Flemish [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] painting, and major examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture]], and the Renaissance [[vocal music]] of the [[Dutch School (music)|Dutch School]] developed in the southern part of the Low Countries, are milestones in the history of art.  

[[دوتنه:Entry_in.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Entry of Christ into Brussels, [[James Ensor]], 1888, [[Malibu]]. This painting is inspired by the many folk festivals in Belgium.]]
This rich artistic production, often referred to as a whole as [[Flemish art]], gradually declined during the second half of the 17th century.  However, in the 19th and 20th centuries, many original artists appeared. In music, [[Adolphe Sax]] invented the [[saxophone]] in 1846. [[Eugène Ysaÿe]] was a major 19th- and 20th-century Belgian violinist (See also [[Music of Belgium]]). In architecture, [[Victor Horta]] was a major initiator of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Belgium has produced famous [[romanticism|romantic]], [[expressionism|expressionist]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] painters; these include [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Egide Wappers]], [[James Ensor]], [[Constant Permeke]] and [[René Magritte]]. In literature, Belgium has produced several well-known authors, such as the poets [[Emile Verhaeren]], [[Jacques Brel]] and novelists [[Hendrik Conscience]] and [[Georges Simenon]]. The poet and playwright [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] in 1911. The best known [[Franco-Belgian comics]] are ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' by [[Hergé]] but many other major authors of comics have been Belgian, including [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] and [[André Franquin]]. 

More recently, notable cinema directors have emerged, most of them strongly influenced by [[French cinema]]. The absence of a major Belgian cinema company has forced them to emigrate or participate in low-budget productions. Belgian directors include [[Stijn Coninx]],  [[Luc Dardenne|Luc]] and [[Jean-Pierre Dardenne]]; actors include [[Jan Decleir]], [[Marie Gillain]]; and films include ''[[Man Bites Dog]]'' and ''[[The Alzheimer Affair]]''. In the 1980s, Antwerp's [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] has produced the important fashion trendsetters, the [[Antwerp Six]].

Belgium has also contributed to the development of science and technology.  The [[mathematics|mathematician]]  [[Simon Stevin]], the [[anatomy|anatomist]] [[Andreas Vesalius]] and the [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Gerardus Mercator]] are among the most influential scientists from the beginning of [[Early Modern]] in the Low Countries.  More recently, at the end of the 19th century, in [[applied science]], the [[chemist]] [[Ernest Solvay]] and the [[engineering|engineer]] [[Zenobe Gramme]] have given their names to the [[Solvay process]] and the [[Gramme dynamo]]. [[Georges Lemaître]] is a famous Belgian [[cosmology|cosmologist]] credited with proposing the [[Big Bang]] theory of the origin of the universe in 1927. Three [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine]] have been awarded to Belgians: [[Jules Bordet]] in 1919, [[Corneille Heymans]] in 1938, and [[Albert Claude]] and [[Christian De Duve]] in 1974.  [[Ilya Prigogine]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1977. 

On [[December 1]], [[2005]], [[Father Damien]] was chosen as the Greatest Belgian of all time by the Flemish [[VRT]], whereas the [[Walloons]] chose [[Jacques Brel]].

One could not understand Belgian cultural life without considering the folk festivals, which play a major role in the country's cultural life.  Examples are the Carnival of [[Binche]], the Ducasse of [[Ath]], the procession of the Holy Blood in Bruges, the 15th-of-August festival in Liège, and the Walloon festival in Namur. A major non-official holiday is the [[Saint Nicholas Day]], which commemorates the festival of the children and, in Liège, of the students.

Belgium is well represented in the world of sport—[[football (soccer)]] and [[cycling]] are especially popular. The [[Belgium national football team|national football team]] is the [[Red Devils]]. Among the well known cyclists, [[Eddy Merckx]], won five [[Tour de France|Tours de France]]. Belgium also has two current female tennis champions: [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Justine Henin-Hardenne]].

Many highly ranked restaurants can be found in the high-impact gastronomic guides, such as the [[Michelin Guide]]. Brands of Belgian chocolate, like [[Chocolatier Neuhaus|Neuhaus]], are world renowned and widely sold; even the cheapest and most popular brand, [[Leonidas (chocolate maker)|Leonidas]], has earned a reputation for its quality. Belgium produces over 500 varieties of beer ([[ale]]s, [[pils]]) (see [[Belgian beer]]). Belgians have a reputation for loving [[Belgian waffle|waffles]] and [[French fries]] aka Belgian chips, both originally from Belgium; the national food is steak (or mussels) with French fries.
