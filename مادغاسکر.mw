'''Madagascar''', officially the '''Republic of Madagascar''', is an [[island nation]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the eastern coast of [[Africa]].  The main island, also called Madagascar, is the [[List of islands by size|fourth largest island in the world]]. It is the home of five percent of the world's [[plant]] and [[animal]] [[species]], 80 percent of which are unique to Madagascar. Among its most notable examples of [[biodiversity]] are the [[lemur]] infraorder of [[primate]]s, three [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] bird [[family (biology)|families]] and six endemic [[baobab|baobab species]]. The adjective (language, ethnicity and citizenship) derived from Madagascar is ''Malagasy'' (pronounced "mal-la-gash").  The primary language spoken in Madagascar is [[Malagasy]].

== تاريخ ==
{{main|History of Madagascar}}

Archeologists place the first arrival of humans on the island to the years between 200 and 500 C.E., when seafarers from southeast Asia, probably [[Kalimantan]] or the southern [[Sulawesi]], arrived after crossing thousands of miles of open ocean in their outrigger canoes.  The feat represented the western-most branch of the great [[Austronesian]] expansion. 

The written history of Madagascar began in the 7th century, when [[Arab]]s established trading posts along the northwest coast. European contact began in the 1500s, when [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sea captain [[Diego Dias]] sighted the island after his ship became separated from a fleet going to [[India]]. In the late 17th century, the [[France|French]] established trading posts along the east coast. From about 1774 to 1824, it was a favourite haunt for [[pirate]]s, including [[United States|Americans]], one of whom brought [[Malagasy rice]] to [[South Carolina]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], the chiefs of the different settlements on the island began to extend their power through trade with Madagascar's Indian Ocean neighbors, notably North Africa, the Middle-east and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island.  Among these were the [[Sakalava]] chiefdoms of the [[Menabe]], centered in what is now the town of [[Morondava]], and of [[Boina]], centered in what is now the provincial capital of [[Mahajanga]] ([[Majunga]]).  The influence of the [[Sakalava]] extended across what is now the provinces of [[Antsiranana]], [[Mahajanga]] and [[Toliara]].  But with the domination of the Indian Ocean by the British fleet and the end of the [[Arab slave trade]], the [[Sakalava]] would lose their power to the emerging [[Merina]] threat. For a short time the Betsimisaraka of the east coast also unified, but this unification was short-lived. 

Beginning in the 1790s, [[Merina]] rulers succeeded in establishing [[hegemony]] over the major part of the island, including the coast. In 1817, the Merina ruler and the [[United Kingdom|British]] governor of [[Mauritius]] concluded a [[treaty]] abolishing the [[slave trade]], which had been important in Madagascar's economy. In return, the island received British military and financial assistance. British influence remained strong for several decades, during which the Merina court was converted to [[Presbyterianism]], [[Congregationalism]], and [[Anglicanism]].

France invaded Madagascar in [[1883]] in what became known as the first [[Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' being the name of the Merina aristocrats), eeking to restore property that had been confiscated from French citizens. At the war’s end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert. The British accepted the imposition of a French [[protectorate]] over Madagascar in 1885 in return for eventual control over [[Zanzibar]] (now part of [[Tanzania]]) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area.

In Europe, meanwhile, diplomats partitioning the Africa continent worked out an agreement whereby Britain, to obtain the Sultanate of [[Zanzibar]], ceded its share of [[Heligoland]] to [[Germany]] and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement spelled doom for Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing England and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from England. In [[1895]], a French flying column landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], where the city’s defenders were taken by surprise, as they were expecting an attack from the much closer east coast. Twenty French soldiers died fighting and 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the second Franco-Hova War ended. 

Absolute French control over Madagascar was established by military force in 1895-1896,  and in 1896, the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] Madagascar. The 103-year-old Merina monarchy ended with the royal family being sent into exile in [[Algeria]]. In December 1904, the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] stopped at [[Diego Suarez]] for coal and provisions before sailing on to its doomed encounter with the Japanese Fleet in the [[Battle of Tsushima]].  Before leaving port the Russian sailors were required to put ashore the animals they had acquired, including [[monkey]]s, [[Red-tailed Boa|boa constrictors]] and one [[crocodile]].  

[[دوتنه:Karte Madagaskar MKL1888.png|thumb|left|An 1888 map of Madagascar]]
During [[World War II]], Malagasy troops fought in [[France]], [[Morocco]], and [[Syria]].  Immediately preceding the fall of France, [[Germany]] initiated planning to forcibly deport all of Europe's [[Jews]] to Madagascar in what was known as the [[Madagascar Plan]].  Action on the plan was never begun.  After France fell to Germany, the [[Vichy]] government administered Madagascar. British troops occupied the strategic island in 1942 to preclude its seizure by the [[Japan]]ese. The [[Free French]] received the island from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1943.

In 1947, with French prestige at low ebb, a [[Madagascar revolt|nationalist uprising]] was suppressed after several months of bitter fighting with 100,000 persons killed and this after Malagasy troops had to fight for France during World War II. The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre ([[Overseas Reform Act]]), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on [[October 14]], [[1958]], as an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a [[constitution]] in 1959 and full [[independence]] on [[June 26]], [[1960]].

{{morepolitics|country=Madagascar}}
Madagascar's first President, [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was elected when his [[Social Democratic Party (Madagascar)|Social Democratic Party]] gained power at independence in 1960 and was reelected without opposition in March 1972. However, he resigned only 2 months later in response to massive [[antigovernment demonstration]]s. The unrest continued, and Tsiranana's successor, Gen. [[Gabriel Ramanantsoa]], resigned on [[February 5]], [[1975]], handing over executive power to Lt. Col. [[Richard Ratsimandrava]], who was assassinated 6 days later. A provisional military directorate then ruled until a new government was formed in June 1975, under [[Didier Ratsiraka]].

During the 16 subsequent years of President Ratsiraka's rule, Madagascar continued under a government committed to revolutionary [[socialism]] based on the 1975 Constitution establishing a highly [[Centralization|centralized]] state. During this period a strategy of [[nationalization]] of private enterprises, centralization of the economy and "Malgasization" of the education system crippled the economy, leaving traces even today of a highly centralized economic system and a high level of [[illiteracy]].  National elections in 1982 and 1989 returned Ratsiraka for a second and third 7-year presidential term. For much of this period, only limited and restrained political opposition was tolerated, with no direct criticism of the president permitted in the press.

With an easing of restrictions on political expression, beginning in the late 1980s, the Ratsiraka regime came under increasing pressure to make fundamental changes. In response to a deteriorating economy, Ratsiraka relaxed socialist economic policies and instituted some [[classical liberalism|liberal]], private-sector reforms. These, along with political reforms like the elimination of [[press censorship]] in 1989 and the formation of more political parties in 1990, were insufficient to placate a growing opposition movement known as [[Hery Velona]] ("Active Forces"). A number of already existing political parties and their leaders, among them [[Albert Zafy]] and [[Rakotoniaina Manandafy]], anchored this movement which was especially strong in [[Antananarivo]] and the surrounding high plateau.

In response to largely peaceful mass demonstrations and crippling general strikes, Ratsiraka replaced his prime minister in August 1991 but suffered an irreparable setback soon thereafter when his troops fired on peaceful demonstrators marching on [[Iavoloha]], the suburban presidential palace, killing more than 30.

In an increasingly weakened position, Ratsiraka acceded to negotiations on the formation of a [[transitional government]]. The resulting "[[Panorama Convention]]" of [[October 31]], [[1991]], stripped Ratsiraka of nearly all of his powers, created interim institutions, and set an 18-month timetable for completing a transition to a new form of constitutional government. The [[Constitutional Court|High Constitutional Court]] was retained as the ultimate judicial arbiter of the process.

In March 1992, a widely representative [[National Forum]] organized by the [[FFKM]] (Malagasy Christian Council of Churches) drafted a new Constitution. Troops guarding the proceedings clashed with pro-Ratsiraka "[[federalist]]s" who tried to disrupt the forum in protest of draft constitutional provisions preventing the incumbent president from running again. The text of the new Constitution was put to a nationwide referendum in August 1992 and approved by a wide margin, despite efforts by federalists to disrupt [[ballot]]ing in several coastal areas.

[[Presidential election]]s were held on [[November 25]], [[1992]], after the High Constitutional Court had ruled, over Hery Velona objections, that Ratsiraka could become a candidate. Runoff elections were held in February 1993, and the leader of the Hery Velona movement, Albert Zafy, defeated Ratsiraka. Zafy was sworn in as President on [[March 27]], [[1993]]. After President Zafy's impeachment by the National Assembly in 1996 and the short quasi-presidency of [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], the 1997 elections once again pitted Zafy and Ratsiraka, with Ratsiraka this time emerging victorious. A National Assembly dominated by members of President Ratsiraka'a political party [[AREMA]] subsequently passed the 1998 Constitution, which considerably strengthened the presidency.

In December 2001, a presidential election was held in which both major candidates claimed victory. The Ministry of the Interior declared incumbent Ratsiraka of the AREMA party victorious. [[Marc Ravalomanana]] contested the results and claimed victory. A political crisis followed in which Ratsiraka supporters cut major transport routes from the primary port city to the capital city, a stronghold of Ravalomanana support. Sporadic violence and considerable economic disruption continued until July 2002 when Ratsiraka and several of his prominent supporters fled to [[exile]] in [[France]]. In addition to political differences, ethnic differences played a role in the crisis and continue to play a role in politics. Ratsiraka is from the coastal [[Betsimisaraka]] tribe and Ravalomanana comes from the highland [[Merina]] tribe.

After the end of the 2002 political crisis, President Ravalomanana began many reform projects, forcefully advocating "rapid and durable development" and the launching of a battle against corruption. December 2002 legislative elections gave his newly formed [[TIM (Tiako-I-Madagasikara)]] (I Love Madagascar) Party a commanding majority in the National Assembly. November 2003 municipal elections were conducted freely, returning a majority of supporters of the president, but also significant numbers of independent and regional opposition figures.

Following the crisis of 2002, the President replaced provincial governors with appointed PDSs ([[Presidents des Delegations Speciales]]). Subsequent legislation established a structure of 22 regions to decentralize administration. In September 2004, the Government named 22 Regional Chiefs, reporting directly to the President, to implement its decentralization plans. Financing and specific powers for the regional administrations remain to be clarified.

In March 1998, Malagasy voters approved a revised constitution. The principal institutions of the Republic of Madagascar are a [[president|presidency]], a [[parliament]] ([[National Assembly]] and [[Senate]]), a prime ministry and cabinet, and an independent [[judiciary]]. The president is elected by direct [[universal suffrage]] for a 5-year term, renewable twice.

The National Assembly consists of 160 representatives elected by direct [[vote]] every 5 years. The last election was held in December 2002. The Senate consists of 90 senators, two-thirds elected by local legislators and other Grand Electors and one-third appointed by the president, all for 6-year terms. A prime minister and council of ministers carries out day-to-day management of government. The president appoints the [[prime minister]].

The prime minister and members of Parliament initiate [[legislation]], and the government executes it. The president can dissolve the National Assembly. For its part, the National Assembly can pass a motion of [[censure]] and require the prime minister and council of ministers to step down. The Constitutional Court approves the constitutionality of new laws. Madagascar is also part of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]].

During the second republic (1975-1991), Madagascar was divided into five levels of government:
# [[Faritany]] (province)
# [[Fivondronana]] (or fivondronampokontany)
# [[Firaisana]] (or firaisampokontany)
# [[Fokontany]]
# [[Fokonolona]]
<td valign=top>
Today, there are four levels of division:
# [[Faritany mizakatena]] ([[autonomous]] [[province]])
# [[Faritra]] ([[region]])
# [[Departemanta]] ([[department]])
# [[Kaominina]] ([[commune (subnational entity)|commune]])
</table>
The constitution of 1992 ruled that the country should be decentralized into territorial entities. The name, number, and limits of territorial entities should be determined by law. The law passed by the national assembly in 1994 defined three such entity levels: [[region]] ([[faritra]]), [[department]] ([[departemanta]]) and [[commune (subnational entity)|commune]] ([[kaominina]]). The communes were created in 1996.

With [[Didier Ratsiraka]] back in power, the constitution was changed in 1998, to include and specifically mention six autonomous provinces, divided into undefined regions and communes. The autonomous provinces, having the same names and territories as the already existing provinces, were created in 2000.

During the power struggle after the presidential elections in 2001, five of those provinces, whose governors supported Ratsiraka, declared themselves independent from the republic. The new president, Ravalomanana, replaced the provincial governments by special delegations, appointed by the president. This effectively means that the autonomous provinces have ceased to exist as such, although it remains unclear whether they will remain in place.

In 2004, the regions were finally created by the national assembly in law no. 2004-001. Meanwhile the 28 regions originally proposed had become 22. Although they are subdivisions of the provinces, they are representatives (and representing the people) of the republic, not the province. The regions will also take over the assets of the "ex-Fivondronampokontany". It is also mentioned that the communes are the only entities that are operational, and there will be an unspecified period of transition to the new system. The departments are not mentioned in the law, instead the designation "components" of the regions is used. It appears that the departments will be based on the ''Fivondronampokontany'', although it is unclear whether they are already in place and what it means that the assets will be taken over by the regions.

{{main|Geography of Madagascar}}
{{MapLibrary|Madagascar_sat.png|Madagascar}}

The east coast of Madagascar has lowlands leading to steep bluffs and central highlands. The [[Tsaratanana Massif]] in the north has [[volcanic]] mountains. The west coast has many protected harbors and broad [[plain]]s, while the southwest is a [[plateau]] and [[desert]] region.

There are two seasons: it is hot and rainy from November to April, and cooler and dry from May to October. Southeastern [[trade wind]]s dominate, and there are occasional [[cyclone]]s.

== Ecology ==
{{main|Ecoregions of Madagascar}}

Madagascar's long isolation from the neighboring continents has resulted in a unique mix of plants and animals, many found nowhere else in the world; some ecologists refer to Madagascar as the "eighth continent".

The eastern, or windward side of the island is home to [[tropical rainforest]]s, while the western and southern sides of the island, which lie in the [[rain shadow]] of the central highlands, are home to [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|tropical dry forests]], thorn forests, and [[deserts and xeric shrublands]].  Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been preserved generally better than the eastern rainforests or the high central [[plateau]], presumably due to historically less population density and scarcity of water.  There has been some [[slash-and-burn]] activity in the eastern and western dry forests as well as the central high plateau, reducing certain forest [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and applying pressure to some [[endangered species]].  Slash-and-burn is a method sometimes used by [[shifting cultivation|shifting cultivators]] to create short term yields from marginal soils. When practiced repeatedly, or without intervening fallow periods, the [[nutrient]] poor soils may be exhausted or eroded to an unproductive state.  The resulting increased [[surface runoff]] from burned lands has caused significant erosion and resulting high sedimentation to western rivers.

{{main|Economy of Madagascar}}

[[Structural reform]]s began in the late 1980s, initially under pressure from international financial institutions, notably the [[World Bank]]. An initial privatization program (1988-1993) and the development of an [[export processing zone]] (EPZ) regime in the early 1990s were key milestones in this effort. A period of significant stagnation from 1991-96 was followed by 5 years of solid economic growth and accelerating foreign investment, driven by a second wave of privatizations and EPZ development. Although structural reforms advanced, governance remained weak and perceived [[political corruption|corruption]] in Madagascar was extremely high. During the period of solid growth from 1997 through 2001, [[poverty]] levels remained stubbornly high, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a dispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001 virtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of 2002. [[Real GDP]] dropped 12.7% for the year 2002, inflows of [[foreign investment]] dropped sharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar's budding reputation as an [[AGOA]] standout and a promising place to invest. Following resolution of the crisis, the economy rebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003. [[Currency depreciation]] and rising [[inflation]] in 2004 have hampered economic performance, but growth for the year reached 5.3 percent, with inflation reaching around 25% at the end of the year.  In 2005 inflation was brought under control by tight monetary policy (the "Taux Directeur", or central bank rate, was raised to 16% and reserve requirements for banks tightened), and growth will reach around 6.5% in 2005.

Following the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new course and build confidence, in coordination with [[international financial institution]]s and the donor community. Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration with the private sector and donors and presented it at a "Friends of Madagascar" conference organized by the [[World Bank]] in [[Paris]] in July 2002. Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The Malagasy Government identified [[road infrastructure]] as its principle priority and underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a joint public-private sector steering committee.

In 2000, Madagascar embarked on the preparation of a [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper]] (PRSP) under the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) Initiative. The boards of the [[IMF]] and World Bank agreed in December 2000 that the country had reached the decision point for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and defined a set of conditions for Madagascar to reach the completion point. In October 2004, the boards of the IMF and the [[World Bank]] determined that Madagascar had reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The [[Madagascar-U.S. Business Council]] was formed in Madagascar in 2002. The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council was formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organizations continue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.

The government of President Ravalomanana is aggressively seeking foreign investment and is tackling many of the obstacles to such investment, including combating corruption, reforming land-ownership laws, encouraging study of American and European business techniques, and active pursuit of foreign investors. President Ravalomanana rose to prominence through his agro-foods [[TIKO]] company, and is known for attempting to apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the government.  Some recent concerns have arisen about the confict of interest between the policies pursued by President and the activities his firms, most notably with preferential treatment for rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 responding to a production shortfall in the country.

Madagascar's sources of growth are tourism; textile and light manufacturing exports (notably through the EPZs); agricultural products (the country is the world's leading producer of [[vanilla]], accounting for about half the world's export market); and mining.  Tourism targets the niche eco-tourism market, capitalizing on Madagascar's unique biodiversity, unspoiled natural habitats, and lemur species. Exports from the EPZs, located around Antananarivo and Antsirabe, consist the most part of garment manufacture, targeting the US market under [[AGOA]] and the European markets under the [[Everything But Arms]] (EBA) agreement.  Agricultural exports consist of low volume high value products like vanilla, litchies and essential oils.  Mining investment is beginning to take off following the introduction of a new law opening the country up to foreign mining companies.  A large mining investment by Rio Tinto in the Fort Dauphin region, to exploit ilmenite (titanium dioxide), is expected by late 2005, and other projects in ilmenite (Ticor/Kumba in Tulear) and nickel (Dynatec/Implats near Tamatave) could also be launched in the coming months.

Madagascar, which has historically been perceived as on the margin of mainstream African affairs, eagerly rejoined the [[African Union]] in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus triggered by the 2002 political crisis. From 1978 until 1991, then-President Ratsiraka emphasized independence and nonalignment and followed an "all points" policy stressing ties with socialist and radical regimes, including [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Iran]]. Taking office in 1993, President [[Albert Zafy]] expressed his desire for diplomatic relations with all countries. Early in his tenure, he established formal ties with [[South Korea]] and sent emissaries to [[Morocco]].

Starting in 1997, [[globalization]] encouraged the government and President Ratsiraka to adhere to market-oriented policies and to engage world markets. External relations reflect this trend, although Madagascar's physical isolation and strong traditional insular orientation have limited its activity in regional economic organizations and relations with its [[East Africa]]n neighbors. It enjoys closer and generally good relations with its [[Indian Ocean]] neighbors -- [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]], and [[Comoros]]. Active relationships with [[Europe]], especially [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Switzerland]], as well as with [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[India]], and [[China]] have been strong since independence.  More recently, President Ravalomanana has cultivated strong links with the United States, and Madagascar was the first country to benefit from the [[Millennium Challenge Account|Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)]]. Madagascar is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).


President Ravalomanana has stated that he welcomes relations with all countries interested in helping Madagascar to develop. He has consciously sought to strengthen relations with [[Anglophone]] countries as a means of balancing traditionally strong French influence.

Madagascar's population is predominantly of mixed [[Asian]] and [[Africa]]n origin, though those who are visibly Asian in appearance and culture are the minority, found in the highland regions. Recent research suggests that the island was uninhabited until [[Malay people|Malay]] seafarers arrived between about 2,000 to 1,500 years ago. Recent [[DNA]] research shows that the Malagasy are approximately of half Malay and half East African stock, although some [[Arab]], [[India]]n and [[European]] influence is present along the coast. The Malagasy language shares some 90% of its basic vocabulary with the [[Maanyan]] language from the region of the Barito River in southern [[Borneo]]. 

Subsequent [[human migration|migrations]] from both the Pacific and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and 36 separate tribal groups emerged. Asian features are most predominant in the [[Merina]] (3 million) ; the coastal people (called ''côtiers'') are of more clearly African origin.

The largest coastal groups are the [[Betsimisaraka]] (1.5 million) and the [[Tsimihety]] and [[Sakalava]] (700,000 each).

The [[Malagasy language]] is of [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. [[French language|French]] is spoken among the educated population of this former French colony. [[English language|English]] is becoming more widely spoken and in 2003 the government began a pilot project of introducing the teaching of English into the [[primary grade]]s of 44 schools, with hopes of taking the project nationwide. Many [[Peace Corps]] volunteers are serving to further this effort and train teachers. 

In the first Constitution of Madagascar (1960), Malagasy and French were named the "official languages of the republic". In the current Constitution, there is no official language mentioned, instead Malagasy is named the "national language". In a case where a citizen had claimed unconstitutional the publication of official documents in the French language only, The High Constitutional Court has observed in its decision<ref>Haute Cour Constitutionnelle De Madagascar, Décision n°03-HCC/D2 Du 12 avril 2000 [http://www.simicro.mg/hcc/hcc/D20300.html]</ref> that, in the absence of a language law, French still has the character of an official language.

=== مذهب ===
Approximately half of the country's population practices traditional religions, which tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. The Merina in the highlands particularly tend to hold tightly to this practice. They believe that the dead join their [[ancestor]]s in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. The Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of [[famadihana]], or "turning over the dead" celebrate this spiritual communion. In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor.

About 45% of the Malagasy are [[Christianity|Christian]], divided almost evenly between [[Roman Catholicism in Madagascar|Catholics]] and [[Protestant]]s. Many incorporate the [[cult of the dead]] with their religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may invite a pastor to attend a famadihana. The [[Roman Catholic church]] is open to its members continuing these practices, while more conservative protestant denominations tend to condemn them to be [[superstition]]s or demon worship that should be abandoned. Many of the Christian churches are influential in politics. The best example of this is the Malagasy Council of Churches (FFKM) comprised of the four oldest and most prominent christian denominations ([[Roman Catholic]], [[Reformed Protestant]], [[Lutheran]] and [[Anglican]]). In the coastal regions of the provinces of [[Mahajanga]] and [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez), [[Muslim]]s constitute a significant minority. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, [[Indo-Pakistani]]s, and [[Comorians]].

* The Malagasy economy took a brief downturn during the 1980s when [[Coca-Cola]], the world's leading purchaser of vanilla, switched to the [[New Coke]] formula that contained synthetic [[vanillin]].  The situation reversed itself when the company reintroduced its classic formula.

* According to the latest census data, the majority of Malagasy citizens (about 52%) practice indigenous religious beliefs rather than [[Major world religions|world religions]].
