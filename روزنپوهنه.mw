'''Pedagogy''' ({{pron-en|ˈpɛdəɡɒdʒi}} or {{IPA-en|ˈpɛdəɡoʊdʒi|}}<ref>http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?dict=CALD&key=58389&ph=on</ref><ref>http://www.bartleby.com/61/34/P0143400.html</ref>) is the study of being a [[teacher]]. The term generally refers to strategies of instruction, or a style of instruction.<ref>[from NSF]</ref> 
'''روزنپوهنه''' 
Pedagogy is also occasionally referred to as the correct use of instructive strategies (see [[instructional theory]]).  For example, [[Paulo Freire]] referred to his method of teaching adult humans as "[[critical pedagogy]]". In correlation with those instructive strategies the instructor's own philosophical beliefs of instruction are harbored and governed by the pupil's back-ground knowledge and experience,  situation, and environment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the [[Socratic method|Socratic schools of thought]].<ref>[http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/users/ilwebb/Research/pedagogy.htm Analysis of Pedagogy]</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{wiktionary}}
The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|παιδαγωγέω}} (paidagōgeō); in which {{polytonic|παῖς (''país'', genitive παιδός, ''paidos'')}} means "child" and {{polytonic|άγω}} (''ágō'') means "lead"; so it literally means "to lead the child". In Ancient Greece, {{Polytonic|παιδαγωγός}} was (usually) a slave who supervised the instruction of his master’s son (girls were not publicly taught). This involved taking him to school ({{Polytonic|διδασκαλεῖον}}) or a gym ({{Polytonic|γυμναστήριον}}), looking after him and carrying his equipment (e.g. music instruments).<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pedagogue Etymology Site on-line (pedagogue)]</ref> 

The Latin-derived word for pedagogy: child-instruction, is in modern use in English to refer to the whole context of instruction, learning, and the actual operation involved therein, although both words have roughly the same original meaning. In English the term pedagogy is used to refer to 
instructive theory; trainee teachers learn their subject and also the pedagogy appropriate for teaching that subject.<ref>[http://www.webster-Victionary.org/definition/pedagogy Webster's definition of Pedagogy]</ref> The introduction of information technology into schools has necessitated changes in pedagogy; teachers are adopting new methods of teaching facilitated by the new technology. 
The late [[Malcolm Knowles]] reasoned that the term ''[[andragogy]]'' is more pertinent when discussing adult learning and teaching.  He referred to andragogy as the art and science of teaching adults.

==Academic degree==
An [[academic degree]], Ped. D., [[Doctorate|Doctor]] of Pedagogy, is awarded honorarily by some U.S. universities to distinguished teachers (in the U.S. and U.K. earned degrees within the instructive field are classified as an Ed. D., [[Doctor of Education]] or a Ph.D. [[Doctor of Philosophy]]). The term is also used to denote an emphasis in education as a specialty in a field (for instance, a [[Doctor of Music]] degree in [[piano pedagogy]]).
