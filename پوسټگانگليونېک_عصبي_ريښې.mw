In the [[autonomic nervous system]], fibers from the [[ganglion]] to the effector organ are called '''postganglionic fibers'''.

The neurotransmitters used for postganglionic fibers differ:

* In the [[parasympathetic division]], they are ''[[cholinergic]]'' (that is, they use [[acetylcholine]] as their [[neurotransmitter]]s.)

* In the [[sympathetic division]], most are ''[[adrenergic]]'' (that is, they use [[norepinephrine]] as their neurotransmitters.)  One exception of this is the sympathetic innervation of [[sweat gland]]s, which uses [[acetylcholine]] as a neurotransmitter at both pre and post ganglionic synapses.
