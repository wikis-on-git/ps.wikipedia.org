اردو ژبه د هند و آریایي ژبو له ډلې نه ده چې په پراخه کچه په جنوبي اسیا کې پرې تکلم  کېږي. دا ژبه د پاکستان ملي ژبه او منځګړې ژبه ده. په هند کې، اردو د قانون تر ملاتړ لاندې اتمه ژبه ده، چې حیثیت، فعالیت او کلتوري میراث یې د هند د اساسي قانون له لوري په رسمیت پېژندل شوی او هم د هند په څو ایالتونو کې رسمي ژبه ده. په نیپال کې، اردو یوه رسمي سیمه يیزه لهجه ګڼل کېږي.  <ref name=":0">[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/urdu "Urdu"]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319020509/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/urdu|date=19 March 2016}}.

Its first major folk poet was the great Persian master, Amir Khusrau (1253–1325), who is known to have composed dohas (couplets) and riddles in the newly-formed speech, then called 'Hindavi'. Through the medieval time, this mixed speech was variously called by various speech sub-groups as 'Hindavi', 'Zaban-e-Hind', 'Hindi', 'Zaban-e-Dehli', 'Rekhta', 'Gujarii. 'Dakkhani', 'Zaban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla', 'Zaban-e-Urdu', or just 'Urdu'. By the late 11th century, the name 'Hindustani' was in vogue and had become the lingua franca for most of northern India. A sub-dialect called Khari Boli was spoken in and around the Delhi region at the start of the 13th century when the Delhi Sultanate was established. Khari Boli gradually became the prestige dialect of Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) and became the basis of modern Standard Hindi & Urdu.}}</ref><ref>Schmidt, Ruth Laila.

Conversational registers of Hindi/Urdu (not to mentioned formal registers of Urdu) employ large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords, although in Sanskritised registers many of these words are replaced by ''tatsama'' forms from Sanskrit. The Persian and Arabic lexical elements in Hindi result from the effects of centuries of Islamic administrative rule over much of north India in the centuries before the establishment of British rule in India. Although it is conventional to differentiate among Persian and Arabic loan elements into Hindi/Urdu, in practice it is often difficult to separate these strands from one another. The Arabic (and also Turkic) lexemes borrowed into Hindi frequently were mediated through Persian, as a result of which a thorough intertwining of Persian and Arabic elements took place, as manifest by such phenomena as hybrid compounds and compound words. Moreover, although the dominant trajectory of lexical borrowing was from Arabic into Persian, and thence into Hindi/Urdu, examples can be found of words that in origin are actually Persian loanwords into both Arabic and Hindi/Urdu.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=English-Urdu Learner's Dictionary|date=6 March 2021|publisher=Multi Linguis|isbn=978-1-005-94089-8|language=English|quote=** History (Simplified) ** Proto-Indo European > Proto-Indo-Iranian > Proto-Indo-Aryan > Vedic Sanskrit > Classical Sanskrit > Sauraseni Prakrit > Sauraseni Apabhramsa > Old Hindi > Hindustani > Urdu}}</ref><ref name="Kesavan1997">{{cite book|last1=Kesavan|first1=B.

Amrit Rai offers evidence to show that although the employment of Perso-Arabic script for the language which was akin to Hindi/Hindavi or old Hindi was the first step towards the establishment of the separate identity of Urdu, it was called Hindi for a long time. "The final and complete change-over to the new name took place after the content of the language had undergone a drastic change." He further observes: "In the light of the literature that has come down to us, for about six hundred years, the development of Hindi/Hindavi seems largely to substantiate the view of the basic unity of the two languages. Then, sometime in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, the cleavage seems to have begun." Rai quotes from Sadiq, who points out how it became a "systematic policy of poets and scholars" of the eighteenth century to weed out, what they called and thought, "vulgar words." This weeding out meant "the elimination, along with some rough and unmusical plebian words, of a large number of Hindi words for the reason that to the people brought up in Persian traditions they appeared unfamiliar and vulgar." Sadiq concludes: hence the paradox that this crusade against Persian tyranny, instead of bringing Urdu close to the indigenous element, meant in reality a wider gulf between it and the popular speech. But what differentiated Urdu still more from the local dialects was a process of ceaseless importation from Persian. It may seem strange that Urdu writers in rebellion against Persian should decide to draw heavily on Persian vocabulary, idioms, forms, and sentiments. . . . Around 1875 in his word ''Urdu Sarf O Nahr'', however, he presented a balanced view pointing out that attempts of the Maulavis to Persianize and of the Pandits to Sanskritize the language were not only an error but against the natural laws of linguistic growth. The common man, he pointed out, used both Persian and Sanskrit words without any qualms;}}</ref><ref name="Taj2">{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~taj/abturdu.htm|title=About Hindi-Urdu|last1=Taj|first1=Afroz|date=1997|publisher=[[The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815023328/http://sasw.chass.ncsu.edu/fl/faculty/taj/hindi/abturdu.htm|archive-date=15 August 2009|access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hindiurduflagship.org/about/two-languages-or-one/|title=Two Languages or One?|work=hindiurduflagship.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311230741/http://hindiurduflagship.org/about/two-languages-or-one/|archive-date=11 March 2015|access-date=29 March 2015|quote=Hindi and Urdu developed from the "khari boli" dialect spoken in the Delhi region of northern India.}}</ref>

د هندي ژبې زړې هندي د ډیلي په څېر ښارونو کې، له پارسي څخه د لغاتو پور پیل کړ او د "هندي" او وروسته بیا "هندوستاني" په نوم یاده شوه. په سویلي هند کې (په ځانګړې توګه په ګولکونډا او بیجاپور کې)، د منځنیو پېړیو په هند کې د دکني ژبې په نوم د ژبې یوې بڼې وده وکړه، چې له تلوګو او مراهټي څخه یې پور کلیمات درلودل. د هنداوی یو لومړنی ادبي دود، د دیارلسمې پېړۍ په وروستیو کې د امیر خسرو له لوري را منځته شو. <ref name="Kesavan19972">{{cite book|last1=Kesavan|first1=B.

That means that Hindi and Urdu speakers who shop in the same markets (and watch the same Bollywood films) have no problems understanding each other -- they'd both say yeh ''kitne'' kaa hay for 'How much is it?' -- but the written form for Hindi will be यह कितने का है? and the Urdu one will be یہ کتنے کا ہے؟ Hindi is written from left to right in the Devanagari script, and is the official language of India, along with English. Urdu, on the other hand, is written from right to left in the Nastaliq script (a modified form of the Arabic script) and is the national language of Pakistan. It's also one of the official languages of the Indian states of Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir. Considered as one, these tongues constitute the second most spoken language in the world, sometimes called Hindustani. In their daily lives, Hindi and Urdu speakers communicate in their 'different' languages without major problems. ... Both Hindi and Urdu developed from Classical Sanskrit, which appeared in the Indus Valley (modern Pakistan and northwest India) at about the start of the Common Era. The first old Hindi (or Apabhransha) poetry was written in the year 769 AD, and by the European Middle Ages it became known as 'Hindvi'. Muslim Turks invaded the Punjab in 1027 and took control of Delhi in 1193. They paved the way for the Islamic Mughal Empire, which ruled northern India from the 16th century until it was defeated by the British Raj in the mid-19th century. It was at this time that the language of this book began to take form, a mixture of Hindvi grammar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish vocabulary. The Muslim speakers of Hindvi began to write in the Arabic script, creating Urdu, while the Hindu population incorporated the new words but continued to write in Devanagari script.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Islam|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-521-29138-0|editor-last=Holt|editor-first=P.

د لومړي ځل لپاره اردو ته د ریخته کلیمه د اکبر پاچا په دوره کې وکارول شوه. دا په اصل کې پارسي کلیمه وه چې د " مخلوط جوړولو" په معنا وه. خسرو لومړنی کس و چې د شعر لپاره یې ورته کلیمه وکاروله.
