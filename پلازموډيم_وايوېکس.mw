The [[parasite]] '''''Plasmodium vivax''''' is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of benign, but recurring (tertian), [[malaria]].  It is one of four species of parasite that commonly cause malaria infection in humans. It is less virulent than ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', the deadliest of the four, and seldom fatal. ''P. vivax'' is passed on by the female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito, since it is the only gender that bites. 

Asexual forms:
* Immature trophozoites (Ring or signet-ring shaped), about 1/3 of the diameter of a RBC.
* Mature trophozoites:  Very irregular and delicate (described as ''amoeboid''); many pseudopodial processes seen.  Presence of fine grains of brown pigment (malarial pigment) or hematin probably derived from the haemoglobin of the infected red blood cell.
* [[wiktionary:schizont|Schizonts]] (also called meronts):  As large as a normal red cell; thus the parasitized corpuslce becomes distended and larger than normal.  there are about sixteen merozoites.

Sexual forms:  Gametocytes:  Round.  The gametocytes of P. vivax are commonly found in the peripheral blood at about the end of the first week of parasitemia.

Microscopically, the parasitised [[red blood cell]] is up to twice as large as a normal cell and fine pink [[Sch√ºffner's stippling]] are seen on the cell's surface. The parasite within it is often wildly irregular in shape (described as "amoeboid").  [[wiktionary:schizont|Schizonts]] of ''P. vivax'' have up to twenty [[merozoite]]s within them.  It is rare to see cells with more than one parasite within them.  Merozoites will only attach to immature blood cell (reticulocytes) and therefore it is unusual to see more than 3% of all circulating erythrocytes parasitised.

''P. vivax'' and ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P. ovale]]'' that has been sitting in [[EDTA]] for more than half-an-hour before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'', which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives.  Blood films are preferably must be made within half-an-hour of the blood being drawn and must certainly be made within an hour of the blood being drawn.

The [[incubation]] period for the infection usually ranges from ten to seventeen days and sometimes up to a year. Persistent liver stages allow relapse up to five years after elimination of red blood cell stages and clinical cure. 

==Treatment==
[[Chloroquine]] remains the treatment of choice for ''vivax'' malaria, except in Indonesia's Irian Jaya ([[Western New Guinea]]) region and the geographically contiguous [[Independent State of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], where chloroquine resistance is common (up to 20% resistance).  When chloroquine resistance is common or when chloroquine is contraindicated, then [[artesunate]] is the drug of choice;<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pukrittayakamee S, ''et al.'' | title=Therapeutic responses to different antimalarial drugs in vivax malaria | journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother | year=2000 | volume=44 | issue=6 | pages=1680&ndash;5 }}</ref> [[mefloquine]] is a good alternative and in some countries is more readily available.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Maguire JD, Krisin, Marwoto H, Richie TL, Fryauff DJ, Baird JK | title=Mefloquine is highly efficacious against chloroquine-resistant ''Plasmodium vivax'' malaria and ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria in Papua, Indonesia | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=42 | issue=8 | pages=1067&ndash;72 }}</ref>  [[Quinine]] may be used to treat ''vivax'' malaria but is associated with inferior outcomes. Eradication of the liver stages is performed by primaquine administration, after checking the patients G6PD status to reduce the risk of haemolysis.
