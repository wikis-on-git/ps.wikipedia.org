The '''Co-operative Republic of Guyana''' is a [[nation]] on the northern coast of [[South America]], just above the Equator and a part of the western part of the wider region of [[Guiana]]. The country is bordered to the east by [[سورېنام]], to the south by [[برازيل]], to the west by [[Venezuela]] and to the north by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is the third smallest country in South America and approximately the size of [[Great Britain]] or [[Idaho]].

''Guyana'' is an [[Amerindian]] word meaning ''Land of Many Waters'', and the country is mostly characterized by vast unspoiled rain forests dissected by numerous rivers, creeks and beautiful waterfalls. It is also famous for being a proposed location of [[El Dorado (legend)|legendary El Dorado]], the inspiration for The Lost World, for its friendly multicultural society, high [[biodiversity]], prize-winning rum, wooden architecture, and [[Demerara (sugar)|Demerara sugar]]. Guyana's water walls is known to be one of the most popular attraction because it is inspired by the many waters of Guyana.

Though physically part of South America, culturally, Guyana is more Caribbean than Latin American—demonstrated by the fact that English is the main language — and it is often considered part of the [[West Indies]]. Other languages include [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Guyanese [[Creole English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hindustani]], [[Waiwai]], [[Arawak]] and [[Macushi]].

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[د ګيانا تاريخ]]''

At the time the first [[Europe]]ans arrived in the area around 1500, Guyana was inhabited by [[Arawak]] and [[Carib]] tribes of Amerindians.  European invasion/settlement began in the early [[17th century]] with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who established three separate colonies; [[Essequibo]] ([[1616]]), [[Berbice]] ([[1627]]), and [[Demerara]] ([[1752]]). The [[United Kingdom|British]] assumed control in the late [[18th century]] and the Dutch formally ceded the area in [[1814]]. The three became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]] in [[1831]].

The abolition of [[slavery]] in [[1834]] led to black settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured laborers from [[Madeira]] (Portugal) (beginning in 1834), [[Germany]] (first in 1835), [[Ireland]] (1836), [[Scotland]] (1837), [[Malta]] (1839), [[China]] and [[India]] (beginning in 1838) to work on the sugar plantations. In [[1889]] Venezuela claimed the land up to the Essequibo.  Ten years later an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to British Guiana; however, the dispute continues [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gy.html#Issues].

Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom in [[1966]] and became a [[republic]] in [[1970]], remaining a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The [[CIA]] and [[United States State Department]] along with the British government played a strong covert role in influencing who would control Guyana during this time.

== سياست ==
''Main article: [[د ګيانا سياست]]''

[[Legislative]] power rests in the [[unicameral]] Guyanese [[parliament]], called the National Assembly, with 53 members chosen on the basis of [[proportional representation]] from national lists named by the political parties. An additional 12 members are elected by regional councils at the same time as the National Assembly.

[[Executive (government)|Executive]] authority is exercised by the [[president]], who appoints and supervises the [[prime minister]] and other ministers. The president is not directly elected; each party presenting a slate of candidates for the assembly must designate in advance a leader who will become president if that party receives the largest number of votes. Any dissolution of the assembly and election of a new assembly can lead to a change in the assembly majority and consequently a change in the presidency. An ethnocultural divide between the two main ethnic groups has persisted and has on occasion led to turbulent politics.

The highest judicial body is the Court of Appeal, headed by a chancellor of the [[judiciary]]. The second level is the High Court, presided over by a chief justice. The chancellor and the Chief Justice are appointed by the president. The [http://www.audit.org.gy Audit Office of Guyana (AOG)] is the country's Supreme Audit Institution (SAI).

Guyana is a full and participating founder-member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]], the headquarters of which is located in Georgetown. The CARICOM Single Market & Economy (CSME) will, by necessity, bring Caribbean-wide [http://www.caricomlaw.org legislation] into force and a [http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/ Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ)].

== جغرافيه ==
[[دوتنه:Gy-map.png|thumb|Map of Guyana]]
''Main article: [[د ګيانا جغرافيه]]''

Guyana can be divided into three regions: a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the [[Atlantic]] coast where most of the population lives, then a white sand belt more inland consisting of dense [[rainforest]]s and containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits, and finally the larger interior highlands consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border. Guyana's main mountains are contained here, including [[Mount Ayanganna]] (6,699&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]; 2,042&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) and on [[Mount Roraima]] (9,301&nbsp;ft; 2,835&nbsp;m - highest mountain in Guyana) on the [[Brazil]]-Guyana-[[Venezuela]] [[tripoint]], part of the [[Pakaraima]] range. Roraima is said to be have been the inspiration for ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''. There are also many steep escarpments and waterfalls, including the famous [[Kaieteur Falls]]. Between the [[Rupununi River]] and the border with Brazil lies the [[Rupununi savannah]], south of which lie the [[Kanuku Mountains]].

There are many rivers in the country, the main four being (west to east) the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]], the [[Demerara River|Demerara]], the [[Berbice River|Berbice]] and the [[Courantyne River|Corentyne]] along the border with [[Suriname]]. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands. The 90 [[mile]] (145&nbsp;km) [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] along the north-west coast of Guyana is a major breeding area for [[turtle]]s and other wildlife.

The local [[climate]] is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast trade winds along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.

== اقتصاد ==
''Main article: [[د ګيانا اقتصاد]]''

The main economic activities in Guyana are [[agriculture]] (producing rice and Demerara sugar), [[bauxite]] mining, [[gold]] mining, timber, shrimp and minerals. The sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by [[Guysuco]] which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. The mineral industry, for example, is heavily invested in by the American company [[Reynolds Metals]] and the Canadian [[Alcan]] and the Korean/Malaysian [[Barama Company]] has a large stake in the logging industry.

The Guyanese economy has exhibited moderate economic growth since [[1999]], based on an expansion in the [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[mining]] sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low [[inflation]], and the continued support of international organizations. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled [[labor (economics)|labor]] and a deficient [[infrastructure]]. The government is juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities combined with troubles in the [[bauxite]] and [[sugar]] industries threaten the government's already tenuous fiscal position and dim prospects for the future.

Major private sector organizations include the [http://www.psc.org.gy Private Sector Commission (PSC)] and the [http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI)]; see a list of [[List of Guyanese companies|companies in Guyana]].

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Guyana]]''

Guyana's population of 751,223 ([http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/ Statistics Bureau], 2002) is diverse: the three largest groups are the [[India]]ns or [[Indo-Guyanese]] (43.5% in 2002) who have remained predominantly rural, the [[Africa]]ns or [[Afro-Guyanese]] (30.2%) who constitute the majority urban population, and those of mixed origin (16.7%). The [[Amerindian]]s (9.2%) who live in the country's interior, are divided into a number of different groups, the main ones being the [[Akawaio]], [[Arawak]], [[Carib]], [[Macushi]], [[Makuxi]], [[Pemon]] and [[Wapishana]]. Several smaller groups, including [[Ethnic Chinese|Chinese]], [[Portuguese (Guyana)|Portuguese]], "Whites" ([[Europe]]ans other than Portuguese, including [[United Kingdom|British]]) and others make up less than 1% of the population. The overwhelming majority of the population - around 90% - live along the coastal strip, where population density is more than 298 persons per [[square mile]] (115/km²). There is much racial tension between the Indian and African communities, and the two main parties are largely mono-racial. The trend over time is for the Amerindian and mixed-race proportion to grow, mainly at the expense of the Indo-Guyanese proportion, while the black percentage remains roughly stable. In 1980, Guyana had an absolute majority (51.9%) of Indo-Guyanese, but now no group forms a majority.

Religion in Guyana runs mainly along racial lines. [[Christianity]] (50%) predominantly [[Anglicanism]], is the main religion practiced by Afro-Guyanese, though some are [[Black Muslim]] or other Christian denominations. The Indo-Guyanese community mainly follow [[Hinduism]] (35%), though there is a sizable minority who practice [[Islam]] (10%). Guyana is the country with the largest percentage of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] (7%).

[[Emigration]] has been a large and persistent problem in Guyana, with an estimated 500,000 Guyanese living abroad. Since independence, as many as 10,000 Guyanese have left and settled permanently in the [[United States]] alone per year and demand to emigrate remains very high. [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and English-speaking Caribbean islands are the other main countries people choose to emigrate to. At the same time, the birth rate has fallen sharply, and because of the emigration, can no longer sustain the country's population level. Many in the government worry that the country may become depopulated, but few concrete steps have been taken to stem the outflow. Results from the 2002 census, however, suggest that emigration in the last decade has decreased somewhat compared to the 1980s.

'''Guyana's culture''' is very similar to that of the English-speaking [[Caribbean]]. It is so similar that Guyana is included and accepted as a Caribbean Nation and is a member of the Caribbean Community [[Caricom]] economic bloc. Only its geographical location differentiates it from the rest of the English speaking Caribbean countries. Guyana shares similar interests with the islands in the [[West Indies]], such as food, festive events, music, sports, etc.  Guyana plays international cricket as a part of the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies cricket team]], and the [[Guyanese cricket team|Guyana team]] plays [[first class cricket]] against other nations of the Caribbean. Further adding to its distinction as a member of the Caribbean community, Guyana is a member of [[CONCACAF]], the international football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean. 

''For Guyanese writers see [[Literature of Guyana]]''.

'''Music & Entertainment''' in Guyana follows the lead of other Caribbean countries and India. Radio stations play the latest [[reggae]], [[dancehall]], [[soca]] and [[chutney]] as well as [[Bollywood]] influences of bhangra and other hindi music. Local television stations air American, British and Indian broadcasts. Night clubs in Georgetown belt out the latest music late into the night on weekends.

== Ecology and World Heritage Site status ==
Countries interested in the conservation and protection of natural and cultural heritage sites of the world accede to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage that was adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1972.  Guyana is no exception, and signed the treaty in 1977.  In fact, Guyana was the first Caribbean State Party to sign the treaty.  Sometime in the latter half of the mid-1990s Guyana seriously began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination and three sites were considered: [[Kaieteur National Park]], [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] and Historic Georgetown.  By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun.  To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.

In 2000(?) Guyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the [[Kaieteur Falls]], to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination.  The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana’s most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of endemic species found anywhere in South America.  The Kaieteur Falls is the most spectacular feature of the park falling a distance of 226 m and exceeding the height of Niagara Falls (USA/Canada) five times.  Unfortunately, the nomination of Kaieteur Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000).  The dossier was thus returned to Guyana for revision.

Guyana continues in its bid for a World Heritage Site.  Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown – a Tentative List indicating Historic Georgetown as being put forward for nomination was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004.  There is now a small committee put together by the Guyana National Commission for UNESCO to complete the nomination dossier and the management plan for the site.  Recently, in April 2005, two Dutch experts in Conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising Architecture staff and students of the University of Guyana in a historic building survey of the selected area.  This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.  It is expected that the completed nomination document will be submitted in 2006.

Meanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the [[Iwokrama Forest]] and the [[Kanuku Mountains]].  The Iwokrama Rain Forest, an area rich in biological diversity, has been described by Major General (Rtd) Joseph Singh as “a flagship project for conservation.”   The Kanuku Mountains area is in a pristine state, and is home to more than 400 birds and animals.  These three sites together, we feel, more than adequately meet the requirements of exceptional natural beauty and biological diversity, as well as the requirements of size and integrity, for a successful nomination.

There is much work to be done for the successful nomination of these sites to the World Heritage List.  The State, the private sector and the ordinary Guyanese each have a role to play in this process and in the later protection of the sites.  Inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage will open Guyana to more serious tourists thereby assisting in its economic development.

Guyana exhibits two of the WWF's [[Global 200]] ecoregions most crucial to the conservation of global biodiversity, Guianan moist forests and Guyana Highlands moist forests and is home to several endemic species including the tropical hardwood [[Greenheart]] (''Chlorocardium rodiei'').

== Landmarks ==
* St. George's Anglican Church - Was the tallest wooden building in the world at the time of construction. Now dwarfed by other structures such as the [[Todaiji Temple]] in Japan. 

* Demerara Harbour Bridge - Was the longest floating bridge in the world. Now the fourth longest floating bridge in the world.

* [[Kaieteur Falls]] one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world.

* Caribbean Community (CARICOM) International Headquarters Building - houses the largest and most powerful political union in the Caribbean. 

* [[Providence Stadium]]-to be built on the east bank of the [[Demerara River]] for the ICC World Cup 2007. Construction has started. When completed it will be a major spot for leisure in Guyana. It will also be near the Providence Mall which, when completed, will be the largest mall in Guyana.

* Guyana International Conference Center - presented as a gift from the People's Republic of China to the Government of Guyana . It is the only one of its kind in the country .

* The [[1959]] film ''[[Green Mansions]]'', starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Anthony Perkins]], was filmed in Guyana (then British Guiana).

* Guyana is the only South American country where the [[death penalty]] is still in use for serious crimes and where [[homosexuality]] remains illegal.

* On [[November 18]] [[1978]], the [[Jonestown Massacre]] took place in the [[jungle]] of Northwest Guyana; 912 members of the [[cult]] died in a [[mass suicide]].

* ''The Guinness Book of Records'' (1990 ed) lists the Guyanese born [[Sir Lionel Luckhoo]] as "the world's most successful lawyer" because he obtained 245 consecutive acquittals for his clients that were accused of murder.

* Guyanese people say that if you visit Guyana and "Eat Labba and Drink Black Water", you are bound to return to Guyana.
