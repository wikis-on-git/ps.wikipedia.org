The '''Afghan National Army Air Corps''' (ANA Air Corps) is one of six "corps" of the [[military of Afghanistan]], and the only one responsible for [[air defense]] and [[air warfare]]. It was established officially in 1924 and for most of its history has functioned as a small but separate air service. The major exception was the 1980s when the Soviets built up the "Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force," first in an attempt to defeat the [[mujahideen]]-led insurgency and, by the end of the decade, in hopes that a strong Afghan air arm would preserve the pro-Soviet government of Dr [[Najibullah]]. 

In 1992, the collapse of the Najibullah Government and the continuation of a civil war among several competing mujahideen factions throughout the remainder of the decade reduced the Afghan air arm to a very small force with minimal capabilities. In the fall of 2001, the US/Coalition bombing campaign neutralized most of what remained of Afghan air power. Rebuilding efforts began shortly thereafter but were extremely limited for several years. Especially since May 2007, the US-led, international Combined Air Power Transition Force (CAPTF) has worked to rebuild and modernize the Afghan air arm, now designated the ANA Air Corps. The CAPTF serves as the air component of the US-led, international [[Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan]] which is responsible for rebuilding the Afghan armed forces.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_339.shtml ACIG Journal - Indian-Subcontinent Database (Afghanistan); Yves Debay and David Donald, "Wings over the Panjshir Valley," World Air Power Journal, vol. 40, Spring 2000]</ref>

== History ==
The history of the Afghan air service began on [[22 August]] [[1924]] as the Afghan Air Force. As early as 1921, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Great Britain]] provided a small number of aircraft to Afghanistan's King [[Amanullah Khan]] who had been impressed with the British use of aircraft against his government in 1919. For the next decade, Soviet pilots performed the bulk of the flying of Afghan aircraft, probably about one-half of which were [[Polikarpov R-1]]s, a Soviet copy of the de Havilland DH.9A. Most Afghan aircraft were destroyed in the civil war that began in December 1928, and it was 1937 before a serious rebuilding effort began. From the late 1930s until World War Two, British [[Hawker Hind]] and Italian [[IMAM Ro.37]] aircraft constituted the bulk of the small Afghan air service. The Hawker Hind remained in the Afghan inventory until 1957, and as of 2009 one former Afghan Air Force Hawker Hind still flew in the [[Shuttleworth Collection]]. In 1947, the air arm was redesignated the Royal Afghan Air Force, a title it retained until further political upheaval in 1973.<ref>Lennart Andersson, "The First Thirty Years of Aviation in Afghanistan," part 1, at [http://www.z-bok.se/Afghanistan.html] Edward Girardet, Afghanistan, The Soviet War (St. Martin's Press: New York, 1985), pg. 88; [http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_337.shtml ACIG Journal - Indian-Subcontinent Database (Afghanistan)]</ref>

By 1960, the Afghan air force consisted of approximately 100 combat aircraft including [[MiG-15]] fighters, [[Il-28]] light bombers, transports, and a few helicopters.<ref>Ludwig W. Adamec, Historical Dictionary of Afghan Wars, Revolutions, and Insurgencies (Scarecrow Press: Lanham, Md., Toronto, 2005, 2d ed.), pg. 52</ref> Also by that time, a small number of Afghan pilots were undergoing undergraduate pilot training in the United States; others attended training in the Soviet Union, [[India]], and several European countries. In the 1973 "bloodless" coup, [[King Zahir Shah]] was deposed and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] became the country's president. During his five years in power, until the Communist coup of 1978, Daoud relied on Soviet assistance to upgrade the capabilities and increase the size of the Afghan air force, introducing newer-models of Soviet-built [[MiG-21]] fighters and [[An-24]] and [[An-26]] transports. Improvements in the early-to-mid-1970s notwithstanding, the Afghan air arm remained relatively small until after the 1979-80 [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], intended to support the Afghan Communist regime against a growing insurgency. While Afghanistan's air force was equipped with a large inventory - probably some 400 aircraft in the mid-1980s - many of them were manned and maintained by "advisors" from [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Cuba]]. In many cases, the Soviets were reluctant to entrust Afghan pilots with either the latest aircraft models or high priority missions and, indeed, a number of Afghan pilots were equally reluctant to conduct air strikes against their countrymen.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm Keith J. Stalder, "The Air War in Afghanistan"]</ref>

The Afghan air force was at its strongest in the 1980s and early 1990s, producing some concern on the part of neighboring countries. The air service had at least 7,000 personnel plus 5,000 foreign advisors. At its peak, the air force had at least 240 fixed-wing combat aircraft (fighters, fighter-bombers, light bombers), 150 helicopters, and perhaps 40 or more [[Antonov]] transports of various models. Midway through the [[Soviet-Afghan war]], one estimate of Afghan air power listed the following inventory:

* 90 x [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] [[MiG-17]] - one regiment of MiG-17s and MiG-19s reported at [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in 1990.<ref>[[Flight magazine]] 1990 or The Encyclopaedia of World Air Forces</ref>
* 45 x [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] [[MiG-21]] - in 1990, thee squadrons were reported at [[Bagram Air Base]]<ref>[[Flight magazine]] or The Encyclopaedia of World Air Forces</ref>
* 60 x [[fighter-bomber]] [[Su-7]], [[Su-17]] ''Warplane,'' a British partwork, reported in its issue 21, published in 1985, that some 48 Su-7BMs, without Su-7UM two-seaters, had been supplied from 1970, forming the equipment of two fighter/ground attack squadrons at [[Shindand Airbase]].<ref>Orbis Publishing Ltd, 'Sukhoi Su-7 'Fitter' - Soviet Sledgehammer, 'Warplane, Vol. 2, Issue 21, p.413</ref>
* 45 x [[light bomber]] [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]]
* 150 x [[helicopter]] [[Mi-8]], [[Mi-24]]

Additionally, the Afghan air force probably operated some 40 or more transports, including the [[An-26]], [[An-24]], and [[An-2]].<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm Stalder, "Air War in Afghanistan"]</ref>

After the Soviet withdrawal and the departure of foreign advisors, the air force declined in terms of operational capability. With the collapse of the Najibullah Government in 1992, the air service ceased to be a single entity, instead breaking up amongst the different mujahideen factions in the ongoing civil war. By the end of the 1990s, the [[Taliban]] Government controlled the bulk of the surviving inventory, while the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]]/United Front operated a small number of helicopters and transports and a few other aircraft for which it depended on assistance from neighboring Tajikistan. With the breakdown of logistical systems, the cannibalization of surviving airframes was widespread. The US/Coalition operations in the fall of 2001 destroyed most of the remaining Afghan aircraft. It was 2005 before a US-led, international effort began to rebuild the Afghan air service; since 2007, the pace has increased significantly under the auspices of the Combined Air Power Transition Force.<ref>Debay, "Wings over Panjshir"</ref>

=== Mil Mi-35 Assault Helicopter ===
[[دوتنه:Afghan Mil Mi-35.jpg|thumb|220px|ANA Air Corps [[Mi-24]]s.]]
The Mil Mi-24/[[Mi-35]] (export model) assault [[helicopter]] has a long history in [[Afghanistan]]. The aircraft was operated extensively during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, mainly for attacking [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[mujahideen]] fighters, livestock, and villages as part of the Soviets' "scorched-earth" policy. Early in the war, both Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters proved vulnerable to mujahideen ground fire, especially the [[SA-7]], a Soviet-built, man-portable, heat-seeking, surface-to-air missile. 

Beginning in 1986, the US supplied the mujahideen with its state-of-the-art heat-seeking missile, the [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]], which the Afghans employed with devastating effect. In the first use of the Stinger in Afghanistan, mujahideen fighters downed three of eight unsuspecting Soviet Mi-24 Hinds as they approached the airfield at Jalalabad on a late September afternoon. Some scholars point to that event in 1986 as the turning point in the war. Moreover, for most of the remainder of the war when Stingers were known to be present, Soviet and Afghan aircraft elected to remain at higher altitudes where they were less vulnerable to the missile, but also less effective in ground attacks. Although employed extensively throughout the war as a ground attack platform, the Hind suffered from a weak tail boom and was found to be underpowered for some missions it was called upon to perform in the mountains of Afghanistan, where high [[density altitude]] is especially problematic for rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>Mohammad Yousaf and Mark Adkin, Afghanistan-The Bear Trap (Casemate: Havertown, Penn., 2001 [1992]), pp 174-80; [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SKJ.htm Stalder, "Air War in Afghanistan"]</ref>

Overall, the Hind proved effective and very reliable, earning the respect of both Soviet and Afghan pilots as well as ordinary Afghans throughout the country. The mujahideen nicknamed the Mi-24 the "Devil's Chariot" due to its notorious reputation. Since the end of the Soviet-Afghan war, the civil war of the 1990s, and the post-11 September 2001 US/Coalition operations, the ANA Air Corps is again operating the Hind, the export version of which is designated the Mi-35. As of August 2009, the Mi-35 provided the Air Corp's only ground attack capability and achieved initial operational capability.<ref>Yousaf, Afghanistan-The Bear Trap, pp 174-80</ref>

[[دوتنه:Afghan L-39 Albatross jets.jpg|thumb|220px|ANA Air Corps L-39 Albatross jets.]]
As of September 2009, the Afghan National Army Air Corps (ANA Air Corps) had 32 rotary-wing and 7 fixed-wing aircraft in serviceable condition. Under a partnering relationship between the US-led, international Combined Air Power Transition Force and the ANA Air Corps, Afghan air power is being rebuilt following several decades of war. This rebuilding is ongoing on several fronts:

* Infrastructure - the recently-opened North Kabul International Airport cantonment area includes the new headquarters for the Air Corps and 201st Kabul Air Wing. The wing's three operational squadrons, one fixed-wing, one rotary-wing, and the Presidential Airlift Squadron, are housed there. The cantonment area includes state-of-the-art hangars as well as operations, logistics, billeting, dining, and recreational facilities. Additionally, extensive Air Corps facilities are in-progress at Kandahar International Airport.    

* Inventory - by the end of 2009, the Air Corps expects to begin receiving new C-27A Spartan tactical transports and Mi-17V5 Hip transport helicopters. By the end of 2011, the Air Corps should possess 20 Spartans and 22 of the new Hips while continuing to operate several An-32 transports and the older Mi-17s. Further growth of the Air Corps may depend on decisions yet to be made regarding the size of the Afghan National Army which, in turn, will determine Air Corps requirements. In a country of rugged terrain possessing limited ground transportation options, the ANA depends heavily upon Air Corps fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft for airlift of soldiers and supplies between corps operating locations, medical and casualty evacuation, and transport of human remains. The Afghan government also relied on the Air corps for transportation of election materials during the August 2009 election.  Although presently the Mi-35s provide a ground attack capability, a decision is expected soon on the purchase of a light attack/trainer fixed-wing aircraft for the Air Corps.    

* Training - in May 2009, for the first time in several decades, a number of Afghan pilots and pilot-candidates traveled to the United States for English language training, to be followed by instrument training for the pilots and undergraduate pilot training for the pilot-candidates. This was the start of an initiative that within the next several years should produce a small cadre of seasoned, instrument-rated Afghan Air Corps pilots as well as a larger number of younger, well-trained pilots who will serve as the backbone of the Afghan air service for the next generation. Other Combined Air Power Transition Force-led programs include English language and technical courses for Air Corps personnel in various specialties including aircraft maintainence, logistics, communications, and engineering. As of June 2009, the Air Corps numbered about 2,400 personnel, with a planned strength of 7,400 members within several years.<ref>Department of Defense, [http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4126 Brief with Commander, CAPTF], January 24, 2008; [[Reuters]]: [http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSISL1047520070712?feedType=RSS U.S. to donate 186 aircraft to Afghanistan by 2012]; http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2009/02/afghan_national_army.php</ref>

The Afghan air arm deteriorated following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and collapse of the Najibullah Government in 1992, and it was nearly eliminated by US/Coalition air strikes in 2001. Especially since 2007, the redesignated Afghan National Army Air Corps has been gradually increasing its aircraft inventory, personnel, and operational capabilities, the result of extensive partnering with the US-led, international Combined Air Power Transition Force.

During its first incarnation, Afghan aircraft carried simple black and white depictions of the Muslim arms of Afghanistan, with the inscription 'God is great' on the underside of the wings.  The Afghan flag was possibly used as well.  Afghanistan adopted a black, red, and green flag after the 1929 revolt, and when the air force was given planes again in 1937, it placed this flag on the rudder, and adopted wing and fuselage roundels based on the three colors.

The Royal Afghan Air Force retained the roundels until adopting a new style in 1967, with a unique insignia consisting of a tri-color triangle using the national colors upon a white disc, on which was inscribed with Arabic lettering forming various phrases.  This roundel was placed on the rudder in place of the flag.  This remained in use after the overthrow of the monarchy until the Russian invasion in 1979, when a new insignia of a red disc with yellow inscriptions was adopted.  This was short-lived however, as in 1983, a more Soviet-standard red star on a white disc ringed in black, red, and green was adopted.  These were maintained until after the Soviet departure.

Upon the departure of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and the fall of the communist government, a return to the triangle insignia was noted, although markings varied depending on the ownership of the aircraft.
