A '''company''' is a form of [[Companies law|business organization]]. 

In the [[United States]], a company is a [[corporation]]&mdash;or, less commonly, an [[association]], [[partnership]], or [[union]]&mdash;that carries on an industrial enterprise."<ref name="Black's">Black's Law and lee Dictionary. Second Pocket Edition. Bryan A. Garner, editor. West. 2001.</ref> Generally, a company may be a "[[corporation]], [[partnership]], [[association]], [[joint-stock company]], [[Investment trust|trust]], [[Mutual fund|fund]], or organized group of [[person]]s, whether incorporated or not, and (in an official capacity) any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or similar official, or liquidating [[agent]], for any of the foregoing."<ref name="Black's"/> 

In [[English law]], and therefore in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, a company is a form of [[body corporate]] or corporation, generally registered under the [[United Kingdom company law|Companies Acts]] or similar legislation.  It does not include a [[partnership]] or any other unincorporated group of persons.

==Etymology==
The word ''company'' is traced from a 1150 A.D. O.Fr. term ''compaignie'' or "body of soldiers" and from L.L. ''companio'' (companion). The word's meaning of "subdivision of an infantry regiment" is from 1590. The use of the word in a sense of "business association" was first recorded 1553, having earlier been used in reference to [[trade guild]]s (1303). The abbreviation ''co.'' dates from 1769.<ref>{{OEtymD|company}}</ref>
In short a company can be defined as an artificial person having a separate legal entity, [[perpetual succession]] and a common seal.It is not affected by the death,lunacy or insolvency of a member.

==History==
According to one source, "it may be formed by Act of [[Parliament]], by Royal Charter, or by registration under company law (referred to as a limited liability or joint-stock company)."<ref name="crystal"/> In the [[United Kingdom]], the main regulating laws are the [[Companies Act 1985]] and the [[Companies Act 2006]].<ref name="crystal"/> Reportedly, "a company registered under this Act has limited liability: its owners (the shareholders) have no financial liability in the event of winding up the affairs of the company, but they might lose the money already invested in it".<ref name="crystal"/> In the USA, companies are registered in a particular state&mdash;[[Delaware]] being especially favoured&mdash;and become Incorporated (Inc). <ref name="crystal">"Company." Crystal Reference Encyclopedia. Crystal Reference Systems Limited. 27 Nov. 2007. [http://www.reference.com/browse/crystal/7755 Reference.com]</ref>

In [[North America]], two of the earliest companies were The [[London Company]] (also called the Charter of the Virginia Company of London)&mdash;a [[England|English]] [[joint stock company]] established by royal charter by [[James I of England]] on [[April 10]], [[1606]] with the purpose of establishing colonial settlements in [[North America]]&mdash;and [[Plymouth Company]] that was granted an identical charter as part of the [[Virginia Company]]. The London Company was responsible for establishing the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]], the first permanent English settlement in the present United States in 1607, and in the process of sending additional supplies, inadvertently settled the Somers Isles, alias [[Bermuda]], the oldest-remaining English colony, in 1609.

==Types==
:''For a country-by-country listing, see [[Types of business entity]].''

''There are various types of company that can be formed in different jurisdictions, but the most common forms of company (generally formed by registration under applicable companies legislation) are:''
*'''A [[company limited by guarantee]]'''.  Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities.  The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in [[England]].
*'''A [[Private limited company by shares|company limited by shares]]'''.  The most common form of company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested" with corporations being "the most common example of a limited company."<ref name="Black's"/> This type of company is common in [[England]].
*'''A company limited by guarantee with a share capital'''.  A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.  This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.<ref>Companies Act 2006</ref>
*'''A [[limited-liability company]]'''. "A company&mdash;statutorily authorized in certain states&mdash;that is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer", i.e., L.L.C.<ref name="Black's"/>
*'''An [[Unlimited Company|unlimited company]] with or without a share capital'''. A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited.

''Less commonly seen types of companies are:''
*'''Companies formed by letters patent'''.  Most corporations by letters patent are ''[[corporation sole|corporations sole]]'' and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
*'''[[Royal charter|charter corporations]]'''.  Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies.  Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfil a quasi regulatory function (for example, the [[Bank of England]] is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
*'''Statutory Companies'''.  Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.

Note that "Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC ([[public limited company]]) indicates that its shares are widely held."<ref name="crystal"/>

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the "members".  In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the [[shareholder]]s.  In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]] have created special forms of [[offshore company]] in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions.  Examples include "[[segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companiested purpose companies.

There are however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between '''[[public limited company|public companies]]''' and '''[[private company|private companies]]'''.  Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a regulated [[stock exchange]].  Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares.  In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.
