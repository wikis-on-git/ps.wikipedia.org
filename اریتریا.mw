The '''State of Eritrea''', or '''Eritrea''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name &#917;&#929;&#933;&#920;&#929;&#913;&#921;&#913; (''Erythraîa''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]), which derives from the Greek name for the [[Red Sea]]), is a country in [[east Africa|northeast Africa]]. It is bordered by [[سوډان]] in the west, [[اېتوپيا]] in the south, and [[جېبوتي]] in the southeast. The east and northeast of the country has an extensive coastline with the Red Sea. Having achieved independence on [[May 24]], [[1993]] from [[Ethiopia]], it is one of the youngest independent states.

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Eritrea]]''


Eritrea's coastal lowlands had been ruled by many powers before it was [[colonialism|colonised]] by the [[Italy|Italians]] in [[1885]].  Previously, the coast was long occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkey|Turks]], who then left it to their [[Egypt]]ian heirs in the mid [[19th century]].  The interior, particularly the [[Christian]] (predominantly [[Coptic Christianity | Coptic]]) Kebessa Highlands of [[Hamasien]], [[Akale Guzai]], and [[Serai]], were traditionally loosely associated with [[Ethiopia]].  An Italian [[Roman Catholic]] priest by the name of [[Sapetto]] purchased the port of [[Assab]] from the [[Afar Sultan]] (a vassal of the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]) on behalf of an Italian commercial conglomerate.  Later, as the Egyptians retreated out of Sudan during the [[Mahdist rebellion]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] brokered an agreement whereby the Egyptians could retreat through [[Ethiopia]], and in exchange they would allow the Emperor to occupy those lowland districts that he had disputed with the Turks and Egyptians.  Emperor [[Yohannis IV]] believed this included [[Massawa]], but instead, the port was handed by the Egyptians and the British to the Italians, who united it with the already colonised port of Asab to form a coastal Italian possession.  The Italians took advantage of disorder in northern Ethiopia following the death of Emperor [[Yohannis IV]] to occupy the highlands, and established their new colony, henceforth known as Eritrea, and achieved recognition by Ethiopia's new Emperor [[Menelik II]].

The Italians remained the colonial power in Eritrea until they were defeated by Allied forces in [[World War II]] ([[1941]]), and Eritrea became a [[British protectorate]]. After the war, the [[United Nations]], after a lengthy inquiry in which those who wanted union with Ethiopia and those who wanted independence lobbied the great powers and the [[United Nations|U.N.]] extensively, eventually reached a compromise that the former Italian colony was to join [[Ethiopia]] as part of a [[federation]].  Eritrea would have its own [[parliament]] and administration, and would be represented in the Ethiopian parliament which would function as the Federal Parliament.  The Emperor of Ethiopia, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], would be the [[monarch]] of Eritrea and would be represented there by a [[viceroy]].  Both unionists and pro-independence people found the federation to be undesirable. By a show of military force in the Eritrean Parliament the federation was dissolved by Ethiopia.  The Emperor agreed readily and annexed Eritrea in [[1960]] even over the serious reservations of his Prime Minister, [[Aklilu Habte-Wold]], who was ardently in favor of retaining the federation.  Promptly, pro-independence Eritreans went into rebellion and launched a long war of independence.  They were joined by disaffected federationists who now were convinced Eritrea would be better off as an independent state. The war would last 30 years.

The war of Eritrean Independence would escalate considerably after the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy in [[1974]], when a hardline [[Marxism|Marxist]] military junta known as the [[Derg]] seized power, and launched a major offensive in Eritrea.  The brutality of the government of dictator [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] did much to increase the numbers of the independence movements supporters to the point that Eritreans became almost exclusively pro-independence by the mid-[[1980s]].

The liberation struggle was dominated by two movements, the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF), often referred to as "Jebha", and by the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF), often known as "Shaebia".  The ELF was dominated by [[Muslim]] lowlanders, and was a conservative grass roots movement, whereas the EPLF was dominated by highlanders of Christian background, professing [[Marxism-Leninism]].  The ELF received backing from the more conservative Arab governments, whereas the EPLF from the more leftist ones, and some [[Eastern bloc]] countries which abandoned it in favor of the Derg regime in Ethiopia upon the Ethiopian revolution.  The ELF and EPLF made attempts to consolidate their operations, but soon found that they could not work together. The ELF was eventually overshadowed and eliminated by the EPLF.

The long war ended in [[1991]], when joint Eritrean and rebellious Ethiopian forces defeated the Ethiopian army, and the Derg regime fell. Two years later, after a [[referendum]], Eritrean independence was declared.  The leader of the EPLF, [[Isaias Afewerki]], became Eritrea's first Provisional [[President]].  The Eritrean Peoples Liberation front (EPLF or Shaebia), became the sole legal ruling party, and changed its name to the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ).  

In [[1998]], a border war with [[Ethiopia]] resulted in the deaths of some 70,000 people from both countries, and subjected Eritrea to significant economic and social stresses, including massive population displacement, reduced economic development, and one of [[Africa]]'s more severe [[land mine|landmine]] problems.  The Ethiopian government, once firm allies of the Eritrean authorities, expelled large numbers of Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean heritage from Ethiopia at the outset of the war.  These once-prosperous people found themselves suddenly dispossessed and dropped off in the border zone between the two countries, adding to the serious displaced-persons problem.  

In spite of initially promising economic and political strides, the Eritrean government cracked down on the free press and on opposition in 2001 when questions about the conduct of the war were raised.  The government also failed to implement the new [[Constitution]] and to hold long-promised elections. Later, the government of Eritrea enforced the Italian colonial practice of requiring government approval of all practiced religions.

The [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] ended in [[2000]] with a negotiated agreement known as the [[Algiers Agreement]].  One of the terms of the agreement was the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation, known as the [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] ([[UNMEE]]); over 4,000 UN peacekeepers remain as of [[August 2004]].  Another term of the Algiers Agreement was the establishment of a final demarcation of the disputed border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia.  An independent, UN-associated boundary commission known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), after extensive study, issued a final border ruling in [[April 2002]]. Ethiopia initially rejected the decision, but in November of 2004 said that it agreed to the border ruling "in principle." However, Ethiopia has massed some troops along the nations' border, but no widespread hostilities have erupted..

== Politics ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Eritrea]]''

The National Assembly of 150 seats, formed in [[1993]] shortly after independence, elected the current president, [[Isaias Afewerki]].  National elections have been periodically scheduled and cancelled.  Independent local sources of political information on Eritrean domestic politics are scarce; in [[September 2001]] the government closed down all of the nation's privately owned print [[media]], and outspoken critics of the government have been arrested and held without trial, according to various international observers, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]].  In 2004 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] declared Eritrea a [[Country of Particular Concern]] (CPC) for its alleged record of religious [[persecution]] (see below).

External issues include the border conflict with Ethiopia and the Sudan. After a high-level delegation to the Sudan from the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs ties are being normalized. The conflict with Ethiopia remains of primary concern and the stalemate has led the President to urge the UN to take action. Central to the continuation of the stalemate has to do with Ethiopia's inability to abide by the border demarcation ruling. This request is outlined in the [[Wikisource:Eleven Letters|Eleven Letters]] penned by the President. The situation is further escalated by the continued effort of the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders in supporting each other's opposition.

Eritrean National elections were set for 1997 and then postponed until 2001, it was then decided that because 20% of Eritrea's land was under occupation that elections would be postponed until the resolution of the conflict with Ethiopia. Local elections have continued in free Eritrea. The most recent round of local government elections were held in May 2003. On further elections, the President's Chief of Staff, Yemane Ghebremeskel said, 

:"''The electoral commission is handling these elections this time round so that may be the new element in this process. The national assembly has also mandated the electoral commission to set the date for national elections, so whenever the electoral commission sets the date there will be national elections. It’s not dependent on regional elections, although that might be a very helpful process.''

:''Multipartyism, in general principle yes, it is there but the law on political parties has to be approved by the national assembly. It was not approved the last time. The view from the beginning was that you don’t necessarily need a party law to hold national elections. You can have national elections and the party law can be adopted at any time. So in terms of commitment it’s very clear, in terms of the process it has its own pace, its own characteristics.''"[http://www.shaebia.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=9&num=2618&printer=1 shaebia.org]

== Administrative Divisions ==
[[Image:Eritrea regions numbered.png|thumb|[[Regions of Eritrea]]]]
''Main articles: [[Regions of Eritrea]], [[Districts of Eritrea]]''

Eritrea is divided into 6 [[region]]s and subdivided into approximately 55 [[district]]s.

The [[Regions of Eritrea|regions]] include:

# [[Central Region, Eritrea|Central]] (Maekel)
# [[Southern Region, Eritrea|Southern]] (Debub)
# [[Gash-Barka Region, Eritrea|Gash-Barka]]
# [[Anseba Region, Eritrea|Anseba]]
# [[Northern Red Sea Region, Eritrea|Northern Red Sea]] (Semienawi-Keih-Bahri)
# [[Southern Red Sea Region, Eritrea|Southern Red Sea]] (Debubawi-Keih-Bahri)

Districts: see [[Districts of Eritrea]]

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Eritrea]]''
[[Image:Er-map.gif|right]]

Eritrea is located in the [[Horn of Africa]] and is bordered on the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]]. The country is virtually bisected by the world's longest mountain range, the [[Great Rift Valley]], with fertile lands to the west and the descent to desert in the East. Off the sandy and arid coastline is situated the [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds. The land to the south, in the highlands, is slightly less dry and cooler. Eritrea at the southern end of the Red Sea is the home of the fork in the rift. The [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another: the Arabian Plate, and the two parts of the African Plate (the Nubian and the Somalian) splitting along the East African Rift Zone (USGS). The highest point of the country, [[Soira]], is located in the centre of Eritrea, at 9,902 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (3,018&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) above sea level.

The main cities of the country are the capital city of [[Asmara]] and the port town of [[Assab]] in the southeast, as well as the towns of [[Massawa]] and [[Keren]].

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Eritrea]]''

Since independence from [[Ethiopia]], Eritrea has faced the economic problems of a small, desperately poor country. Like the economies of many [[Africa]]n nations, the economy is largely based on subsistence [[agriculture]], with 80% of the population involved in farming and herding. 

The Ethiopia-Eritrea war severely hurt Eritrea's economy. [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth in [[1999]] fell to less than 1%, and GDP decreased by 8.2% in [[2000]]. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into northern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss, including losses of $225 million in [[livestock]] and 55,000 homes. The attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive region, causing food production to drop by 62%.

Even during the war, Eritrea developed its transportation [[infrastructure]], asphalting new roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged roads and bridges. Eritrea's economic future remains mixed. The cessation of Ethiopian trade, which mainly used Eritrean ports before the war, leaves Eritrea with a large economic hole to fill. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master fundamental social problems like [[illiteracy]], [[unemployment]], and low skills, and to convert its diaspora money and expertise into economic growth.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Eritrea]]''
[[Image:Eritrea demography.png|thumb|Population 1993-2003]]
Eritrea's two main ethnic groups are the [[Tigrigna]], who represent about half of the population, and the [[Tigre language|Tigre]], who are about 40%. The remaining people are the [[Kunama]], [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]], [[Bilen]], [[Hidareb]], [[Nara]], [[Rashaida]], and [[Saho]]. The local [[Tigrigna]] and the wider [[Arabic language|Arabic]] language are the two predominant languages for official purposes, but [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] are also spoken.

[[Dahlik language|Dahlik]] is a newly discovered language spoken on the [[Dahlak Archipelago]].

==Religion==
The dominant religions are [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], each group representing roughly 50% of the population. The Christians consist primarily of the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church]], which is the local [[Oriental Orthodox]] church, but small groups of [[Roman Catholic]]s, [[Protestant]]s, and other religions also exist.

Members of the Eritrean Orthodox Church are sometimes described as [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Christians]] because the hierarchy of that church was formerly subject to that of the Tawahido Church of [[Ethiopia]], which was in turn formerly (before [[1950]]) subject to the Coptic Pope. However, the word ''Coptic'' in modern usage refers primarily to the [[Coptic Christian|Egyptian Orthodox]] branch of Christianity. The Eritrean and Ethiopian Orthodox churches are still in [[full communion]] with the Coptic Church in Egypt. In 1993 the [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]] was granted [[autocephaly]], and in 1998 the Archbishopric of [[Asmara]], the young nation's capital, was elevated to the rank of patriarchate, within the Oriental Orthodox church. 

The vast majority of Muslims in Eritrea are [[Sunni]].

Since May [[2002]], the government of Eritrea has only officially recognized the Eritrean Orthodox Church, [[Sunni Islam]], [[Catholicism]] and the Evangelical [[Lutheran]] church. All other faiths and denominations were required to under go a registration process that was so stringent as to effectively be prohibitive.  Amongst other things, the government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership in order to be allowed to [[worship]]. The few organisations that have met all of the registration requirements have still not received official recognition. Other faith groups like [[Jehovah's Witnesses, Bahais, the Seventh Day Adventists and numerous Protestant denominations]] are not registered and cannot worship freely. They have effectively been banned, and harsh measures have been taken against their adherents. Over twenty Protestant pastors and almost 2000 church members have so far been detained indefinately and without charge.  In addition several Orthodox priests have also been detained, and the Patriarch of the Orthodox church has been removed from office and placed under stringent house arrest ostensibly for objecting to government interference in church affairs.

As of 2004, a number of [[refugee]]s have been fleeing the country to [[Kenya]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Northeast Africa| and beyond]] because of this lack of freedom and given the large number of [[Political prisoner|prisoner]]s of [[conscience]].
