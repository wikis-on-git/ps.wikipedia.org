Zekr is an open platform Quran study tool for simply browsing and researching on the Holy Quran. It is a Quran-based project, planned to be a universal, open source, and cross-platform application to perform most of the usual refers to Quran. The main idea is to build an as generic as possible platform to accept different Islamic resources. 

Zekr is written in Java, on Eclipse platform, and uses SWT as widget toolkit. 

It works on different platforms, including Windows (2k, XP, Vista), Linux (most important distributions), and Mac. It requires Java 1.4.2 (or newer). See installation page for more info.
