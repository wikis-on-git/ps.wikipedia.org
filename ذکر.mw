'''Zekr''' is an [[open source]] [[Quran]]ic desktop application.
It is an under-development project, but there are always stable releases available for download. The current release version is 0.6.6. It now supports managed/scoped searching of the whole Quran and translations, with matching and non-matching [[Diacritic|diacritics]] plus [[translation]] and [[Theme (computing)|theme]] support. More, in the current release, it supports [[Bookmark_%28books%29|Bookmark Set]] management, including import/export, multiple bookmark sets, etc.

Zekr comes with an installer for [[Windows]] and an [[Application bundle]] for [[Mac OS|Mac]]. It can also be run on [[Linux]] machines (a Debian installer package is available).
Zekr is an open platform Quran study tool for simply browsing and researching on the Holy Quran. It is a Quran-based project, planned to be a universal, open source, and cross-platform application to perform most of the usual refers to Quran. The main idea is to build an as generic as possible platform to accept different Islamic resources. 

Zekr is written in Java, on Eclipse platform, and uses SWT as widget toolkit. 

It works on different platforms, including Windows (2k, XP, Vista), Linux (most important distributions), and Mac. It requires Java 1.4.2 (or newer). See installation page for more info.
