'''Singapore''', formally the '''Republic of Singapore''' ({{lang-ms|''Republik Singapura''}}; [[Simplified Chinese character|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|新加坡共和国}}, [[Pinyin]]: ''Xīnjiāpō Gònghéguó''; {{lang-ta|சிங்கப்பூர் குடியரசு}}, {{lang|ta|''Ciŋkappūr Kudiyarasu''}}), is an [[Island nation|island]] [[city-state]] and the smallest country in [[Southeast Asia]]. It is located on the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]], south of the [[مالېزيا|Malaysian]] state of [[Johor]], and north of the [[اندونېزيا|Indonesian]] [[Riau Islands]]. It lies just 137 kilometres (85&nbsp;[[mile]]s) north of the [[Equator]]. 

The site of several ancient [[port]] cities and a possession of several empires in its history, Singapore was a [[Malay people|Malay]] [[fishing]] [[village]] when it was colonised by the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century. It was further [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|occupied by the Japanese Empire]] in [[World War II]], and was later part of the merger which established the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]]. When Singapore acquired independence, having few [[natural resource]]s, it was sociopolitically volatile and economically undeveloped. Foreign investment and rapid government-led [[industrialisation]] has since created an economy which relies on exports of [[electronics]] and [[manufacturing]] primarily from [[Port of Singapore|its port]]. 

According to the quality-of-life index assembled by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], Singapore has the highest standard of living in Asia, and is ranked 11th in the World. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.economist.com/theworldin/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3372495&d=2005 Worldwide quality-of-life index | title = Singapore's position in the World in terms of Quality of Life | publisher = [[The Economist]] | accessdate = 2006-8-17}} </ref> In the more well-known [[Human Development Index]] by the [[United Nations]], Singapore holds the 25th place, behind only Japan and Hong Kong in Asia (since [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and [[Macau]] aren't officially ranked). Measured by [[GDP per capita]], Singapore is the 22nd wealthiest country. The comparatively high ranking in the index by the Economist Intelligence Unit reflects the strong emphasis placed by this index on stable family life and low crime levels.

More than 90% of Singapore's population lives in [[housing estate]]s constructed by the [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Board]] and nearly half uses the [[public transport]] system daily <ref name="dailyridership">{{cite web |  url = http://www.lta.gov.sg/corp_info/doc/Stats%20In%20Brief%20(2005).pdf | title = Singapore Land Transport: Statistics In Brief 2005 | publisher = [[Land Transport Authority]] | accessdate = 2005-12-07}} </ref>. As a result of efforts to control motorised traffic, the maintenance of natural greenery, strict regulations on industrial locations and emissions, and other pro-environmental initiatives by the government and the private sector, Singapore has been able to control its pollution levels to well within [[World Health Organization]] standards <ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.mewr.gov.sg/sgp2012/index.html | title = Singapore Green Plan 2012 | publisher = [[Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources]] | accessdate = 2006-08-14}} </ref>. The [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution of the Republic of Singapore]] established the city-state as a [[representative democracy]]. Singapore initially undertook a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] policy shortly after its independence, adopting a [[welfare economics|welfare]] system. However, the [[Government of Singapore|government]] has since become more conservative than it was at the founding of the republic. Singapore faces criticism for being a reduced democracy because of its [[dominant-party system]] and has attracted controversy for some of its policies.

== History ==
{{main|History of Singapore}}
The name ''Singapore'' is derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] words {{lang|ms|''singa''}} (lion) and {{lang|ms|''pura''}} (city), which were themselves derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words {{lang|sa|सिंह}} ''siṃha'' and {{lang|sa|पुर}} ''pura''.<ref> {{cite web |  url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html | title = Singapore| publisher = bartleby.com | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }}</ref> Hence, Singapore is also known as the ''Lion City''. The naming is attributed to a [[prince]] named [[Sang Nila Utama]], who according to folklore, saw a [[lion]] as the first living creature on the island and decided to name it Singapura as a result.<ref> {{cite web| title = Early History | url = http://www.sg/explore/history.htm | publisher = Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }} </ref>

The first records of Singapore's existence are in [[China|Chinese]] texts from the 3rd century AD. The island was an outpost of the [[Sumatra]]n [[Srivijaya]] empire and originally bore the [[Javanese]] name ''[[Temasek]]'' (which means sea town). Temasek (Tumasek) rose to become a significant trading city, but subsequently declined. There are few remnants of old Temasek in Singapore, but [[archaeology in Singapore|archaeologists in Singapore]] have uncovered evidence of the civilization, as well as other settlements. Between the 16th and early 19th centuries, Singapore was a part of the [[Sultanate of Johor]]e, a vassal kingdom of Siam. During the Malay-[[Portugal]] wars in 1613, Singapore was set ablaze by Portuguese troops.<ref name="uslcPrecolonial"> {{cite web | title = Singapore - Precolonial Era | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/3.htm | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress  | accessdate = 2006-06-18 }} </ref>

[[دوتنه:Stamford Raffles statue.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] by [[Thomas Woolner]], erected at the spot where he first landed at Singapore. He is recognised as the founder of modern Singapore.]]

In 1819, Sir [[Stamford Raffles|Thomas Stamford Raffles]], an official with the [[British East India Company]], signed a treaty with the Sultan of Johore. He also established Singapore as a trading post and settlement, which saw instant growth and immigration from various ethnic groups. Singapore was later made a [[British overseas territories|crown colony]] by Britain in 1867. After a series of colonial territorial expansions, the British Empire soon raised Singapore's status to that of an [[Entrepôt|entrepot]] town, due to its strategic location along the busy shipping routes connecting [[Europe]] to China.<ref> {{cite web| title = Founding of Modern Singapore | url = http://www.sg/explore/history_founding.htm | publisher = Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }} </ref>

During [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] invaded [[Malaya]] and the surrounding region in the [[Battle of Malaya]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Singapore]]. The British were unprepared and swiftly defeated, despite having more troops. They surrendered to the Japanese on [[15 February]] [[1942]]. The Japanese renamed Singapore as ''Syonan-to'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for "Light of the South", and occupied it until the British arrived to repossess the island a month after [[Surrender of Japan|the Japanese surrender]] in September 1945.<ref> {{cite web | author = Ron Taylor | title = Fall of Malaya and Singapore | url = http://www.britain-at-war.org.uk/Malaya_and_Singapore/body_index.htm | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }} </ref>

Singapore became a self-governing state in 1959 with [[Yusof bin Ishak]] as its first [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara|head of state]] and [[Lee Kuan Yew]] from the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) as its first [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], after the 1959 elections. The [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|Merger Referendum]] passed in 1962 and led to Singapore joining the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] along with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] as a state with [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] powers in September 1963. Singapore was expelled from the federation on [[7 August]] [[1965]] after [[PAP-UMNO relations|heated ideological conflict]] developed between the state government formed by PAP and the Federal government in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. It gained official sovereignty two days later on [[9 August]] [[1965]], which later became Singapore's National Day. Malaysia was the first country to recognise it as an independent nation.<ref> {{cite web| title = Road to Independence | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }} </ref>

The fledgling nation had to become self-sufficient, and faced problems including mass [[unemployment]], housing shortages and lack of land and natural resources such as [[petroleum]]. During Lee Kuan Yew's term as prime minister from 1959 to 1990, his administration immediately curbed unemployment, raised the [[standard of living]] and implemented a large-scale public housing programme. The country [[economic]] infrastructure was developed, the threat of racial tension was eliminated and an independent national defence system was created. Singapore evolved from a [[Developing country|developing nation]] to a [[global city]] with [[developed country|first world status]] towards the end of the 20th century.<ref> {{cite web| title = Country Groups | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~menuPK:64133156~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html | publisher = [[The World Bank]] | accessdate = 2006-05-02 }} </ref>

In 1990, [[Goh Chok Tong]] succeeded Lee as Prime Minister. During his tenure, the country tackled the economic impacts of the 1997 [[East Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] and the 2003 [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] outbreak, as well as [[War on Terrorism|terrorist threats]] posed by the [[Jemaah Islamiyah|Jemaah Islamiah]] (JI) [[September 11 attacks|post-September 11]] and the [[Bali bombings]]. In 2004 [[Lee Hsien Loong]], the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the third prime minister.<ref> {{cite web| title =  Country profile: Singapore | publisher = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1143240.stm | accessdate = 2006-04-14}} </ref>

== Politics and government ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Politics of Singapore}}
Singapore is a [[republic]] with a [[Westminster system]] of a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament|parliamentary government]] representing different [[constituencies of Singapore]]. The bulk of the executive powers rests in the hands of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]], which consists of ministers led by the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]]. The office of the [[President of Singapore]] was, historically, a ceremonial one as [[head of state]], but the [[Constitution of Singapore]] was amended in 1991 to create the position of a popularly elected President and also to grant the President [[veto]] powers in a few key decisions such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of key [[judiciary]] positions.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Presidency in Singapore | work=Istana website | url=http://www.istana.gov.sg/pro.html |  accessdate=2005-01-30 }} </ref> The [[Legislature|legislative]] branch of government is the Parliament. [[Parliamentary elections in Singapore]] are [[plurality voting system|plurality-based]] for group representation constituencies since the [[Parliamentary Elections Act]] was modified in 1991. <ref> {{cite web|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|publisher=Singapore Statutes Online|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2001-REVED-218&doctitle=PARLIAMENTARY%20ELECTIONS%20ACT%0A&segid=946439076-000003|accessdate=2006-05-08}}</ref>

Singaporean politics have been dominated by the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) since the country's independence in 1965.<ref> {{cite book | author=Worthington, Ross | title=Governance in Singapore | publisher=Routledge/Curzon | year=2002 | id=ISBN 0-7007-1474-X}}</ref> Foreign political analysts and several opposition parties including the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]] and the [[Singapore Democratic Party]] (SDP) have argued that Singapore is a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Single-party state|one-party state]]. Many consider the form of government in Singapore to be closer to [[authoritarianism]] such as [[illiberal democracy]] or [[procedural democracy]] rather than true [[democracy]]. [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked Singapore 140th out of 167 countries in its 2005 Worldwide Press Freedom Index. It has also been alleged that the PAP employs [[censorship]], [[gerrymandering]] by the [[Elections Department]] and the filing of civil suits against the opposition for [[Slander and libel|libel or slander]] to impede their success. Several former and present members of the opposition, including [[Francis Seow]], [[J.B. Jeyaretnam]] and [[Chee Soon Juan]] perceive the Singaporean courts as favourable towards the government and the PAP due to a lack of [[separation of powers]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=554
| title=Worldwide Press Freedom Index | accessdate=2006-04-13}} </ref> Although no PAP member has ever lost a defamation case in court, there are three cases in which opposition leader [[Chiam See Tong]] sued PAP members for defamation and successfully obtained an out-of-court settlement. <ref> {{cite news| title= Resolution: Singapore Case N SIN/01 - Joshua Jeyaretnam | publisher = Inter-Parliamentary Union | date = 23 March 2002 | url  = http://www.ipu.org/hr-e/170/Sin01.htm }} </ref>

Singapore has what its government considers to be a highly successful and transparent [[market economy]]. The PAP's policies contain some aspects of [[socialism]]. The [[Housing Development Board]] oversees a large-scale public housing programme and [[education in Singapore]] is a rigorous [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[public education]] system, and the dominance of government-controlled companies in the local economy. Although dominant in its activities, the government has a clean, [[Political corruption|corruption-free]] image. Singapore has consistently been rated as the least-corrupt country in [[Asia]] and amongst the top ten cleanest from corruption in the world by [[Transparency International]].<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi | title = Transparency International - Corruption Perceptions Index 2005 | accessdate = 2006-04-13 }} </ref>

Although Singapore's laws are inherited from British and [[British India]]n laws, including many elements of [[English common law]], the PAP has also consistently rejected [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic values]], which it typifies as [[Western world|Western]] and states that there should not be a 'one-size-fits-all' solution to a democracy. Laws restricting the [[freedom of speech]] are justified by claims that they are intended to prohibit speech that may breed ill will or cause disharmony within Singapore's multiracial, multi-religious society. For example, in September 2005, three [[blog]]gers were convicted of [[sedition]] for posting [[Racism|racist]] remarks targeting minorities.<ref> {{cite news| title= Third racist blogger sentenced to 24 months supervised probation | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/180127/1/.html | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=23 November 2005}} </ref> Some offences can lead to heavy fines or [[caning]] and there are laws which allow [[capital punishment in Singapore]] for [[Murder|first-degree murder]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. [[Amnesty International]] has criticised Singapore for having "possibly the highest execution rate in the world" [[per capita]].<ref> {{cite web | title = Amnesty International | work = The death penalty: A hidden toll of executions | url = http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA360012004?open&of=ENG-SGP | accessdate =7 June | accessyear = 2005}} </ref> The Singapore government argued that there is no international consensus on the appropriateness of the death penalty and that Singapore has the [[Sovereignty|sovereign right]] to determine its own judicial system and impose capital punishment for the most serious crimes. <ref>{{cite web|title = The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report "Singapore - The Death Penalty: A Hidden Toll Of Executions" | publisher = Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore | url = http://www2.mha.gov.sg/mha/detailed.jsp?artid=1770&type=3&root=0&parent=0&cat=65 | date = 2004-01-30 }} </ref> However, more recently the PAP government has relaxed some of its [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies and created a "Feedback Unit"<ref>[http://app.feedback.gov.sg Feedback Unit, Singapore]</ref> to encourage citizens to share their views on policies and public services.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography and climate of Singapore}}
[[دوتنه:Singapore Planning Regions.png|thumb|right|250px|Singapore is divided into 55 [[urban planning areas of Singapore|urban planning areas]], grouped into 5 [[Regions of Singapore|regions]].]]
[[دوتنه:Singapore_botanic_garden_pond_(2004).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Singapore Botanic Gardens]], a 52-hectare (128&nbsp;[[acre]]) botanical garden in Singapore that includes the National Orchid Garden which has a collection of more than 3,000 species of [[orchid]]s.]]
[[دوتنه:CentralSingapore.JPG|thumb|right|250px|View of the central part of the city.]]

Singapore consists of 63 islands, including the main island itself. There are two connections from Singapore to the Malaysian state of Johor — a man-made [[causeway]] known as the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]] to the north, crossing the [[Tebrau Straits]], and [[Malaysia-Singapore Second Link|Tuas Second Link]], a bridge in the western part of Singapore that connects to Johor. [[Jurong Island]], [[Pulau Tekong]], [[Pulau Ubin]] and [[Sentosa]] are the largest of Singapore's many smaller islands. The highest point of Singapore is [[Bukit Timah|Bukit Timah Hill]], with a height of 166 metres (538&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

The urban area used to be only concentrated on the southern part of Singapore around the mouth of the [[Singapore River]] and what is now the [[Downtown Core]], while the rest of the land was [[tropical rainforest]] or used for [[agriculture]]. Since the 1960s, the government has constructed new towns in outlying areas, resulting in an entirely built-up and urban landscape, although the [[Central Area]], the [[central business district]], remains the densest. The [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] is a government agency responsible for the [[urban planning in Singapore|urban planning of Singapore]] that concentrates on efficient land use and distribution, as well as transport flow. It has released a [[Development Guide Plan]] which details specific land use for each the 55 [[urban planning areas of Singapore]]. 

Singapore has [[land reclamation|reclaimed land]] with earth obtained from its own hills, the seabed and neighbouring countries. As a result, Singapore's land area grew from 581.5 square kilometres (224.5&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) in the 1960s to 697.2 square kilometres (269.1&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) today, and may grow by another 100 square kilometres (38.6&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) by 2030.<ref> {{cite web| title = Towards Environmental Sustainability, State of the Environment 2005 Report (PDF)| publisher = Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore  | accessdate = 2006-04-14| url = http://app.nea.gov.sg/counter/nea_soecover.asp }}</ref> About 23% of Singapore's land area consists of forest and nature reserves.

Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinct seasons, under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Its climate is characterised by uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity and abundant rainfall. Temperatures range from 22°[[Celsius|C]] to 34&nbsp;°C (72°–93°[[Fahrenheit|F]]). On average, the [[relative humidity]] is around 90% in the morning and 60% in the afternoon. During prolonged heavy rain, relative humidity often reaches 100%.<ref> {{cite web| title = Climate of Singapore | url = http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=1088 | publisher = National Environment Agency, Singapore | accessdate = 2006-04-14}}</ref> The lowest and highest temperature recorded in its maritime history is 18.4&nbsp;°C (65.1&nbsp;°F) and 37.8&nbsp;°C (100.0&nbsp;°F) respectively. The highest wind speed recorded is 120km/h on July 27, 2001. Meteorologists thus had a debate over whether or not to consider it a typhoon. In the end, it was decided that because it had only occurred over a short time span of a few seconds, it is not sustained and thus cannot be considered a typhoon.

Urbanisation has eliminated many areas of primary rainforest that once existed, with the only remaining area of primary rainforest being [[Bukit Timah Nature Reserve]]. A variety of parks, however, are maintained with human intervention, such as the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]]. Without natural [[Fresh water|freshwater]] rivers and lakes, the primary domestic source of [[water supply]] in Singapore is [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]], collected in reservoirs or catchment areas. Rainfall supplies approximately 50% of Singapore's water; the remainder is imported from Malaysia or obtained from [[Reclaimed water|recycled water]] facilities, a product called [[NEWater]] and [[desalination]] plants. More NEWater and desalination plants are being built or proposed to reduce reliance on foreign supply.<ref>{{cite web| title = Clean Water | publisher = Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore | accessdate = 2006-04-14| url = http://app.mewr.gov.sg/home.asp?cid=167&nid=167&id=SAS763 }} </ref>

== Economy and Tourism ==
{{main|Economy of Singapore}}
[[دوتنه:Merlion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The [[Merlion]] is one of the best-known tourist icons of Singapore.]]
[[دوتنه:Lit-up_CBD_from_Raffles_City_-_RGW.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Central Area]] is the [[central business district]] and hub of economic transactions in Singapore, and is also the home of the [[Singapore Exchange]], Asia-Pacific's first de-mutualised and integrated securities and derivatives exchange.]]
Singapore has a highly developed [[Market economy|market-based economy]], and is often considered to be a [[developed nation]]. It ranks 25th on the [[Human Development Index]]<ref> [http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf 2005 UN Human Development Index Report (PDF)]</ref> which measures [[standard of living]], and second in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]]. Although Singapore has one of the highest per capita [[gross domestic product]]s (GDP) in the world, domestic demand is relatively low due to the small population.

The economy depends heavily on exports produced from refining imported goods in a form of extended [[entrepot]] trade, especially in manufacturing. Manufacturing contributes around 28% to GDP in 2005. The manufacturing industry is today well-diversified with electronics, chemicals, mechanical engineering and biomedical sciences manufacturing. Along with [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], Singapore's fast-paced industrialization earned it a place as one of the four original '[[East Asian Tigers]]'.

In 2001, a [[Early 2000s recession|global recession]] and slump in the technology sector caused the GDP to contract by 2.2%. The Economic Review Committee (ERC), set up in December 2001, recommended several policy changes with a view to revitalising the economy. Singapore has since recovered from the recession, largely due to improvements in the world economy; the Singaporean economy itself grew by 8.3% in 2004 and 6.4% in 2005.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://app.mti.gov.sg/data/article/1962/doc/ESS_2005Ann_%20PR.pdf | title = Performance of the Singapore Economy in 2005 (PDF), Ministry of Trade and Industry | accessdate = 2006-04-14}}  </ref> In the long term, the government hopes to establish a new growth path which will be less vulnerable to the external business cycle, as compared to the current export-led model. However, the government is unlikely to abandon efforts to establish Singapore as Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub. The per capita GDP in 2005 was US$26,833<ref> {{cite web| title =  Per Capita GDP at Current Market Prices | url = http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/hist/gdp.html | publisher = Singapore Department of Statistics| date = 2006-02-16 }} </ref> and the unemployment rate was 2.9% in June 2006, up from 2.5% in January the same year.<ref> {{cite news | title =  Singapore's employment hits all-time high of 2.3 m in 2005  | author= May Wong | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 1 February 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/191175/1/.html }}</ref> 81,500 new jobs were created from January-July 2006, the highest number in a decade within a 6 month period. The economy is expected to grow by 6.5% to 7.5% in the year 2006, after a strong 9.4% growth in the first half of Year 2006 (Jan-Jul 2006). Initially, Lee Hsien Loong, who is the current Finance and Prime Minister, expected growth to be between 4-6% for the whole year.

Singapore introduced a [[Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) with an initial rate of 3% on [[1 April]] [[1994]]. This has substantially increased government revenue by $1.6 billion, stabilising the government's finances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_1996/revenue.html|title=FY 1996 Budget, Revenue And Tax Changes|accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref> The government has used revenue from the GST to reorient the economy around services and [[value added]]-goods to reduce dependence on electronics manufacturing. The taxable GST was increased to 4% in 2003 and to 5% in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://app.feedback.gov.sg/asp/pol/pol01d1.asp?id=172|title=Policy Digest: Phased GST increase|accessdate=2006-04-26|year=[[December 21]], [[2002]]}}</ref>

Singapore is a popular travel destination, making [[Tourism in Singapore|tourism]] one of its largest industries. In 2005, a total of 9.05 million tourists visited Singapore. Much of its attraction can be attributed to its cultural diversity that reflects almost 200 years of colonial history with immigrant cultures originating from Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian and Arab ethnicities. The [[Orchard Road]] district, which is dominated by multi-storey shopping centres and hotels, is the centre of tourism in Singapore. Other popular tourist attractions include the [[Singapore Zoo]] and its [[Singapore Night Safari|Night Safari]] along with the tourist island of [[Sentosa]]. To attract more tourists, the government decided in 2005 to legalise [[gambling]] and to allow two [[Integrated Resort]]s to be developed at [[Marina South]] and Sentosa.<ref> {{cite web| title = Proposal to develop Integrated Resorts - Ministerial Statement by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 18 April 2005| url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/casino/text_pmlee.htm }} </ref>

== Military and defence ==
[[دوتنه:Singapore Gurkha 01.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Gurkha Contingent]] of the [[Singapore Police Force]], with its members recruited from [[Nepal]], is a [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] force in the country. Here, the officers join local officers in the annual Police Day Parade.]]
{{main|Military of Singapore|Total Defence}}
The military of Singapore serves primarily as a deterrent to potential invaders of the island. Singapore has mutual defence pacts with several allies that it militarily cooperates with, such as those in the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]]. Singapore uses the concept of [[Total Defence]], which classifies defence into five aspects. Besides the military, the other four aspects of Total Defence are [[Civil defense|civil defence]], which is carried out by the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]], and concepts of 'economic defence', 'psychological defence', and 'social defence'. 

The military of Singapore comprises various armed forces collectively known as the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF). Various agencies of the [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]] (MINDEF) and some private companies also play a supporting role. The military of Singapore is one of the most modernised in Asia, with its current standing reflecting the continued emphasis of the government on military defence — military expenditures dominate the annual government budget.

The recent uses of [[unconventional warfare]] and [[terrorism]] have elevated the other aspects of Total Defence. The [[Gurkha Contingent]], which is part of the [[Singapore Police Force]], is also a [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] force. Singapore's defence resources have been used for international [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] aid missions. These missions included [[peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeeping]] abroad in areas such as [[Kosovo]], [[Kuwait]] and [[East Timor]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/peacekeepers/peacekeepers.htm | title=Peacekeepers :: In the Service of Peace | accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref> and participating in the [[multinational force in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Singapore to send 192 military personnel to Iraq  | url = http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031027af.htm  | date = [[October 27]], [[2003]] | publisher = Agence France Presse}}</ref> Before independence, Singapore suffered [[MacDonald House bombing|bomb attack]] during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrantasi campaign]] sponsored by [[Indonesia]] under President [[Sukarno]]. More recent threat comes from the militant organisation [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], which plotted the foiled [[Singapore embassies attack plot|Singapore embassies attack]] in 2001.

== Architecture ==

{{main|Architecture of Singapore}}
The architecture of Singapore is extremely varied and diverse. Due to the lack of available space, few historical buildings remain in the urban areas of Singapore. However, Singapore has become a centre for modern architecture as older buildings are cleared away to make space for newer, larger buildings. Historically, the demand for high-end buildings has been in and around the Central Business District (CBD). After decades of development, the CBD has become an area with many tall business buildings. These buildings comprise the skyline along the coast of Marina Bay and Raffles Place, which is a famous tourist attraction in Singapore. Due to the air restrictions in Singapore, no building in Singapore is to be taller than 280 metres. However, there have been rumours that one of the 3 tallest buildings is 283 metres tall.

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:Sri Mariamman Temple 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Built in 1843, the [[Sri Mariamman Temple]] is the largest Hindu [[temple]] in Singapore. It is also one of the many religious buildings marked as [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monuments]] for their historical value.]]
{{main|Demographics of Singapore|Religion in Singapore}}
Singapore is the [[List of countries by population density|second most densely populated independent country in the world]] excluding Macau and Hong Kong which are parts of PRC. Eighty-four percent of Singaporeans live in public housing provided by the [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB).<ref> {{cite web | title =  Sample Household Survey 2003 | publisher = Housing Development Board | accessdate = 2006-04-14 | url = http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/DA75E3EC5C5D86804825705A00200B3E?OpenDocument }} </ref> Its population of 4.35 million (as of June 2005) is racially diverse. [[Chinese in Singapore|Singaporean Chinese]], the majority, account for 76.8% of Singaporeans. [[Malay Singaporean|Singaporean Malays]], who are the indigenous native group of the country, constitute 13.9%, though this number includes many Malay ethnic groups from other parts of the [[Malay archipelago]] including the [[Javanese]], [[Bugis]], [[Baweans]] and [[Minangkabau]]. [[Indian Singaporean]]s are the third largest ethnic group at 7.9%, consisting of several groups— Indian [[Tamil people|Tamils]] and [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], who form the largest Indian group, and others such as [[Malayali|Malayalees]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and [[Bengal]]is. The rest are made up of smaller groups such as [[Arab Singaporean]]s, Jews, Thais, Japanese, European and the [[Eurasian Singaporean]] community.<ref> {{cite web| title = Key Indicators of Resident Population by Ethnic Group | url = http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/c2000/indicators.pdf | publisher = Singapore Department of Statistics }} </ref>

Singapore is also a multi-religious country, due mainly to its location on one of the world's major transportation routes. More than 40% of Singaporeans profess adherence to [[Buddhism]]. The large percentage may be due to a lack of distinction between Taoism and Buddhism; [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], Buddhism, and ancestral worship are merged into one religion by most of the Chinese population. Most [[Muslim]]s are Malay. [[Christianity]] in Singapore consists of [[Roman Catholicism]] and various [[Protestant]] denominations, and comprises approximately 14% of the population. Other religions include [[Sikhism]], [[Hinduism]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]] followed mainly by those of Indian descent.<ref> {{cite web| title =  Religion, Census 2000 | url = http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/c2000/religion.pdf | publisher = Singapore Department of Statistics }} </ref>

The government of Singapore has been careful to maintain ethnic harmony after [[racial riots of Singapore|racial riots erupted in the 1960s]]. Racial harmony has been emphasized in all aspects of society, including the [[Education in Singapore|Singaporean education system]], military and housing. So far the policy has been largely successful, and there have been few signs of ethnic tension since the early 1970s. Current issues include the ban on wearing [[hijab|the Islamic headscarf]] in public schools. The national language of Singapore is [[Malay language|Malay]] for historical reasons, and it is used in the national anthem, "[[Majulah Singapura]]". The official languages are [[English language|English]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], Malay and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. English has been promoted as the country's language of administration since independence, and it is spoken by the majority of the population. Most public signs and official publication are in English although there are also translated versions in the other official languages. The government has introduced a [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]]- Hua Yu Cool - to promote Mandarin as a common language among the Chinese. <ref> {{cite web| url = http://www.mandarin.org.sg/smc/history.html?pg=8&mlid=8 | title = History & Background | publisher = Speak Mandarin Campaign.}} </ref> 

After two decades of a successful family planning policy, Singapore is now facing the threat of an aging population with declining birth rates. The government is encouraging Singaporeans to have more children through the provision of financial incentives for the first to fourth child of each family.<ref> {{cite web| title = Baby Bonus | url = http://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/menu/bb1.html#ac_parent02 | publisher =  Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports | accessdate = 2006-04-14 }} </ref>

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Singapore}}
[[دوتنه:LavenderFoodSquare-Singapore-20050617-original.jpg|thumb|250px|Enjoying [[Cuisine of Singapore|Singaporean cuisine]] is a national pastime. [[Hawker centre]]s and [[kopi tiam]]s are well-distributed throughout the country.]]
[[دوتنه:CRW_6124.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The majority of Singaporeans live in planned estates of high-rise, high-density [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] [[apartment|flats]].]] 
Singapore is a small and relatively modern amalgam of [[Malays in Singapore|an indigenous Malay]] population with a [[Chinese in Singapore|third generation Chinese]] majority, as well as [[Indian Singaporean|Indian]] and [[Arab Singaporean|Arab]] immigrants with some intermarriages. There also exist [[Eurasian Singaporean|Eurasian]] and ''[[Peranakan]]'' (known also as 'Straits Chinese') communities. Singapore has also achieved a significant degree of [[cultural diffusion]] with its unique combination of these ethnic groups, and this has given Singapore a rich mixture of diversity for its young age. One of the prime examples is in [[Cuisine of Singapore|Singaporean cuisine]], often a cultural attraction for tourists. 

The [[English language|English]] used is primarily [[British English]], with some [[American English]] influences. The local colloquial [[dialect]] of English is [[Singlish]], which has many [[creole language|creole]]-like characteristics, having incorporated vocabulary and grammar from various [[Chinese dialects]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[India]]n languages. Singlish is spoken commonly on the streets, but the government frowns upon its use in official contexts. English became widespread in Singapore after it was implemented as a first language medium in the [[Education in Singapore|education system]], and English is the most common language in [[Literature of Singapore|Singaporean literature]].

Singapore has several ethnic neighbourhoods, including [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] and [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]]. These were formed under the [[Raffles Plan of Singapore|Raffles Plan]] to originally segregate the immigrants, but now have a diverse patronage whose main intentions are to either eat or buy something specific to that culture. Many places of worship were also constructed during the colonial era, a practice encouraged by the British to promote religious tolerance. [[Sri Mariamman Temple]], the [[Masjid Jamae]] [[Mosque]] and the [[Church of Gregory the Illuminator]] are among those that were built during the colonial period. Work is now underway to preserve these religious sites as [[National Monuments of Singapore]]. The policy for the primarily commercial ethnic neighbourhoods stands in contrast to the housing policies of the [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB). HDB policies attempt to promote a mix of all races within each housing district in order to foster social cohesion and national loyalty.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www7.hdb.gov.sg/__48257038002F0DC7.nsf/0/77A56E2D21B93381482571470038C2DC?Open | title=Ethnic Group Eligibility, Housing Development Board InfoWEB | accessdate=2006-04-30}}</ref>

Since the 1990s, the government has been striving to promote Singapore as a centre for arts and culture, including theatre and music, and to transform the country into a [[cosmopolitan]] and diverse community at the 'gateway between the East and West'.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.mica.gov.sg/renaissance/FinalRen.pdf | title=Renaissance City Report: Culture and the Arts in Renaissance Singapore (Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts) | accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref> The highlight of these efforts was the construction of [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay]], a centre for performing arts that opened on October 12, 2002. <ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/Singapore/Singapore-1495679/Things_To_Do-Singapore-Esplanade_Theatres_by_the_Bay-BR-1.html | title=Virtual Tourist: Reviews of Esplanade (Theatres by the Bay) | accessdate=2006-03-28}}</ref>{{-}}

== Education ==
{{main|Education in Singapore}}
[[دوتنه:Nh-students.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Students having assembly in the hall of a Singapore [[Education in Singapore#Secondary education|secondary school]].]]

[[primary education|Primary]] education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in Singapore and as such the literacy rate is 95%.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/annual/sib/sib2006.pdf | title=Singapore in Brief 2006, Singapore Department of Statistics | accessdate=2006-05-01 | format=PDF}}</ref>. The standard for the school curriculum is set by the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] with a mix of [[private school]]s and [[public school]]s. There is no strict public-private dichotomy: the degree of autonomy in regard to the curriculum and student admission, [[corporate welfare|government funding received]], and [[tuition]] burden upon the students is determined by a more specific classification system that includes classifications such as "government-run", "government-aided", "autonomous", "independent", and "privately-funded". <ref> {{cite web | url= http://www.moe.gov.sg/corporate/secondary_02.htm | title=Education System:Secondary | accessdate=2006-05-01 }}</ref> Some schools have more than one classification.  

The education is rigorous and specialised, and has attracted many international scholars. After primary education, students take the [[Primary School Leaving Examination]] (PSLE). Their performance in the examination is the main criteria in determining whether they enter their desired secondary schools. 

Some parents have criticised the system as rigid and promoting [[rote learning]] through its prominent use of large examinations to judge ability. There have also been complaints about excessive [[academic elitism|educational streaming]] at a young age; a popular local film, ''[[I Not Stupid]]'', highlights the competitiveness of the system and social stigma that students struggling with studies have to face. After secondary education, a further set of examinations are taken which determine which kind of [[Post-secondary education|tertiary education]] they pursue, such as [[junior college]], a precursor for entry into public universities such as [[National University of Singapore]] and [[Nanyang Technological University]]. Other post-secondary institutions include [[polytechnic]]s or [[vocational education]] institutes such as the [[Institute of Technical Education]] (ITE).

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Singapore}}

Singapore is a major Asian transportation hub, strategically lying on major sea and air trade routes. Its history has been closely tied to the growth of its transportation industry since the establishment of its port. The transportation industry comprises over 10% of Singaporean GDP despite an increasingly diversified economy. The [[Port of Singapore]], managed by port operators [[PSA International]] and [[Jurong Port]], was the world's busiest port in 2005 in terms of shipping tonnage handled with 1.15 billion [[gross ton]]s handled, and in terms of [[container (cargo)|containerised]] traffic, with 23.2 million [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s (TEUs) handled. It was also the world's second busiest in terms of cargo tonnage, coming behind [[Shanghai]] with 423 million tons handled. In addition, Singapore is the world's busiest hub for transhipment traffic and the world's biggest ship refuelling hub.<ref> {{cite news | title = Singapore remains world's busiest port | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/12/content_4045562.htm | date = 12 January 2006 | publisher = Xinhuanet }} </ref>

Singapore is a major aviation hub and an important stopover point for the '[[Kangaroo route]]' between [[Australasia]] and [[Europe]]. [[Singapore Changi Airport]] has a network of 81 airlines connecting Singapore to 179 cities in 57 countries (2005). It is one of the top five airports in Asia in terms of passengers handled, with 30 million passengers passing through in 2004. It has been consistently rated as one of the best international airports by numerous international travel magazines. It was also rated as the world's best airport in year 2006 by [[Skytrax]], defeating its long time rival, [[Hong Kong International Airport]].<ref> {{cite web | title =2006 Airport of the Year result | accessdate=2006-06-01 | url = http://www.worldairportawards.com/Awards-2006/AirportYear-2006.htm }} </ref> A low-cost terminal, the Budget Terminal, which started operation in March 2006<ref> {{cite news | title =  Singapore opens budget air terminal  | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/199976/1/.html | date = 26 March 2006 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia }} </ref> and a third passenger terminal now under construction will increase the airport's total annual capacity to 66.7 million passengers by 2008. The national carrier [[Singapore Airlines]] (SIA) is internationally renowned for its service and will be the first airline in the world to fly the new [[Airbus A380]] commercially.  

The backbone of domestic transport infrastructure is the [[road transport in Singapore|road transport system]] which includes a [[expressways of Singapore|network of expressways]] that form the arteries between distinct towns and [[regional centre (Singapore)|regional centres]] as laid out in [[urban planning in Singapore|Singapore's urban planning]]. Following a government study assisted by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] which foresaw problems with private transport such as [[traffic congestion]] and [[air pollution]] as the city grew, <ref> {{cite paper | url = http://csur.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ws2004/papers/B2-Fwa.pdf | author = Tien Fang Fwa | title = SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT — Issues and Challenges for Singapore | date = [[September 4|4 September]] [[2004]] | accessdate= 2006-05-01 |publisher = [[University of Tokyo]] }} </ref> the Land Transport Authority began a series of measures to develop the use of the [[public transport in Singapore|public transport system]] such as improving the [[Bus transport in Singapore|nation's bus service]] and liberalising the hired vehicle market to allow for more taxi operators. Since 1987, the heavy rail passenger [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) [[metro]] system has been in operation. MRT was later augmented by and linked to the [[Light Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Light Rapid Transit]] (LRT) [[light rail]] system, which provides service to several expanses of housing estates. The [[EZ-Link]] system allows contactless [[Smart card|smartcards]] to serve as stored value tickets for use in the public transport systems. More than 2.8 million people use the bus network daily, while more than 1.3 million people use either the LRT or MRT as part of their daily routine. <ref name="dailyridership"/> Approximately 900,000 people use the taxi services daily. Private vehicle use in the Central Area is discouraged by tolls implemented through an [[Electronic Road Pricing]] system which operates during hours of heavy road traffic.
