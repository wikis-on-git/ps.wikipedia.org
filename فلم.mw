د افغانستان لومړی فلم نژدې هماغه وخت جوړ شو کوم وخت چې د هندوستان لومړی فلم جوړ شوی وه. لومړنی پښتو افغاني فلم د "عشق او دوستي" په نامه وه. دا فلم هغه وخت جوړ شوی وه په کوم وخت کې چې لا پاکستان نه و جوړ شوی. پدې توګه د افغانستان د فلم تاريخ له نيمې پېړۍ نه هم ډېر زوړ تاريخ لري. همدا لومړنی فلم "عشق او دوستي"، د فلم جوړولو يوې وړې ډلګۍ جوړ کړی وه، دا ډلګۍ   
Afghan Movies are more than half a century old. The first Afghan Movie “Eshq wa Dosti” was produced by a small film industry, which was responsible for producing only short, black and white films and documentaries. It was later in 1965 that the first Afghan movie industry, which started producing movies, was established in Kabul, the capital. 

The Afghan people were greatly familiar with the movies imported from abroad especially India. The Afghan Movies were not very well accepted by the Afghan people. The Afghan film industry faced a lot of technical and economical challenges, yet the producers and staff at the Afghan Film Industry managed to start producing movies. One of the reasons for this enthusiasm and aspiration was the underlying desire and need to be recognized and identified as an independent nation and country worldwide. 

Soon enough, the Afghan Movies caught the interest of the Afghan people, which had been missed out at the beginning. This was a successful step towards attracting more people into watching Afghani Movies. 

Unfortunately Afghanistan has been deeply caught up in many political crises and these crises have not only struck the ancient history of Afghanistan, or the people of Aghanistan, but it has also had effects on the Afghan Movies. Strict laws were made and enforced on filmmaking by the then government of Afghansitan. The films were considered as just a means to just air their political views and further the government’s purposes and policies. The government used the Afghani Movies as a tool to propagate its own political views and beliefs. The Afghani Movies that were made at that time were a strong echo of the government’s political interests.
