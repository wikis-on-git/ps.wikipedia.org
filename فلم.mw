Films are produced by [[recording]] actual people and objects with [[camera]]s, or by creating them using [[animation]] techniques and/or [[special effect]]s. They comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown rapidly in succession, the illusion of motion is given to the viewer. Flickering between frames is not seen due to an effect known as [[persistence of vision]] — whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion — a psychological effect identified as [[beta movement]].

Film is considered by many to be an important [[art]] form; films entertain, educate, enlighten and inspire audiences. The visual elements of cinema need no translation, giving the motion picture a universal power of communication. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of [[dubbing]] or [[subtitle]]s that translate the dialogue. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.

== د فلم تاريخ ==
{{main|د فلمونو تاريخ}}
Mechanisms for producing artificially created, two-dimensional images in motion were demonstrated as early as the 1860s, with devices such as the [[zoetrope]] and the [[praxinoscope]].  These machines were outgrowths of simple optical devices (such as [[magic lantern]]s), and would display sequences of still pictures at sufficient speed for the images on the pictures to appear to be moving, a phenomenon called [[persistence of vision]]. Naturally, the images needed to be carefully designed to achieve the desired effect — and the underlying principle became the basis for the development of film [[animation]].

With the development of [[celluloid]] film for still [[photography]], it became possible to directly capture objects in motion in real time. Early versions of the technology sometimes required the viewer to look into a special device to see the pictures.  By the 1880s, the development of the [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]] allowed the individual component images to be captured and stored on a single [[reel]], and led quickly to the development of a [[movie projector|motion picture projector]] to shine light through the processed and printed film and magnify these "moving picture shows" onto a screen for an entire audience. These reels, so exhibited, came to be known as "motion pictures". Early motion pictures were static [[Shot (film)|shots]] that showed an event or action with no [[Film editing|editing]] or other cinematic techniques.

[[دوتنه:Voyage dans la lune (1902) still03.jpg|thumb|200px|A shot from Georges Méliès' ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune]] (A Trip to the Moon)'' (1902), an early narrative film.]]

Motion pictures were purely [[visual arts|visual art]] up to the late 1920s, but these innovative [[silent film]]s had gained a hold on the public imagination. Around the turn of the 20th Century, films began developing a narrative structure. Films began stringing [[Scene (film)|scenes]] together to tell [[narrative]]s. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots of varying sizes and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were realized as effective ways to portray a story on film. Rather than leave the audience in silence, theater owners would hire a [[piano|pianist]] or [[organ (music)|organist]] or a full [[orchestra]] to play music fitting the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music for this purposes, with complete [[film score]]s being composed for major productions.

The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the breakout of World War I while the film industry in United States flourished with the rise of [[Hollywood]]. However in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] continued to advance the medium. In the 1920s, new technology allowed filmmakers to attach to each film a [[soundtrack]] of speech, music and [[sound effects]] synchronized with the action on the screen. These [[sound film]]s were initially distinguished by calling them "talking pictures", or ''talkies''.

The next major step in the development of cinema was the introduction of [[color]].  While the addition of [[sound]] quickly eclipsed silent film and theater musicians, color was adopted more gradually. The public was relatively indifferent to color photography as opposed to black-and-white. But as color processes improved and became as affordable as [[black-and-white]] film, more and more movies were filmed in color after the end of World War II, as the industry in America came to view color an essential to attracting audiences in its competition with television, which remained a black-and-white medium until the mid-60s. By the end of the 1960s, color had become the norm for film makers.

The 1950s, 60s and 70s saw changes in the production and style of film. [[New Hollywood]], [[French New Wave]] and the rise of film school educated, independent filmmakers were all part of the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th Century. Digital technology has been the driving force in change throughout the 1990s and into the 21st Century.

== Film theory ==
{{main|Film theory}}

Film theory seeks to develop concise, systematic concepts that apply to the study of film/cinema as [[art]]. Classical film theory provides a structural framework to address classical issues of techniques, [[narrativity]], [[diegesis]], cinematic codes, "the image", [[genre]], subjectivity, and authorship. More recent analysis has given rise to  psychoanalytical film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory and others..

{{main|Film industry}}
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon the process was invented.  Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the Lumieres quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses.  In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and  photograph, export, import and screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau Passion play of 1898 was the first commercial motion picture ever produced.  Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world.  Dedicated [[movie theater|theaters]] and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major [[celebrity|celebrities]] and commanded huge fees for their performances.  Already by [[1917]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars.

In the United States today, much of the film industry is centered around [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, and the [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]] (primarily centered around "[[Bollywood]]") annually produces the largest number of films in the world.  Whether the ten thousand plus features a year produced by the [[San Fernando Valley|Valley]] [[pornography|porn]] industry should qualify for this title is the source of some debate.  Though the expense involved in making movies has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of [[movie studio]]s, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.

Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly nature of filmmaking; yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance.  The [[Academy Award]]s (also known as '''The Oscars''') are the most prominent film awards in the [[United States]], providing recognition each year to films, ostensibly based on their artistic merits.  Also, film quickly came to be used in education, in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts.

{{main|Filmmaking}}

The nature of the film determines the size and type of crew required during filmmaking. Many [[Hollywood]] [[adventure film]]s need [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI), created by dozens of [[3D modelling|3D modellers]], [[animation|animators]], rotoscopers and compositors. However, a low-budget, independent film may be made with a skeleton crew, often paid very little. Filmmaking takes place all over the world using different technologies, styles of acting and genre, and is produced in a variety of economic contexts that range from state-sponsored documentary in China to profit-oriented movie making within the American [[studio system]].

A typical Hollywood-style filmmaking [[Production cycle]] comprises five main stages: 

# Development
# Preproduction
# Production
# Post-production
# Distribution

This production cycle typically takes three years. The first year is taken up with ''development''. The second year comprises ''preproduction'' and ''production''. The third year, ''post-production'' and ''distribution''.

{{main|Film crew}}

A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. ''Crew'' are distinguished from ''cast'', the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film.

== خپلواک فلم جوړونه ==
{{main|Independent film}}

Independent filmmaking takes place outside of the Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century]].  

Creatively, it was becoming increasingly difficult to get studio backing for experimental films.  Experimental elements in theme and style are inhibitors for the big studios.

On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also leads to conservative choices in cast and crew.  The problem is exacerbated by the trend towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by [[Warner Bros.]] in [[2000]] were joint ventures, up from 10% in [[1987]]). An unproven director is almost never given the opportunity to get his or her big break with the studios unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television.  They also rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.

Until the advent of [[digital film|digital]] alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film.  The cost of [[35mm film]] is outpacing inflation: in [[2002]] alone, film negative costs were up 23%, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.  Film requires expensive lighting and [[post-production]] facilities.

But the advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in [[1985]], and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution [[digital video]] in the early [[1990s]], have lowered the technology barrier to movie production significantly.  Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; today, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based [[personal computer]].  Technologies such as [[DVD]]s, [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]] connections and [[non-linear editing system]] pro-level software like [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] and [[Final Cut Pro]], and consumer level software such as [[Final Cut Express]] and [[iMovie]] make movie-making relatively inexpensive.

Since the introduction of [[DV]] technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a movie, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution.

== Animation ==
{{main|Animation}}

Animation is the technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the [[persistence of vision]]). Generating such a film is very labour intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process.

[[Graphics file format]]s like [[GIF]], [[MNG]], [[SVG]] and [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the Internet.

Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and movies comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the [[1950s]], with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized (some say exploited) by [[Hanna-Barbera]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].

== Film venues ==
When it is initially produced, a film is normally shown to audiences in a [[movie theater]]. The first theater designed exclusively for cinema opened in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in [[1905]]. Thousands of such theaters were built or converted from existing facilities within a few years.  In the [[United States]], these theaters came to be known as [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeons]], because admission typically cost a nickel (five cents).

Typically, one film is the featured presentation (or [[feature film]]).  There were "double features"; typically, a high quality "A picture" rented by an independent theater for a lump sum, and a "B picture" of lower quality rented for a percentage of the gross receipts. Today, the bulk of the material shown before the feature film (those in theaters) consists of previews for upcoming movies and paid advertisements (also known as [[trailer (movie)|trailers]] or "[[The Twenty]]").

Originally, all films were made to be shown in movie theaters. The development of [[television]] has allowed films to be broadcast to larger audiences, usually after the film is no longer being shown in theaters. Recording technology has also enabled consumers to rent or buy copies of films on [[video tape]] or [[DVD]] (and the older formats of [[laserdisc]], [[Video CD|VCD]] and [[SelectaVision]]—see also [[videodisc]]), and [[Internet]] [[download]]s may be available and have started to become revenue sources for the film companies. Some films are now made specifically for these other venues, being released as [[television movie|made-for-TV movies]] or [[direct-to-video]] movies. These are often considered to be of inferior quality compared to theatrical releases. And indeed, some films that are rejected by their own studios upon completion are dumped into these markets.

The movie theater pays an average of about 55% of its ticket sales to the [[movie studio]], as film rental fees. The actual percentage starts with a number higher than that, and decreases as the duration of a film's showing continues, as an incentive to theaters to keep movies in the theater longer. However, today's barrage of highly marketed movies ensures that most movies are shown in first-run theaters for less than 8 weeks. There are a few movies every year that defy this rule, often limited-release movies that start in only a few theaters and actually grow their theater count through good word-of-mouth and reviews.  According to a 2000 study by [[ABN AMRO]], about 26% of Hollywood movie studios' worldwide income came from box office ticket sales; 46% came from [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] sales to consumers; and 28% came from television (broadcast, cable, and pay-per-view).

== د فلمي تخنيک پرمختګ ==
[[film stock|Filmstock]] consists of a transparent [[celluloid]], [[polyester]], or other [[plastic]] base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials.  Stock widths and the [[film format]] for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as [[35 mm film|35 mm]] prints.

Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked [[movie camera|cameras]] and [[movie projector|projectors]]; though 16 frames per second is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16-23 fps and projected from 18 fps on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown) [http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm]. When sound film was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second was chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late [[19th century]] include the mechanization of cameras - allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design - allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated [[film stock|filmstocks]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], allowing [[Film director|directors]] to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action.  The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.

As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for [[photography]]. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow.  Film has also been incorporated into [[multimedia]] presentations, and often has importance as primary historical documentation.  However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most movies on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of [[separation masters]] - three B&W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the [[Technicolor]] process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. [[Film preservation]] of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists, and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher-concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black and white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.

Some films in recent decades have been recorded using [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[video]] technology similar to that used in television production.  Modern [[Digital video|digital video cameras]] and [[digital projector]]s are gaining ground as well.  These approaches are extremely beneficial to moviemakers, especially because footage can be evaluated and edited without waiting for the film stock to be processed.  Yet the migration is gradual, and as of 2005 most major motion pictures are still recorded on film.

== Endurance of films ==
Films have been around for more than a century, however this is not long when one considers it in relation to other arts like painting and sculpture.  Many believe that film will be a long enduring art form because motion pictures appeal to diverse human emotions.

Apart from societal norms and cultural changes, there are still close resemblances between theatrical plays throughout the ages and films of today. Romantic motion pictures about a girl loving a guy but not being able to be together for some reason, movies about a hero who fights against all odds a more powerful fiendish enemy, comedies about everyday life, etc. all involve plots with common threads that existed in books, plays and other venues.

The reason motion pictures endure is because people still want [[escapism]], adventure, inspiration, humor and to be moved emotionally. Civilization develops and changes, at least in surface features, and so calls for a constant renewal of artistic means to channel these desires. Films provide them in an accessible and powerful way.

Soon enough, the Afghan Movies caught the interest of the Afghan people, which had been missed out at the beginning. This was a successful step towards attracting more people into watching Afghani Movies. 

Unfortunately Afghanistan has been deeply caught up in many political crises and these crises have not only struck the ancient history of Afghanistan, or the people of Aghanistan, but it has also had effects on the Afghan Movies. Strict laws were made and enforced on filmmaking by the then government of Afghansitan. The films were considered as just a means to just air their political views and further the government’s purposes and policies. The government used the Afghani Movies as a tool to propagate its own political views and beliefs. The Afghani Movies that were made at that time were a strong echo of the government’s political interests.
