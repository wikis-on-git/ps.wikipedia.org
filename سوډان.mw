'''سوډان''' (په انګرېزۍ کې Republic of Sudan)د مساحت له مخې د [[افريقا]] تر ټولو لوى هېواد دى. شمال ته يې سور سمندرګى، شمال ختيځ ته يې [[مصر]] پروت دى چې پلازمېنه يې خرطوم دى او جنوب ختيځ ته يې د کانګو جمهوريت، يوګانادا او کېنيا پراته دي. ختيځ ته يې [[اېتوپيا]] او [[اېرېتېريا]] واقع دي، لوېديځ ته يې [[ليبيا]] او [[چاډ]] پراته دي.
, [[چاډ]] to the west, and [[ليبيا]] to the northwest.

In recent years, the [[definite article]] in the country's name has increasingly been dropped in common usage; i.e., it would be referred to as "Sudan" rather than "the Sudan."

Sudan is one of the world's most bitterly divided countries. Most people in the richer northern region of the country are [[Muslims]], and the rest living in the poorer southern region are mostly non-Muslims. These cultural differences together with other social, economic, and political factors have plunged Sudan into one of the most violent [[civil war]]s in modern history.

{{main|د سوډان تاريخ}}
[[دوتنه:Sudan n3.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of a Nubian king, Sudan]]

=== Early History of Sudan ===
{{main| Early history of Sudan}}
{{sect-stub}}
Three ancient [[Kush]]ite kingdoms existed consecutively in northern Sudan. This region was also known as Nubia and [[Meroe]], and these civilizations flourished mainly along the Nile River from the first to the sixth cataracts. The kingdoms were influenced by, and in turn influenced [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]]. In ancient times, Nubia was ruled by Egypt from 2600 BC, although borders fluctuated greatly.

[[Christianity]] was introduced by missionaries in the 3rd or 4th century, and much of the region was converted to [[Coptic Christianity]]. [[Islam]] was introduced in 640AD with an influx of Muslim Arabs who had conquered Egypt, although the Christian Kingdoms of [[Nubia]] managed to persist until the 15th Century.

A merchant class of [[Arab]]s became economically dominant in [[Feudalism|feudal]] Sudan. An important kingdom in Nubia was the [[Makuria]], which reached its height in the 8th-9th centuries, and was of the [[Melkite]] Christian faith, unlike its Coptic neighbours, [[Nobatia]] and [[Alodia]].

=== Kingdom of Sennar ===
{{main|Kingdom of Sennar}}
During the 1500s peoples called the [[Funj]] conquered much of Sudan, establishing the [[Kingdom of Sennar]]. By the time the kingdom was conquered by Egypt in 1820, the government was substantially weakened by a series of succession arguments and coups within the royal family.

=== Foreign Control: Egyptian and British ===
In 1820, Northern Sudan came under Egyptian rule when [[Mehemet Ali]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]] of [[Egypt]], sent armies led by his son [[Ismail Pasha]] and [[Mahommed Bey]] to conquer eastern Sudan. The Egyptians developed Sudan’s trade in ivory and slaves.

[[Ismail Pasha]], [[khedive]] of [[Egypt]] from 1863-1879, tried to extend Egyptian influence south to end the slave trade. This led to a revolt led by religious leader [[Muhammad ibn Abdalla]], the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] ([[Messiah]]), who sought to purify Islam in Sudan. He led a nationalist revolt against Egyptian rule culminating in the fall of [[Khartoum]] in 1885. The revolt was successful and Egypt abandoned Sudan, and the resulting state was a theocratic Mahdist state.

In the 1890s the British sought to gain control of Sudan. [[Horatio Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] led military campaigns from 1896-98. An agreement was reached in 1899 establishing Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, under which Sudan was run by a governer-general appointed by Egypt with British consent. In reality, Sudan was a colony of Great Britain.

From 1924, until independence in 1956, the British had a policy of running Sudan as two essentially separate colonies, the south and the north.

=== خپلواکي ===
{{sect-stub}}
Sudan became independent in 1956. Britain agreed to Sudanese independence after the 1952 revolution in Egypt; the government that came to power in Egypt in 1952 supported a plebiscite on independence.

=== First Sudanese Civil War ===
{{main| First Sudanese Civil War}}
The year before independence on [[January 1]], [[1956]], a [[civil war]] began between Northern and Southern Sudan. Southerners, who knew independence was coming, were afraid the new nation would be dominated by the North.

The North of Sudan had historically closer ties with Egypt and was predominately Arab and [[Muslim]]. The South of Sudan was predominately black, with a mixture of [[Christianity]] and [[Animism]]. These divisions had been further emphasized by the British policy of ruling Sudan’s North and South administratively separately. From 1924 it was illegal for people living above the 10th parallel to go further south, and people below the 8th parallel to go further north. The law was enacted to prevent the spread of [[malaria]] and other [[tropical diseases]] that had ravaged British troops. However, it resulted in isolation between the already distinct north and south.

The resulting conflict was known as the [[First Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] and lasted from 1955 to 1972. In 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north-south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to a ten-year hiatus in the civil war. Under the [[Addis Ababa Agreement]] Southern Sudan was given considerable [[autonomy]].

=== Second Sudanese Civil War ===
{{main|Second Sudanese Civil War}}
In 1983 the civil war was reignited following President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]]’s decision to circumvent the [[Addis Ababa Agreement]]. President Gaafar Nimeiry attempted to create a Federated Sudan including states in Southern Sudan, which violated the Addis Ababa Agreement which had granted the South considerable autonomy. The [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] formed in May 1983 as a result. Finally, in June 1983, the Sudanese Government under President Gaafar Nimeiry abrogated the Addis Ababa Peace Agreement[http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/anctoday/2005/at31.htm]. The situation was exacerbated after President Gaafar Nimeiry went on to implement [[Sharia Law]] in September of the same year [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13409.html].

The civil war went for more than 20 years, resulting in the deaths of 2.2 million [[Christians]] and [[Animists]], and displacing roughly 4.5 million people within Sudan and into neighbouring countries. It damaged Sudan’s economy and led to food shortages, resulting in starvation and malnutrition. The lack of investment during this time, particularly in the south, meant a generation lost access to basic health services, education, and jobs.

Peace talks between the southern rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004. The peace was consolidated with the official signing by both sides of the Naivasha treaty on [[9 January]] [[2005]], granting [[Southern Sudan]] autonomy for six years, to be followed by a referendum about independence. It created a co-vice president position and allowed the north and south to split oil equally, but also left both the North's and South's armies in place. [[John Garang]], the south's elected co-vice president died in a helicopter crash on August 1, 2005, three weeks after being sworn in. This resulted in riots, but the peace was eventually able to continue.

=== Darfur Conflict ===
[[دوتنه:Darfur map.png|framed|Map of Darfur]]
{{main|Darfur conflict}}

Just as the decades long North-South civil war was reaching a resolution, a new rebellion in the western region of [[Darfur]] began in early 2003. The rebels accused the central government of neglecting the Darfur region, although there is uncertainty regarding the objectives of the rebels and whether they merely seek an improved position for Darfur within Sudan or outright secession. Both the government and the rebels have been accused of atrocities in this war, although most of the blame has fallen on Arab militias ([[Janjaweed]]) allied with the government. The rebels have alleged that these militias have been engaging in [[ethnic cleansing]] in Darfur, and the fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them seeking refuge in neighboring Chad. The government claimed victory over the rebels after capturing [[Tine (Sudan)|Tine]], a town on the border with Chad, in early 2004 the violence continued. But as of 2006, the War in Darfur has ended and the [[Janjaweed]] are being disarmed and banished from the military. Many leading business people now see a great potential in Sudan's economy, and [[UN]] [[Sanctions]] may be lifted soon; however, violence continues.

The [[United Nations Mission In Sudan|United Nations Mission in Sudan]] (UNMIS) was established under UN Security Council Resolution 1590 of March 24, 2005.  Its mandate is to support implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and to perform functions relating to humanitarian assistance, and protection and promotion of human rights.

The people in Darfur are predominately black and Muslim, whereas Janjaweed militias are Arab Muslims.

=== Chad-Sudan conflict ===
{{main|Chad-Sudan conflict}}
The [[Chad-Sudan conflict]] officially started on [[December 23]], [[2005]], when the [[Politics of Chad|government of Chad]] declared a [[state of war]] with Sudan and called for the citizens of [[Chad]] to mobilize themselves against the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556576.stm "common enemy,"]
which the Chadian government sees as the [[Rally for Democracy and Liberty]] (RDL) militants, Chadian rebels backed by the [[Sudanese]] government, and Sudanese militiamen. Militants have attacked villages and towns in eastern Chad, stealing cattle, murdering citizens, and burning houses. Over 200,000 refugees from the [[Darfur]] region of northwestern Sudan currently claim asylum in eastern Chad. Chadian president [[Idriss Déby]] accuses Sudanese President [[Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir]] of trying to "destabilize our country, to drive our people into misery, to create disorder and export the war from Darfur to Chad."

The incident prompting the declaration of war was an attack on the Chadian town of [[Adré]] near the Sudanese border that led to the deaths of either one hundred rebels (as most news sources reported) or three hundred rebels. The Sudanese government was blamed for the attack, which was the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4544352.stm second in the region in three days], but Sudanese foreign ministry spokesman [[Jamal Mohammed Ibrahim]] denied any Sudanese involvement, "We are not for any escalation with Chad. We technically deny involvement in Chadian internal affairs." The Adre attack led to the declaration of war by Chad and the alleged deployment of the [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AB24F0A9-8145-4E1E-96C7-3D8FC9641CC6.htm Chadian airforce into Sudanese airspace, which the Chadian government denies].

<!-- In [[1991]], [[Osama Bin Laden]] moved to Sudan. His stated objective was to use his money, power and expertise in construction to help Sudan. He was attracted to Sudan because it claimed to be a purely Islamic state. He was responsible for building the road from Khartoum northward to the town of [[Shendi]]. He is purported to have lost much money on business [[venture]]s in Sudan; some estimates exceed $100 million [[USD]] [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/bio2.html]. In place of payment for his road venture, the Government of Sudan, strapped for cash, paid him with a defunct tanning factory, which in 1996 was confiscated when he was forcebly expelled at the request of the [[United States]] and he relocated to [[Afghanistan]].-->

Sudan has an authoritarian government in which all effective political power is in the hands of President Umar Hassan al-Bashir. Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on [[30 June]] [[1989]].

From 1983 to 1997, the country was divided into five regions in the north and three in the south, each headed by a military governor. After the [[April 6]], [[1985]] military coup, regional assemblies were suspended. The RCC was abolished in 1996, and the ruling [[National Islamic Front]] changed its name to the [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]]. After 1997, the structure of regional administration was replaced by the creation of 26 states. The executives, cabinets, and senior-level state officials are appointed by the president, and their limited budgets are determined by and dispensed from Khartoum. The states, as a result, remain economically dependent upon the central government. [[Khartoum (state)|Khartoum state]], comprising the capital and outlying districts, is administered by a governor.

In December 1999, a power struggle climaxed between President al-Bashir and then-[[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of parliament [[Hassan al-Turabi]], who was the NIF founder and an Islamist ideologue. Al-Turabi was stripped of his posts in the ruling party and the government, parliament was disbanded, the constitution was suspended, and a state of national emergency was declared by presidential decree. Parliament resumed in February 2001 after the December 2000 presidential and parliamentary elections, but the national emergency laws remain in effect. Al-Turabi was arrested in February 2001, and charged with being a threat to national security and the constitutional order for signing a memorandum of understanding with the [[SPLA]]. Since then his outspoken style has had him in prison or under house-arrest, his most recent stint beginning in March of 2004 and ending in June of 2005. During that time he was under house-arrest for his role in a failed coup attempt in September of 2003, an allegation he has denied. According to some reports, the president had no choice but to release him, given that a coalition of National Democratic Union (NDA) members headquartered in both Cairo and Eritrea, composed of the political parites known as the SPLM/A, Umma Party, Mirghani Party, and Turabi's own National People's Congress, were calling for his release at a time when an interim government was preparing to take over in accordance with the Naivasha agreement and the Machokos Accord.

Sudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbors and much of the international community due to what is viewed as its aggressively Islamic stance. For much of the 1990s, [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] formed an ad-hoc alliance called the "Front Line States" with support from the [[United States]] to check the influence of the [[National Islamic Front]] government. During this period, Sudan supported anti-Uganda rebel groups such as the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] in retaliation for Ugandan support of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]. Beginning from the mid-1990s Sudan gradually began to moderate its positions as a result of increased US pressure following the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] and the new development of oil fields previously in rebel hands. Sudan also has a territorial dispute with Egypt over the [[Hala'ib Triangle]]. Since 2003, the foreign relations of Sudan have centered on the support for ending the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and condemnation of government support for militias in the [[Darfur conflict]].

On [[December 23]], [[2005]] [[Chad]], Sudan's neighbor to the west, declared war on Sudan and accused the country of being the "common enemy of the nation (Chad)." This happened after the [[December 18]] attack on [[Adre]], which left about 100 people dead. A statement issued by Chadian government on [[December 23]], accused Sudanese militias of making daily incursions into Chad, stealing cattle, killing innocent people and burning villages on the Chadian border. The statement went on to call for Chadians to form a patriotic front against Sudan.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556576.stm] The [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]](OIC) have called on Sudan and Chad to exercise self-restraint to defuse growing tensions between the two countries.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4559254.stm]

On December 27, 2005, Sudan became one of the few [[state]]s to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over [[Western Sahara]]. [http://www.moroccotimes.com/paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=11765]

As of 2006, Sudan remains one of the few nations not to have diplomatic relations with the United States.

On June 20, 2006 President Omar al-Bashir told reporters that he would not allow any UN peacekeeping force into Sudan. President al-Bashir denounced any such mission as "colonial forces." [http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/06/20/sudan.darfur.ap/]

Sudan has turned around a struggling economy with sound economic policies and infrastructure investments, but it still faces formidable economic problems, starting from its low level of per capita output. From 1997 to date, Sudan has been implementing IMF macroeconomic reforms. In 1999, Sudan began exporting crude oil and in the last quarter of 1999 recorded its first trade surplus, which, along with monetary policy, has stabilized the exchange rate. Increased oil production, revived light industry, and expanded export processing zones helped sustain GDP growth at 6.1% in 2003.

Agriculture production remains Sudan's most important sector, employing 80% of the work force and contributing 39% of GDP, but most farms remain rain-fed and susceptible to drought. Chronic instability - including the long-standing civil war between the Muslim north and the Christian/animist south, adverse weather, and weak world agricultural prices - ensure that much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Sudan|Social order of Sudan}}
In Sudan’s 1993 census, the population was calculated at 25 million. No comprehensive [[census]] has been carried out since that time due to the continuation of the civil war. Current estimates from the [[United Nations]] as of 2006 estimate the [[population]] to be about 37 million. The population of metropolitan Khartoum (including Khartoum, Omdurman, and Khartoum North) is growing rapidly and is estimated at about 5-6 million, including around 2 million displaced persons from the southern war zone as well as western and eastern drought-affected areas.

Sudan has two distinct major cultures--Arabs with Nubian (Kushite) roots and non-Arab Black Africans--with hundreds of ethnic and tribal divisions and language groups, which makes effective collaboration among them a major problem.

The northern states cover most of the Sudan and include most of the urban centers. Most of the 22 million Sudanese who live in this region are Arabic-speaking Muslims, though the majority also use a traditional non-Arabic mother tongue--e.g., Nubian, Beja, Fur, Nuban, Ingessana, etc. Among these are several distinct tribal groups: the Kababish of northern Kordofan, a camel-raising people; the Ga’alin (الجعلين), Rubatab (الرباطاب), [[Manasir]] (المناصير) and Shaiqiyah (الشايقيّة) of the tribes settling along the rivers; the seminomadic Baggara of [[Kurdufan]] and [[Darfur]]; the [[Beja people|Beja]] in the Red Sea area and Nubians of the northern Nile areas, some of whom have been resettled on the Atbara River. Shokrya in the [[Butana]] land, Bataheen bordering the Ga’alin and Shorya in the south west of [[Butana]]. Rufaa, Halaween and many other tripes in the Gazeera region and on the banks of the Blue Nile and the Dindir region. The Nuba of southern Kurdufan and Fur in the western reaches of the country.

The southern region has a population of around 6 million and a predominantly rural, subsistence economy. This region has been negatively affected by war for all but 10 years since independence in 1956, resulting in serious neglect, lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement. More than 2 million people have died, and more than 4 million are internally displaced or have become refugees as a result of the civil war and war-related impacts. Here the Sudanese practice mainly indigenous traditional beliefs, although Christian missionaries have converted some. The south also contains many tribal groups and many more languages are used than in the north. The Dinka--whose population is estimated at more than 1 million--is the largest of the many black African tribes of the Sudan. Along with the Shilluk and the Nuer, they are among the Nilotic tribes. The Azande, Bor, and Jo Luo are “Sudanic” tribes in the west, and the Acholi and Lotuhu live in the extreme south, extending into Uganda.
