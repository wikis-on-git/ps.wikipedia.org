The '''Republic of Honduras''' is a country in [[Central America]], bordered to the west by [[ګواتمالا]], to the south west by [[اېلسلوادور]], to the south east by [[نيکاراګوا]], to the south by the [[Pacific Ocean]], to the north by the [[Gulf of Honduras]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], with [[Belize]] (formerly British Honduras) situated 50 [[mile]]s (75&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) away across the Gulf of Honduras.

== تاريخ ==
''Main articles:[[History of Honduras]],[[Timeline of Honduran history]]''

The Pre-Columbian city of '''Copán''' is a locale in extreme western Honduras, in the Copán [[Department]], near the Guatemalan border. It is the site of a major Maya civilization|Maya kingdom of the Classic era. The ancient kingdom, named ''Xukpi'' (Corner-Bundle), flourished from the 5th century Anno Domini|AD to the early 9th century, with antecedents going back to at least the 2nd century AD. The Maya civilization decayed, and by the time the Spanish came to Honduras, the once great city-state of Copán was overrun by the jungle. 

On his fourth and final voyage to the New World, Columbus reached the coast of Honduras in 1502.  After the Spanish discovery and subsequent conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the Kingdom of Guatemala. The Spanish ruled Honduras for approximately 3 centuries.

Along with Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Costa Rica, Honduras was granted independence from Spain in 1821 as part of the newly declared Mexican Empire of Iturbide.  In 1823 The Central American states split from Mexico under the name of the United Provinces.  The federation of the United Provinces disintegrated in 1838.  The states of the United Provinces became independent nations.

The Football war of 1969 was fought with El Salvador. It lasted approximately 100 hours. During the 1980s, the United States had a large military presence in Honduras with the purpose of creating, training and supporting the anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Nicaraguan government and to support the government of El Salvador forces fighting against the guerrilla warfare|guerrillas trying to oust a long succession of violently repressive military dictatorships, and military backed governments.

Hurricane Fifi caused severe damage while skimming the northern coast of Honduras on September 18 and 19, 1974. Later,
Hurricane Mitch devastated the country and wrecked its economic system|economy in 1998.

''See also: [[Elections in Honduras]] [[President of Honduras]]''

A Presidential and general election was held on [[November 27]], [[2005]]. [[Manuel Zelaya]]  of the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) won  with [[Porfirio Pepe Lobo]] of the [[National Party of Honduras]] (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) coming in second. The PNH challenged the election results, and Lobo Sosa did not concede until December 7.  Towards the end of December the government finally released the total ballot count, giving Zelaya the official victory.  Zelaya was inaugurated as Honduras' new president on [[January 27]], [[2006]].

Honduras has five registered political parties: PNH, PLH, Social Democrats (Partido Innovación Nacional y Social Demócrata: PINU-SD), Social Christians (Partido Demócrata-Cristiano: DC), and Democrat Unification (Partido Unificación Democrática: UD). The PNH and PLH have ruled the country for decades. In the last 23 years, Honduras has had four Liberal presidents: [[Roberto Suazo Córdova]], [[José Azcona del Hoyo]], [[Carlos Roberto Reina]], and [[Carlos Roberto Flores]], and two Nationalists: [[Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero]] and [[Ricardo Maduro]]. The elections have been full of controversies including, questions about whether Azcona was born in Honduras or Spain, and whether Maduro should have been able to stand given he was born in [[Panama]]. 

Honduras is a developing country in Central America.

== Subdivisions ==
''Main articles: [[Departments of Honduras]] and [[Municipalities of Honduras]]''

Honduras is divided into 18 [[department]]s and 298 [[municipality|municipalities]]. The largest department by surface area is [[Olancho department]] and by population is [[Francisco Morazán department]], where the capital city of Tegucigalpa is located, and the smallest by both surface area and population is the [[Islas de la Bahía department]].

== جغرافيه ==
[[دوتنه:Honduras_sm04.png|thumb|200px|right|Map of Honduras]]
Honduras borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] on the north coast and the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the south through the Gulf of Fonseca. The [[climate]] varies from [[tropical]] in the [[lowlands]] to [[temperate]] in the mountains. The central and southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern coast. 

Honduran terrain consists mainly of mountains (~80%), but there are narrow plains along the coasts, a large undeveloped lowland jungle [[La Mosquitia]] region in the northeast and the heavily populated lowland [[San Pedro Sula]] valley in the northwest. In La Mosquitia lies the [[UNESCO]]-protected Biosphere of [[Río Plátano]], with the [[Río Negro (Honduras/Nicaragua)|Río Negro]] dividing the country from [[Nicaragua]]. See [[Rivers of Honduras]].

Natural resources include [[timber]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron]] [[ore]], [[antimony]], [[coal]], [[fish]], and [[hydropower]].

''Main article: [[Economy of Honduras]]''

Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Americas, with GDP per capita at [[United States dollar|US$]]2050 per year (1999).
The economy has continued to grow slowly but the distribution of wealth remains very polarized with average wages remaining very low. Economic growth is roughly 5% a year, but many people remain below the poverty line. It is estimated that there are more than 1.2 million people who are [[Unemployment|unemployed]].

The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] classified Honduras as one of the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] eligible for [[debt relief]], and this debt relief was given in [[2005]].

Both the electricity services (ENEE) and land line telephone services (Hondutel) are run by government monopolies, with the former receiving heavy subsidies from the government because of its chronic financial problems. There are price controls around the price of [[petrol]], and other temporary price controls of basic commodities are often passed for short periods by the [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]].

After years of declining against the US dollar the [[Lempira]] has stabilized at around 19 Lempiras per dollar.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Honduras]]''

The population of Honduras is predominantly of [[Mestizo]] descent and [[Roman Catholic]] faith, but there are also several [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominations. Along the northern coast are communities of English speakers who have maintained their culture since Honduras had some islands and sections along the Caribbean coast were occupied by pirates and by the British at one time or another.  Groups of [[Garífuna]] live along the north coast, where there are also many [[Afro-Latin American]]s. In the 20th century, Garífunas became part of Honduras' projected identity through theatrical presentations such as [[Louvavagu]] in order to help boost [[tourism]]. [[Asian]]s in Honduras are mostly of [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[ethnic Japanese|Japanese]] descent. Hundreds of families can find their roots in [[Lebanon]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in Middle Eastern families called "turcos", because they arrived at the country under turkish identities. The so-called "Turcos" along with the Jewish minority population influence the Honduran economy and politics by having the highest income. Many others have connections to [[Spain]], the [[United States]] (especially [[New Orleans]], [[Florida]] and [[California]]) and the [[Cayman Islands]].
Even with all the "new-comers" in the country, the [[indigenous peoples]] of Honduras are widely scattered throughout the country. Tribes like Chortís (Mayan descent), Payas or Pech, Tolupanes or Xicaques/Jicaques, Lencas, Sumos or Tawahkas, and Miskitos are still present and most conserve their language. For the most part, these tribes live in extreme poverty due to their remote locations and uninterested government.

''Main article: [[Culture of Honduras]]''

The patron saint of Honduras is the [[Virgin of Suyapa]]. 

A Honduran can be called a ''Catracho'' or ''Catracha''. The word is derived from the last name of Honduran General [[Florencio Xatruch]], who led Honduran armed forces in defense of Honduran territories in [[1857]] against an attempted invasion led by North American filibuster [[William Walker (soldier)|William Walker]]. The nickname is considered complimentary, not derogatory.  

One of Honduras' best known writers is [[Ramón Amaya Amador]]. Other writers include [[Roberto Sosa]], [[Eduardo Bähr]], [[Amanda Castro]], [[Javier Abril Espinoza]], and [[Roberto Quesada]].

[[Oscar Andres Rodriguez]] is a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] who was a potential [[papabile|candidate]] for [[Pope]] in the [[Papal conclave, 2005]].

Not as famous as the cardinal, but also noteworthy, is [[Salvador Moncada]], a world-renowned scientist with authorship of more than 12 highly cited papers, including his work on [[nitric oxide]]. His research on heart-related drugs includes the development of Viagra. Moncada works at the [[University College]] of London and funds an NGO in Tegucigalpa.

''[[Honduras This Week]]'' is a weekly [[English language]] [[newspaper]] that has been [[publishing|published]] now for 17 years in Tegucigalpa. On the islands of Roatan, Utila and Guanaja the ''[[Bay Islands Voice]]'' is a source of monthly news since 2003.

The Mesoamerican region is a landmass that extends from Southern Mexico to Panama, considered also as a "biodiversity hotspot" for the numerous species of plants and animals that live there. Like the other countries in the region, Honduras contains vast biological resources and several ethnical groups. This 43,278 [[square mile]] (112,092&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;km) country hosts 6,000-8,000 species of [[vascular plants]], of which 630 -described so far- are Orchids; around 250 reptiles and amphibians, more than 700 bird species, and 110 mammal species, half of them are bat species.

In the northeastern region of [[La Mosquitia]] lies the [[Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve]], a lowland rainforest which provides home to a great diversity of life. Sometimes called "The Last Lungs of Central America", this Reserve was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] Sites List in 1982.
