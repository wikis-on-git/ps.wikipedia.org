'''Manoj Bajpayee''' (born 23 April 1969), also credited as '''Manoj Bajpai''', is an Indian film actor who predominantly works in Hindi cinema and has also done [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] and [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] language films. He is the recipient of two [[National Film Awards (India)|National Film Awards]] and four [[Filmfare Awards]].

Born in Belwa, a small village in Narkatiaganj, Bihar, Bajpayee aspired to become an actor since childhood. He relocated to Delhi at the age of seventeen, and applied for the [[National School of Drama]], only to be rejected four times. He continued to do theatre while studying in college. Bajpayee made his feature film debut with a one-minute role in ''[[Drohkaal]]'' (1994), and a minor role of a dacoit in [[Shekhar Kapur]]'s  ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994). After a few unnoticed roles, he played the gangster Bhiku Mhatre in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s 1998 crime drama ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'', which proved to be a breakthrough. Bajpayee received the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for the film. He then acted in films such as ''[[Kaun (film)|Kaun]]'' (1999) and ''[[Shool]]'' (1999). For the latter, he won his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Bajpayee further played the role of a prince with two wives in ''[[Zubeidaa]]'' (2001), a serial killer in ''[[Aks (2001 film)|Aks]]'' (2001) and a hitchhiker-turned-psychopath killer in ''[[Road (film)|Road]]'' (2002).

Bajpayee won the [[National Film Award – Special Jury Award (Feature Film)|Special Jury National Award]] for ''[[Pinjar (film)|Pinjar]]'' (2003). This was followed by a series of brief, unnoticed roles in films that failed to propel his career forward. He then played a greedy politician in the political thriller ''[[Raajneeti]]'' (2010), which was well received. In 2012, Bajpayee essayed the role of Sardar Khan in ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 1|Gangs of Wasseypur]]''. His next roles were of a [[naxalite]] in ''[[Chakravyuh]]'' (2012), and a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI officer]] in ''[[Special 26]]'' (2013). In 2016, he portrayed professor [[Ramchandra Siras]], in [[Hansal Mehta]]'s biographical drama ''[[Aligarh (film)|Aligarh]]'', for which he won his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and the Best Actor Award at the 2016 [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].
