3. Biodata:
Dawlat Khan Daulat Khan Zadran was born 1964 in Paktika Province. He returned home to Paktika October 2009 after a long exile in Pakistan. Gen. Khan was at school one afternoon in 1979 when he saw Russian tanks moving through the streets of his town, followed by columns of soldiers. His father, Haj Sultan Muhammed, led armed men from his tribe into the local mountains and joined the nascent religious war against the Soviets. During the long war, Gen. Khan moved to Pakistan, where he says he worked to funnel U.S.-donated AK-47s and other weaponry to his father. Gen. Khan won't say how he got the guns. An Afghan official in Kabul who worked with Haji Sultan Muhammed said the weapons were delivered by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Reports claimed military equipment handed over to Afghan forces by the US in Paktika had been sent willfully to Kabul by Brig. Gen. Dawlat Khan Zadran. In response to the report, Zadran said he would appear before the Attorney General (AG) to answer the allegations levelled against him as soon as he returned from medical treatment in India.(20131115)
