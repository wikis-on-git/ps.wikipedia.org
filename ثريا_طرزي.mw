ملکه ثريا طرزي د سردار غلام محمد طرزي لمسۍ او د نامتو افغان لارښود او د افغان ژورناليزم پلار، سردار محمود طرزي لور ده. نوموړې په دمشق کې زېږېدلې او هماغلته يې لومړنۍ زده کړې د خپل پلار نه ترلاسه کړي. Their she learned of western and modern values, which would influence her future actions and beliefs. Although Afghan, Soraya Tarzi was born in [[Syria]] because her family was in exile from [[Afghanistan]]. Once King Habibullah captured the throne, one of his most important contributions to Afghanistan was the return of Afghan exiles, and specifically that of [[Mahmud Tarzi]] around the turn of the century. If there is a single person responsible for the modernization of Afghanistan in the first two decades of the twenty-first century it was [[Mahmud Tarzi]].<ref>A History of Women in Afghanistan: Lessons Learnt fo...[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:hyYOs7qr4RUJ:www.bridgew.edu/SoAS/jiws/May03/Afghanistan.pdf+Queen+Soraya+tarzi&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=5 Link]</ref>. Upon her family's return, she would meet and merry King [[Amanullah Khan]].

After the Tarzi's returned to [[Afghanistan]], they were received at Court as wished by the Amir [[Habibullah Khan]]. This is where Soraya Tarzi met Prince [[Amanullah]], son of the Amir [[Habibullah Khan]]. They struck an affinity. The prince - who was a sympathiser of [[Mahmud Tarzi]]'s liberal ideas - merried Soraya Tarzi in 1913. Soraya Tarzi was King [[Amanullah Khan]]'s only wife, which broke centuries of tradition. It was when she merried into the [[monarchy]] that she grew to be one of the regions most importent figures. 

When the prince became Amir in [[1919]] and subsequently [[King]] in [[1926]], the [[Queen]] had an important role in the evolution of the Country, always close to her husband. He had her take part in all national events. He was said, ”I am your king, but the minister of Education is my wife - your Queen...”<ref>Mahmud Tarzi & Family...[http://www.mahmudtarzi.com/MahmudTarzi/InAfghanistan.asp Link]</ref>  Queen Soraya was the first [[Muslim]] sovereign who appeared in public together with her husband - unheard of at the time. She participated with him in the hunting parties, riding on horse back, and in some [[Cabinet]] meetings. She was present at [[Military Parades]] with the king. During the war of Independence, she visited the tents of wounded soldiers, talked to them, offerred them presents and comfort. She accompanied the king even in some rebellious provinces of the country which was a very dangerous thing to do at that time.<ref>Mahmud Tarzi & Family...[http://www.mahmudtarzi.com/MahmudTarzi/InAfghanistan.asp Link]</ref>

As Queen of Afghanistan, she was not only filling a position - but became one of the most influential women in the world at the time. As a feminist leader she...(read below)

Because of the reform King Amanullah Khan brought, the country's religious sect grew violent. In 1929, the King abdicated in order to prevent a civil war and went into exile. Their first stop was India (part of the British Empire). There, the sovereigns were applauded everywhere they went by thousands of Indian people. The Indian people felt they had lost their dream of freedom and liberation from British Emperialism with the fall of King [[Amanullah Khan]]s reign. There was also ovation from the Indian women who were crying and shouting the name of "Soraya" without mentioning "Queen."

===د ښځو حقونه===
Amanullah drew up the first constitution, establishing the basis for the formal structure of the government and setting up the role of the monarch within the constitutional framework. Amanullah was influenced and encouraged by [[Mahmud Tarzi]] in his endeavors. Tarzi was specifically instrumental in designing and implementing changes pertaining to women through his personal example of monogamy, education and employment of female family members and their unveiled public appearances. His daughter, Queen Soraya Tarzi would be the face of this change. Another daughter of Tarzi‘s married Amanullah‘s brother. Thus, it is not surprising that Tarzi‘s sophisticated and liberal intellectual ideology blossomed and concretely embedded itself in Amanullah‘s reign. 

King [[Amanullah Khan]] publicly campaigned against the veil, against polygamy, and encouraged education of girls not just in [[Kabul]] but also in the countryside. At a public function, Amanullah said that "Islam did not require women to cover their bodies or wear any special kind of veil." At the conclusion of the speech, Queen Soraya tore off her "veil" in public and the wives of other officials present at the meeting followed this example. Throughout her husband‘s reign, Queen Soraya, wore wide-brimmed hats with a diaphanous veil attached to them. Many women from Amanullah‘s family publicly participated in organizations and went on to become government officials later in life.<ref>Women of Afghanistan: The Stor...[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:hyYOs7qr4RUJ:www.bridgew.edu/SoAS/jiws/May03/Afghanistan.pdf+Queen+Soraya+tarzi&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=5 Link]</ref>. Upon her family's return, she would meet and merry King [[Amanullah Khan]]. 

With the help of Queen Soraya, women were encouraged to get an education and in that attempt, 15 young women were sent to [[Turkey]] for higher education in [[1928]]. Soraya was very instrumental in enforcing change for women and publicly exhorted them to be active participants in nation building. In [[1926]], at the 7th anniversary of Independence from the Brits, Soraya in a public speech delivered the following message:
<blockquote>
''It (Independence) belongs to all of us and that is why we celebrate it. Do you think, however, that our nation from the outset needs only men to serve it? Women should also take their part as women did in the early years of our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn that we must allcontribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.''<ref>Women of Afghanistan: The Stor...[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:hyYOs7qr4RUJ:www.bridgew.edu/SoAS/jiws/May03/Afghanistan.pdf+Queen+Soraya+tarzi&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=5 Link]</ref>

In 1927 and 1928 [[Amanullah Khan]] and his wife Soraya visited Europe. On this trip they were honored and feted. In fact, in 1928 the King and Queen received honorary degrees from Oxford University. This was an era when other Muslim nations, like Turkey and Egypt were also on the path to [[modernization]]. Hence, in Afghanistan, the elite was impressed by such changes and emulated their development models. However, the time was not right. Not only did conservative [[Muslims]] disagree with the changes, the British distributed pictures of Soraya without a veil, dining with foreign men, and having her hand kissed by the leader of [[France]], [[Germany]], etc. among tribal regions of Afghanistan. Conservative mullahs and regional leaders took the images and details from the royal family's trip to be a flagrant betrayal of Afghan culture, religion and "honor" of women. One can take the circulation of such images from foreign sources as evidence of British efforts to destabilize the Afghan monarchy, the first of many international attempts to keep the country in political, social and economic turmoil. The Brits were always working to stop Queen Soraya Tarzi and her [[feminist]] work of educating girls and getting them to participate in government. The British did not have a good relationship with Soraya's family as a whole, for the chief representative of [[Afghanistan]] that they had to deal with was her father, [[Mahmud Tarzi]]. When the royal family returned from [[Europe]], they were met with hostility and eventually forced out of office.<ref>Women of Afghanistan: The Stor...[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:hyYOs7qr4RUJ:www.bridgew.edu/SoAS/jiws/May03/Afghanistan.pdf+Queen+Soraya+tarzi&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=5 Link]</ref>

==د ژوند وروستۍ شېبې==
په [[۱۹۲۹]] زېږيز کال کې د افغانستان پاچا امير امان الله خان د واک نه پدې موخه ګوښه شو چې په هېواد کې د خپل منځي جګړې د پېښېدلو مخه ونيسي او اعلی حضرت امان الله خان د هېواد نه دباندې روم ته لاړ او ملکه ثريا هم هماغلته د خپلې کورنۍ سره په اېټاليې کې ژوند کاوه او په هغه وخت کې اېټاليا کې هم پاچاهي وه. 

She died on the 20th of April, [[1968]] in [[Rome, Italy]].

The funeral was escorted by the Italian military team to the airport of Rome, before being taken to Afghanistan where a solemn [[state funeral]] was held. She is burried in the family mausoleum in [[Jalalabad]], next to her husband the King, who has died eight years earlier.
