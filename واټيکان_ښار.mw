}}'''Vatican City''' {{CoorHeader | 41 | 54 | 10 | N | 12 | 27 | 9 | E | type:landmark_scale:5000}} — formally '''State of the Vatican City''', or '''Vatican City State''' ([[Italian language | Italian]]: ''Stato della Città del Vaticano'', [[Latin]]: ''Status Civitatis Vaticanae'') — is a [[sovereignty | sovereign]] [[polis]] whose territory consists of a landlocked [[enclave]] within the city of [[Rome, Italy]]. The entire state is about 44 [[hectare]]s (108.7&nbsp;[[acre]]s) and thus is a [[European microstates | European microstate]]. It is the smallest independent nation in the world. Since it is governed by the [[Bishop of Rome]] (the [[Pope]]), its government can be described as ecclesiastical and the highest state functionaries are in fact clergymen. It is the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]] ([[Latin]]:''Sancta Sedes'') and the location of the [[Apostolic Palace]] — the Pope's official residence — and the [[Roman Curia]]. Thus, although the principal ecclesiastical seat of the Holy See ([[Basilica of St. John Lateran]]) is located in Rome itself, the Vatican City can be said to be the governmental capital of the [[Roman Catholic Church | Catholic Church]] of both East and West.

== The territory ==

The placename is ancient and predates [[Christianity]], coming from the Latin ''Mons Vaticanus'', [[Vatican Hill]]. It is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields upon which [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the residence of the popes called the [[Apostolic Palace]], with its [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area until [[1929]] was part of the roman [[rione]] of [[borgo (rione of Rome) | Borgo]]. Being separated from the city by the river [[Tiber]], it was an outcrop of the city which was protected by being included by the walls of [[Leo IV]]. When the 1929 [[Lateran treaties]] that gave the state its present form was being prepared, the fact that a good part of the proposed territory was all but enclosed by this loop led to the present territorial definition being adopted. For some tracts of the frontier there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed. The territory included [[St. Peter's Square]], which it was not possible to isolate from the rest of Rome and therefore a largely imaginary border with Italy runs along the outer limit of the square where it touches on Piazza Pio XII and Via Paolo VI.

Although technically not included within the territory of the Vatican City State, according to the Lateran treaties, certain [[Properties of the Vatican | properties of the Holy See]] have an extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[embassy | embassies]]. These include the papal summer residence of [[Castelgandolfo]] in the nearby hills, the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran | Lateran Basilica]], the basilicas of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore | St. Mary Major]] and of [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls | St Paul Outside the Walls]], and a number of other buildings in Rome. Castelgandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of the Vatican City State and not by Italian police. St. Peter's Square is ordinarily policed jointly by both.

== د رياست مشر==

The [[Head of State]] is the [[Pope]], who as the supreme executive, legislative, and judicial authority is also the [[Head of Government]]. This is a non-hereditary [[elective monarchy]] with a sovereign who exercises [[Absolute monarchy | absolute authority]], that is to say supreme [[legislative]], [[executive (government) | executive]] and [[judicial]] power not only over Vatican City State but also constituting the [[Holy See]]. The sovereign is [[election | elected]] for a life term in [[conclave]] by [[Cardinal (Catholicism) | cardinals]] under the age of 80. His principal subordinate government officials are the [[Cardinal Secretary of State | Secretary of State]], the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], and the [[Governor of Vatican City]].

The [[as of 2006 | current]] Pope is [[Pope Benedict XVI | Benedict XVI]], born Joseph Ratzinger in [[Germany]]. [[Angelo Cardinal Sodano]] of [[Italy]] is the [[Cardinal Secretary of State | Secretary of State]]. Sodano will be succeded in this position by [[Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone]] effective September 15, 2006. [[Edmunld Cardinal Szoka]] serves as both the President of the Pontifical Commission and Governor, born an [[United States | American]] of [[Poles | Polish]] descent. Szoka will be succeded in this position by Archbishop [[Giovanni Lajolo]] effective September 15, 2006.

== History ==
{{main | History of the Vatican City}}
[[Image:VaticanCity_Annex.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Territory of Vatican City according to the [[Lateran treaties]].]]
It is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of [[Rome]] (the ''ager vaticanus'') had long been considered sacred, or at least not available for habitation, even before the arrival of [[Christianity]]. In [[326]], the first church, the Constantinian basilica, was built over the site that later Catholic apologists argue was the tomb of [[Saint Peter]], buried in a common cemetery on the spot; from then on the area started to become more populated, but mostly only by dwelling houses connected with the activity of St Peter's.

Popes in their secular role gradually came to govern neighbouring regions and, through the [[Papal States]], ruled a large portion of the [[Italy | Italian]] peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid [[19th century]], when most of the territory of the Papal States was seized by the [[Italian unification | newly created]] Kingdom of Italy. For much of this time the Vatican was not the habitual residence of the Popes, but rather the [[Lateran Palace]], and in recent centuries, the [[Quirinal Palace]], while the residence from 1309–1377 was at [[Avignon]] in [[France]].

In 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when [[Rome]] itself was annexed by the [[Piedmont]]ese after a nominal resistance by the papal forces.  The popes were left between 1870 and 1929 in a situation somewhat like that of the [[Puyi | last emperor of China]].  They were undisturbed in their palace, and given certain recognitions by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors.  But they did not recognize the Italian king's right to reign in Rome, and they [[prisoner in the Vatican | refused to leave the Vatican compound]] until the dispute was resolved in 1929.  Other states continued to maintain international recognition of the Holy See as a sovereign entity.  In practice Italy made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls.  However, they confiscated church property in many other places, including, perhaps most notably, the [[Quirinal Palace]], formerly the pope's official residence.  Pope Pius IX, the last ruler of the Papal States, said that after Rome was annexed he was a "[[Prisoner in the Vatican]]".  This situation was resolved on [[February 11]], [[1929]] under the premiership of [[Benito Mussolini | Mussolini]], by the three [[Lateran treaties]], which established the independent State of the Vatican City and granted [[Catholicism]] special status in Italy. The [[cathedra]] (official seat) of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, is in the Lateran Basilica, Rome's [[cathedral]]. In 1984, a new [[concordat]] between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholicism as the Italian state religion.

== Government ==
<!-- Please add new information into relevant articles of the series -->

{{morepolitics | country=the Vatican City}}
For historical reasons, the government of Vatican City has a unique structure. As noted, the principal figures are the [[Cardinal Secretary of State | Secretary of State]], the President of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Vatican City State]], and the [[Governor of Vatican City]]. These, like all other officials, are appointed by the Pope and can be dismissed by him at any time.

During a ''[[sede vacante]]'' (papal vacancy), the [[Camerlengo | Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church]], former Secretary of State, and former President of the Pontifical Commission form a commission that performs some of the functions of the head of state; while another made up of the Chamberlain and three cardinals (one being chosen by lot every three days from each order of cardinals), performs other functions of the head of state. All decisions of these commissions must be approved by the [[College of Cardinals]].

=== Administration of Vatican City ===
<!-- Please add new information into relevant articles of the series -->

The Governor of Vatican City, sometimes known as the President of Vatican City, has duties similar to those of a [[mayor]] or city executive, concentrating on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, but excluding external relations. The Vatican City maintains two modern security corps, the famous [[Swiss Guard]]s, a voluntary military force drawn from male Swiss citizens, and the ''Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano''. They are not really an army of the Vatican City State so much as a police force and the personal bodyguard of the Pope.

Legislative power is vested in the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], led by a president. Members are cardinals appointed by the pope for terms of five years.

The judicial functions are handled by three tribunals — the [[Apostolic Signatura]], the [[Sacra Rota Romana]], and the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]], which are also the judicial arm of the Holy See (see below). The legal system is based on canon, or ecclesiastical, law; if [[Canon law (Catholic Church) | Canon Law]] is not applicable, special laws of the territory apply, often modelled on Italian provisions.

=== Communications ===

Vatican City has its own post office, commissary (supermarket), bank (the [[automatic teller machine]]s are the only ones in the world to use [[Latin language | Latin]]), railway station, electricity generating plant, and [[publishing house]].

The Vatican also [[Vatican euro coins | issues its own coins]] and stamps and controls its own Internet domain ([[.va]]).

[[Vatican Radio]], the official radio station, is one of the most influential in Europe. ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' is the semi-official newspaper, published daily in Italian, and weekly in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French (plus a monthly edition in Polish). It is published by Catholic laymen but carries official information.

== Geography ==

[[Image:Vt-map.png|thumb|200px|Map of Vatican City]]
{{main | Geography of the Vatican City}}

The Vatican City, one of the [[European microstates]], is situated on the Vatican Hill in the north-western part of Rome, several hundred metres west of the [[Tiber]] river, on the latter's right bank. Its borders (3.2&nbsp;km or 2&nbsp;miles in total, all within Italy) closely follow the [[city wall]] constructed to protect the Pope from outside attack. The situation is more complex at the famous [[Saint Peter's Square | St. Peter's Square]] in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], where the correct border is just outside the ellipse formed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini | Bernini]]'s colonnade. The Vatican City is the smallest sovereign state in the world at 0.44 square kilometres (108.7&nbsp;[[acre]]s).

Its [[climate]] is clearly mostly the same as Rome's; a temperate, Mediterranean climate with mild, rainy winters from September to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to August. There are some local features, principally mists and dews, caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains and the size of the large paved square.

== Economy ==

[[Image:1e vat.jpg|right|frame|Vatican [[Euro coins | €1 coin]], showing [[Pope John Paul II]].]]
{{main | Economy of the Vatican City}}

This unique, non-commercial economy is also supported financially by contributions (known as [[Peter's Pence]]) from Catholics throughout the world, the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums, and the sale of publications. The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to, or somewhat better than, those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.

Vatican City has used the [[euro]] as its currency since [[January 1]], [[1999]], owing to a special agreement with the [[EU]] (council decision 1999/98/CE). Euro coins and notes were introduced in [[January 1]], [[2002]]. Due to its rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.

It also has its own bank, [[Vatican Bank]].

* Budget: Revenues (2003) $252 million; expenditures (2003) $264 million.
* Industries: printing and production of few mosaics and staff uniforms; worldwide banking and financial activities.
== Demographics ==
{{main | Demographics of the Vatican City}}
[[Image:Vat_swissGuard.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Swiss Guard]]

Almost all of Vatican City's 932 citizens live inside the Vatican's walls. The Vatican citizenry consists mainly of [[clergy]], including high dignitaries, priests, nuns, as well as the Swiss Guard. There are also about 3,000 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican work force, but who reside outside the Vatican. All of the City's citizens are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and Roman Catholicism is, rather obviously, the State religion of the country. There are no other places of worship inside the Vatican City other than private Catholic Chapels and [[St Peter's Basilica]].

The official language is [[Latin]]. [[Italian language | Italian]] and, to a lesser extent, other languages are generally used for most conversations, publications, and broadcasts. [[German language | German]] is the official language of the Swiss Guard. The Vatican's official website languages are [[Italian language | Italian]], [[German language | German]], [[English language | English]], [[French language | French]], [[Spanish language | Spanish]], and [[Portuguese language | Portuguese]].

=== Citizenship ===

Citizenship of the Vatican City is granted [[ius officii]]. That means it is invested to those who have been appointed to work at the Vatican, and it is usually revoked upon the termination of their employment. Also in the period of employment citizenship can also be extended to a Vatican citizen's spouse (unless the marriage is annulled or dissolved, or if a conjugal separation is decreed) and children (until they turn 25 if they are capable of working, or in the case of daughters, if they marry). Terms about citizenship are defined in the [[Lateran treaties]] and laws concerning the creation of the Vatican state in 1929, sought to restrict the number of people who could be granted Vatican citizenship. The only passports issued by the Vatican are diplomatic passports.

On [[31 December]] [[2002]] there were 555 people with Vatican citizenship, of whom all are dual-citizens to other countries (the majority being Italian). The Lateran Treaty states that in the event a Vatican citizen has their other nationality revoked, they will be automatically granted Italian citizenship. This would have been important had the authorities in pre-[[Solidarity]] Poland decided to strip [[Pope John Paul II]] of his Polish citizenship.

Among the 555 were:

* The Pope
* 57 Cardinals
* 293 Members of the clergy who serve as diplomatic envoys abroad
* 56 Lesser ranking clergy members who work in the Vatican
* 104 Officers, NCOs and men of the Papal Swiss Guard.
* 44 Lay persons

== Foreign relations ==
{{main | Holy See}}

Providing a territorial identity for the Holy See, the State of the Vatican City is a recognized national territory under international law. However, it is the Holy See that is the legal body that conducts diplomatic relations for the Vatican City in addition to the Holy See's usual [[diplomacy]], entering into international agreements and both receives and sends diplomatic representatives. Due to the very limited territory of the Vatican state, foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the Italian part of Rome; Italy actually hosts its own Embassy of Italy.

The Holy See is currently the only European political entity that has a formal diplomatic relation with [[Taiwan]].

== Culture ==

The Vatican City is itself of great cultural significance. Buildings such as St. Peter's Basilica and the [[Sistine Chapel]] are home to some of the most beautiful art in the world, which includes works by artists such as [[Sandro Botticelli | Botticelli]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini | Bernini]] and [[Michelangelo]]. The [[Vatican Library]] and the collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance.

The permanent population of the Vatican City is predominately male, although two orders of nuns live in the Vatican. A minority are senior Catholic [[clergy]]; the remainder are members of [[religious order]]s. Many workers in the Vatican City live outside its walls, including the Swiss Guard and embassy personnel.

Visitors must adhere to strict dress codes. Clothes that show the legs above the knees are strictly banned.

Tourism and pilgrimages are an important factor in the daily life of the Vatican. The Pope leads weekly [[Mass (liturgy) | Mass]] and other services, and appears on [[religious holiday]]s such as [[Easter]]. On significant events, such as beatification ceremonies, he leads open-air Mass in Saint Peter's Square.

== Crime ==

As a result of the Vatican having a small resident population, but millions of visitors every year, the state has the highest [[per capita crime rate]] of any nation on earth, more than twenty times higher than Italy. In his 2002 report to the pontifical court, Chief Prosecutor Nicola Picardi quoted statistics of 397 [[civil offences]] and 608 [[penal offences]]. Each year, hundreds of tourists fall victim to pickpockets and purse snatchers. The perpetrators, who are also visitors, are rarely caught, with 90% of crimes remaining unsolved.{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2639777.stm | title=Vatican crime rate 'soars'}}

Normally, for civil offenses the Italian courts will handle the disposition of these cases.

The most recent [[murder]] to occur in the Vatican was in [[1998]], when a member of the Swiss Guard killed two and then himself. [http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9805/05/vatican.murder.on/index.html]

== Transport and communications ==

[[Image:St peters vat distance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mussolini demolished a spina of medieval housing to create an avenue leading into St. Peter's Square.]]

The Vatican City has no airports. There is one [[heliport]] and an 852 metre (932 [[yard | yd]]) [[standard gauge]] (1435 mm) railway that connects to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station. The railway is used only to transport freight. Rome's metro line A passes about 10 minutes walk north of the Vatican.

The City is served by an independent, modern telephone system and post office. A bit of conventional wisdom in Rome is that international mail dropped in a mailbox in the Vatican will reach its destination more quickly than one dropped only a few hundred metres away in an Italian mailbox.{{facts}} People sending mail to the Vatican are advised not to write anything other than Vatican City State for the destination on the envelope. The reason for this is that this enables mail to be sent directly to the Vatican - otherwise it would go through the postal systems of other countries, which would cause a delay in shipment to the Vatican. The Vatican has an official website, radio station, and satellite TV channels.

One lucrative source of income for the state is a two-pump gasoline station where Italians can buy gas at prices up to 30% lower than in Italy, because the gas is not taxed. However, only people with special residence or work permits may use the station.<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/micro/2005/0407vatican.htm] www.globalpolicy.org retreived 23 June 2006</ref>
