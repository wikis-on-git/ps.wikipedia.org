{{rights}}
'''Human rights''' refers to the concept of [[human beings]] as having universal [[natural rights]], or status, regardless of legal [[jurisdiction]] or other [[localizing factor]]s, such as [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], and [[sex]]. As is evident in the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], human rights, at least in the post-war period, are conceptualized as based on inherent [[human dignity]], retaining their universal and inalienable character.

The existence, validity and the content of human rights continue to be the subject to debate in [[philosophy]] and [[political science]]. Legally, human rights are defined in [[international law]] and [[covenants]], and further, in the [[domestic law]]s of many states. However, for many people the [[doctrine]] of human rights goes beyond law and forms a fundamental moral basis for regulating the contemporary [[geo-political]] order. For them, they are [[democratic ideals]].

The idea of human rights descended from that of [[natural rights]]; some recognize no difference between the two and regard both as labels for the same thing while others choose to keep the terms separate to eliminate association with some features traditionally associated with natural rights.<ref>Peter Jones. Rights. Palgrave Macmillan, 1994, p. 73</ref>

== Human rights legislation ==

Where it has been adopted, [[legislation]] commonly contains:
*''[[right to life|security rights]]'' that protect people against crimes such as [[murder]], [[massacre]], [[torture]] and [[rape]]
*''[[liberty]] rights'' that protect freedoms in areas such as [[belief]] and [[religion]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of assembly|assembling]] and [[freedom of movement|movement]]
*''[[political]] rights'' that protect the liberty to participate in politics by [[freedom of expression|expressing themselves]], [[protesting]], participating in a [[republic]]
*''[[due process]] rights'' that protect against abuses of the legal system such as [[imprisonment]] without [[trial]], secret trials and excessive punishments
*''[[Social equality|equality]] rights'' that guarantee equal [[citizenship]], equality before the [[law]] and [[discrimination|nondiscrimination]]
*''[[welfare]] rights'' (also known as economic rights) that require the provision of [[education]] and protections against severe [[poverty]] and [[starvation]]
*''[[collective rights|group rights]]'' that provide protection for groups against ethnic [[genocide]] and for the ownership by countries of their national territories and resources

Appalled by the barbarism of the [[Second World War]], the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in [[1948]]. While not legally binding, it urged member nations to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the "foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world". The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the [[corelative|rights-duty duality]].

Many states wanted to go beyond the declaration of rights and create legal covenants which would put greater pressure on states to follow human rights norms. Because some states disagreed over whether this international covenant should contain economic and social rights (which usually require a greater effort to fulfill on the part of individual states), two treaties were prepared.

In [[1966]] and [[1976]] respectively, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] came into force. With the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] these documents form the [[International bill of rights]]. 
{{clr}}
{{Cquote|...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world|30px|30px|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}
Since then several other [[International human rights instruments|pieces of legislation]] have been introduced at the international level:

*[[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (entry into force: 1951) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm]
*[[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] (entry into force: 1984) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm]
*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (entry into force: 1969) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm]
*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (entry into force: 1981) [http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/frame.htm]
*[[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (entry into force: 1989) [http://www.unicef.org/crc/crc.htm]
*[[Rome Statute|Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] (entry into force: 2002)

With the exception of the non-deformable human rights (the four most important are the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of  penal laws), the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency - although "the emergency must be actual, affect the whole population and the threat must be to the very existence of the nation. The declaration of emergency must also be a last resort and a temporary measure" [http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/comp210.htm]. Conduct in war is governed by [[International Humanitarian Law]].

===International bodies===
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] created an agency, the [[Human Rights Committee]] to promote compliance with its norms. The 18 members of the committee express opinions as to whether a particular practice is a human rights violation, although its reports are not legally binding.

A modern interpretation of the original Declaration of Human Rights was made in the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993. The degree of unanimity over these conventions, in terms of how many and which countries have ratified them varies, as does the degree to which they are respected by various states. The UN has set up a number of bodies to monitor and study human rights, under the leadership of the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR).

===Regional legislation===
There are also many regional agreements and organisations governing human rights including the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which is the only international court with jurisdiction to deal with cases brought by individuals (rather than states); the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]]; [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]; [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]]; [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]; and Iran's [[Defenders of Human Rights Center]].

==د بشري حقونو تاريخ ==
:''See also: [[History of democracy]]''
[[Ur-Nammu]], the king of [[Ur]] created what was arguably the first legal codex in ca. [[2050]] BC. Several other sets of laws were created in [[Mesopotamia]] including the [[Code of Hammurabi]], (ca. 1780 BC) which is one of the best preserved examples of this type of document. It shows rules and punishments if those rules are broken on a variety of matters including [[Legal rights of women in history|women's rights]], [[children's rights]] and [[slavery|slave rights]].

[[Image:CyrusCylinder.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Cyrus Cylinder]]]]
The [[Achaemenid dynasty|Persian Empire]] ([[Iran]]) established unprecedented principles of human rights in the [[6th century BC]] under the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]]. After his conquest of [[Babylon]] in [[539 BC]], the king issued the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], discovered in [[1879]] and recognized by many today as the first human rights document. The cylinder declared that citizens of the empire would be allowed to practice their religious beliefs freely. It also abolished slavery, so all the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era where slaves typically did such work. These two reforms were reflected in the biblical books of [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], which state that Cyrus released the followers of [[Judaism]] from slavery and allowed them to migrate back to their land. The cylinder now lies in the [[British Museum]], and a replica is kept at the [[United Nations headquarters]].{{fact}}

Three centuries later, the [[Mauryan Empire]] of [[Kingdoms of Ancient India|ancient India]] established unprecedented principles of civil rights in the [[3rd century BC]] under the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]]. After his brutal conquest of [[Kalinga]] in circa [[265 BC]], he felt remorse for what he had done, and as a result, adopted [[Buddhism]]. From then, Ashoka, who had been described as "the cruel Ashoka" eventually came to be known as "the pious Ashoka". During his reign, he pursued an official policy of [[nonviolence]] (''[[ahimsa]]''). The unnecessary slaughter or mutilation of animals was immediately abolished, such as [[sport]] [[hunting]] and [[branding]]. Ashoka also showed mercy to those imprisoned, allowing them outside one day each year, and offered common citizens free education at [[university|universities]]. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics or [[caste]], and constructed free [[hospital]]s for both humans and animals. Ashoka defined the main principles of nonviolence, [[tolerance]] of all [[sect]]s and opinions, [[obedience]] to parents, [[respect]] for teachers and [[priest]]s, being [[liberal]] towards friends, humane treatment of [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s (slavery was non-existent in India at the time), and [[generosity]] towards all. These reforms are described in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Elsewhere societies have located the beginnings of human rights in religious documents. The [[Vedas]], the [[Bible]], the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Analects of Confucius]] are some of the oldest written sources which address questions of people’s duties, rights, and responsibilities.

In [[1215]] [[John of England|King John of England]] issued the [[Magna Carta]], a document forced upon him by the [[Pope]] and [[England|English]] [[barons]], which required him to renounce certain rights, respect certain legal procedures and accept that ''the will of the king could be bound by law''. Although the document did not itself limit the power of the king in the [[Middle Ages]], its later reinterpretation in the [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethean]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] periods established it as a powerful document on which [[constitutional law]] was founded in [[Britain]] and elsewhere.

In [[1222]], the [[Manden Charter]] in [[Mali]] was a declaration of essential human rights, including the right to life, and opposed the practice of slavery.

Several [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century]] European philosophers, most notably [[John Locke]], developed the concept of ''natural rights'', the notion that people possess certain rights by virtue of being human. Though Locke believed natural rights were derived from divinity since [[human being|humans]] were creations of [[God]], his ideas were important in the development of the modern notion of rights. Lockean natural rights did not rely on citizenship nor any law of the state, nor were they necessarily limited to one particular ethnic, cultural or religious group.

[[Image:Us_declaration_independence.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''U.S. Declaration of Independence'' ratified by the [[Continental Congress]] on [[July 4]], [[1776]]]]
Two major revolutions occurred that century in the [[United States]] (1776) and in [[France]] (1789). The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] includes concepts of natural rights and famously states "that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 
[[Image:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' approved by the National Assembly of France, [[August 26]], [[1789]]]]
Similarly, the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] defines a set of individual and collective rights of the people. These are held to be universal - not only to French citizens but to ''all men without exception''.

Philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Hegel]] expanded on the theme of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] during the 18th and [[19th century|19th]] centuries. In [[1831]] [[William Lloyd Garrison]] wrote in a newspaper called ''[[The Liberator]]'' that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights"<ref>Mayer, Henry "All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery" St. Martin's Press, 1998, p. 110</ref> so the term ''human rights'' probably came into use sometime between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and Garrison's publication. In 1849 a contemporary, [[Henry David Thoreau]], wrote about human rights in his treatise ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]]'' [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/civ.dis.html] which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers. United States [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|Supreme Court Justice Davis Davis]], in his [[1867]] opinion for [[Ex Parte Milligan]], wrote "By the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people."<ref>''Ex Parte Milligan'', 71 U.S. 2, 119.</ref>

Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the [[20th century]] in the name of human rights. In [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]], [[trade union|labour union]]s brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[vote]]. [[National liberation]] movements in many countries succeeded in driving out [[colony|colonial]] powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native [[India]] from [[United Kingdom|British]] rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent diverse [[identity politics]] movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.

===Types===
{{rights}}

Human rights are sometimes divided into '''[[negative and positive rights]]'''. Negative human rights, which follow mainly from the Anglo-American legal tradition, denote actions that a government should not take. These are codified in the Scottish [[Claim of Right]], the [[English Bill of Rights]] the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and include right to life and security of person; freedom from [[slavery]]; equality before the law and [[due process]] under the [[rule of law]]; freedom of movement; and freedoms of [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and the [[right to bear arms]] for collective and individual defense.

Positive human rights mainly follow from the [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauian]] [[Continental European]] legal tradition and denote rights that the state is obliged to protect and provide. Examples of such rights include: the rights to education, to a livelihood, to legal equality. Positive rights have been codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in many 20th-century [[list of national constitutions|constitutions]].

Another categorization, offered by [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are '''[[three generations of human rights]]''': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. Some theorists discredit these divisions by claiming that rights are interconnected. Arguably, for example, basic education is necessary for the right to political participation.

===Justification of human rights===
Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how human rights become part of social expectations. The '''[[Biology|biological]] theory''' considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and [[altruism]] in the context of [[natural selection]]. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior, which is a human, social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]) or as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). This approach includes the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]).

On the other hand, '''[[Natural law|natural law theories]]''' base human rights on the “natural” moral order that derives from religious precepts such as common understandings of justice and the belief that moral behavior is a set of objectively valid prescriptions. Some have used religious texts such as the [[Bible]] and [[Qur'an]] to support human rights arguments. However, there are also more secular forms of natural law theory that understand human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.

Yet others have attempted to construct an "'''[[interests theory]]'''" [[defence]] of human rights. For example the philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being. Some interest-theorists also justify the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest (rather than altruism or benevolence). Reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own will be protected.

Ultimately, the term "human rights" is often itself an appeal to a transcendent principle, not based on existing legal concepts. The term "[[humanism]]" refers to the developing doctrine of such [[universality|universally applicable]] values. The term "human rights" has replaced the term "[[natural rights]]" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring [[natural law]] for their existence.<ref>Weston, Burns H. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&ct=eb ''Human Rights''] in Encyclopedia Britannica Online, p. 2, Retrieved May 18, 2006</ref>

==Criticism of human rights==
One of the arguments made against the concept of human rights is that it suffers from [[cultural imperialism]]. In particular, the concept of human rights is fundamentally rooted in a politically [[liberalism|liberal]] outlook which, although generally accepted in [[Western Europe]], [[Japan]], [[India]] and [[North America]], is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere. An appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers, such as [[John Locke]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], have all been Western and indeed that some were involved in the running of [[Empire]]s themselves. The cultural imperialism argument achieves even greater potency when it is made on the basis of [[religion]]. Some histories of human rights emphasise the [[Christian]] influence on the agenda and then question whether this is in keeping with the tenets of other [[world religions]]. For example, in [[1981]], the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], [[Said Rajaie-Khorassani]], articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.<ref name="Littman1999">Littman, David. "Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'". ''Midstream'', February/March 1999</ref>.

Yet, some feel that the cultural imperialism argument is not entirely factual. While Western political philosophers like Locke, Hobbes and Mill made important contributions to the development of modern notions of human rights, the concept of human rights itself has origins in many world cultures and religions, including Christian, Jewish and Islamic traditions. Additionally, this argument leads to [[absolute relativism]] if taken too far. If all viewpoints and moral frameworks are equally valid then one cannot condemn any behaviour, however outrageous or horrific. In practice, human rights offer a basis to criticise such behavior or conduct, including [[imperialism]]. As such, human rights can be a transformative tool for [[self-determination]].

One way out of the cultural imperialism and relativism debate is to argue that the body of human rights exists in a hierarchy or can undergo ''derogation''. The relationship between different rights is complex since it can be argued that some are mutually reinforcing or supportive. For example, political rights, such as the right to hold office, cannot be fully exercised without other social and cultural pre-requisites, such as a decent education. Whether the latter should therefore be included as a first-generation right is a debated point.

[[Matthias Storme]] has stated that he sees little difference between the [[theocracy]] of Iran, and the human rights of West Europe, because they interfere with [[liberty|personal freedom]]. He also stated that the right to discriminate is a fundamental human right. <ref>[http://www.politics.be/duiding/523/ Matthias Storme & de vrijheid om te discrimineren] ("''Matthias Storme & the freedom to discriminate''") Politics.be</ref>

Another important philosophical criticism of human rights is their presumed basis in [[morality]]. If moral beliefs are fundamentally expressions of individuals' personally held preferences then the objective morality upon which human rights are founded is rejected. [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that human rights are not based upon the exercise of reason but a sentimental vision of humanity (even though he does support human rights in law on the basis of interests theory). [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has written that a belief in rights is on a par with "belief in [[witch]]es and [[unicorn]]s"<ref>MacIntyre, Alasdair (1981):''After Virtue'', pp. 69-70, London, Duckworth</ref>. But without care this criticism can become an apology for all behaviour as it aligns closely with [[moral relativism]]. It offends some by claiming that moral beliefs are personally held preferences and that there are no objective criterion to deduce valid moral beliefs from.

A final set of debating points revolves around the question of who has the duty to uphold human rights. Human rights have historically arisen from the need to protect citizens from abuse by the state and this might suggest that all mankind has a duty to intervene and protect people wherever they are. Divisive national loyalties, which emphasise differences between people rather than their similarities, can thus be seen as a destructive influence on the human rights movement because they deny people's innately similar human qualities<ref>Klitou, Demetrius ''The Friends and Foes of Human Rights''</ref>. But others argue that [[state sovereignty]] is paramount, not least because it is often the state that has signed up to human rights treaties in the first place. Commentators' positions in the argument for and against [[interventionism (politics)|intervention]] and the [[use of force by states]] are influenced by whether they believe human rights are largely a legal or moral duty and whether they are of more [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] or [[nationalism|nationalist]] persuasion.

==Violations of human rights==
Human rights Violation is [[abuse]] of people in a way that it abuses any fundamental human rights. It is a term used when a government violates national or international law related to the protection of human rights.

According to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], fundamental human rights are violated when, among other things:

* A certain [[race]], [[creed]], or group is denied recognition as a "person". (Articles 2 & 6)
* Men and women are not treated as equal. (Article 2)
* Different racial or religious groups are not treated as equal. (Article 2)
* Life, liberty or security of person are threatened. (Article 3)
* A person is sold as or used as a [[slavery|slave]]. (Article 4)
* [[Cruel and unusual punishment|Cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment]] is used on a person (such as [[torture]] or [[execution (legal)|execution]]). (Article 5) (See also [[Prisoners' rights]])
* Victims of abuse are denied an effective [[judicial]] remedy. (Article 8)
* Punishments are dealt arbitrarily or unilaterally, without a proper and [[right to a fair trial|fair trial]]. (Article 11)
* Arbitrary interference into personal, or private lives by agents of the state. (Article 12)
* Citizens are forbidden to leave or return to their country. (Article 13)
* [[Freedom of speech]] or [[freedom of religion|religion]] are denied. (Articles 18 & 19)
* The right to join a [[trade union]] is denied. (Article 23)
* Education is denied. (Article 26)

===Monitoring===
Human rights violations and abuses include those documented by [[non-governmental organizations]] such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[World Organisation Against Torture]], [[Freedom House]], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] and [[Anti-Slavery International]]. 

Only a very few countries do not commit significant human rights violations, according to Amnesty International. In their [[2004]] human rights report (covering [[2003]]) the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Costa Rica]] are the only (mappable) countries that did not violate at least some human rights significantly.{{fact}} 

Some people believe human rights abuses are more common in [[dictatorship]]s or [[theocracy|theocracies]] than in [[democracy|democracies]] because [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] tend to uncover state orchestrated abuse and expose it. Nonetheless human rights abuses do occur in democracies. For example, the Macpherson report found that the British police had been institutionally [[racism|racist]] in the handling of the death of [[Stephen Lawrence]]. Also Amnesty International has called the running of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] by the [[United States]] "a human rights scandal" in a series of reports [http://web.amnesty.org/pages/guantanamobay-index-eng].

In over 90 countries National human rights institutions (NHRIs)<ref>[http://www.nhri.net National Human Rights Institutions Forum]</ref> have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights in a given country. There are now over 90 such bodies. Not all of them are compliant with the United Nations standards as set out in the 1993 Paris Principles, but the amount and effect of these institutions is increasing.

[http://www.huridocs.org HURIDOCS] has developed extensive methodologies for monitoring and documenting human rights violations, and more resources can be found at [http://www.humanrightstools.org/dir/1__Monitoring_-_brown_Documentation_-_Advocacy/Monitoring_and_fact-finding_/ Human Rights Tools].
