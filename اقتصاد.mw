An '''economy''' consists of the realized [[economic system]] of a country or other area, the [[labor]], [[capital]] and [[land]] [[resources]], and the [[economic agent]]s that socially participate in the [[Manufacturing|production]], [[Trade|exchange]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[goods (economics)|goods]] and services of that area.  A given economy is the end result of a process that involves its [[technological evolution]], [[history]] and [[social organization]], as well as its [[geography]], [[natural resource]] endowment, and [[ecology]], as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. 

Today the range of fields of study exploring, registering and describing the economy or a part of it, include [[social sciences]] such as [[economics]], as well as branches of [[history]] ([[economic history]]) or [[geography]] ([[economic geography]]). Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole, range from [[engineering]] to [[management]] and [[business administration]] to [[applied science]] to [[finance]]. All kind of [[profession]]s, [[List of occupations|occupations]], [[economic agent]]s or economic activities, contribute to the economy. [[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]], [[saving (money)|saving]] and [[investment]] are core variable components in the economy and determine market equilibrium. There are three main sectors of economic activity: [[Primary sector of the economy|primary]], [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary]] and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]].

== Etymology ==
The English words "economy" and "economics" can be traced back to the Greek words ''οἰκονόμος'' "one who manages a household" (derived from ''οἴκος'' "house", and ''νέμω'' "distribute (especially, manage)"), ''οἰκονομία'' "household management", and ''οἰκονομικός'' "of a household or family". The first recorded sense of the word "economy", found in a work possibly composed in 1440, is "the management of economic affairs", in this case, of a monastery. Economy is later recorded in more general senses including "thrift" and "administration". The most frequently used current sense, "the economic system of a country or an area", seems not to have developed until the 19th or 20th century.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/economy Dictionary.com], "economy."

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===

As long as someone has been making and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. [[Sumer]] developed a large scale economy based on [[commodity money]], while the [[Babylonians]] and their neighboring [[city states]] later developed the earliest system of [[economics]] as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on [[debt]], legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.<ref name=Sheila>Sheila C. Dow (2005), "Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply", ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' '''27''' (3), p. 385-391.</ref>

The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts.<ref name="yale2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm|title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction|accessdate=September 14 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=Yale University|year=1915|author=Charles F. Horne, Ph.D.}}</ref> They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. 

Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records and other pursuits. Ways to divide private property, when it is contended... amounts of interest on debt... rules as to property and monetary compensation concerning property damage or physical damage to a person... fines for 'wrong doing'... and compensation in money for various infractions of formalized law were standardized for the first time in history.<ref name="Sheila"/>

The ancient economy was mainly based on [[subsistence farming]]. The [[Shekel]] referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of [[barley]] which related other values in a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] such as silver, bronze, copper etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of [[currency]] and a unit of weight... just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one pound mass of silver.

For most people the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships.  There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In [[Ancient Greece]], where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were [[bond slaves]] of the [[freeholders]]. Economic discussion was driven by [[scarcity]]. [[Aristotle]] (384-322 B.C.) was the first to differentiate between a [[use value]] and an [[exchange value]] of goods. (Politics, Book I.) The [[exchange ratio]] he defined was not only the expression of the value of goods but of the relations between the people involved in [[trade]]. For most of the time in history economy therefore stood in opposition to institutions with ''fixed'' exchange ratios as [[reign]], [[Sovereign state|state]], [[religion]], [[culture]], and [[tradition]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Middle ages ===
In [[Medieval]] times, what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence level.  Most exchange occurred within social groups. On top of this, the great conquerors raised [[venture capital]] (from ''ventura'', ital.; ''risk'') to finance their captures. The capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the [[New World]]. Merchants such as [[Jakob Fugger]] (1459–1525) and [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]] (1360–1428) founded the first [[bank]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The discoveries of [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324), [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506) and [[Vasco de Gama]] (1469–1524) led to a first [[globalization|global]] economy. The first [[Company|enterprises]] were trading establishments. In 1513 the first [[stock exchange]] was founded in [[Antwerpen]]. Economy at the time meant primarily [[trade]]

=== Early modern times ===
The European captures became branches of the [[Europe]]an states, the so-called [[colonies]]. The rising [[nation-state]]s [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]] tried to control the trade through [[custom duties]] and [[taxes]] in order to protect their national economy. The so-called [[mercantilism]] (from ''mercator'', lat.: [[merchant]]) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and [[public interest]].
The [[secularization]] in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the [[nobles]] decreased. The first [[Secretaries of State]] for economy started their work. [[Bankers]] like [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and [[infrastructure]]. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the [[citizens]] of a state.

=== The industrial revolution ===
The first [[economist]] in the true meaning of the word was the Scotsman [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790). He defined the elements of a national economy: [[Product (business)|products]] are offered at a [[natural price]] generated by the use of [[competition]] - [[supply and demand]] - and the [[division of labour]]. He maintained that the basic motive for [[free trade]] is human [[self interest]]. The so-called [[self interest hypothesis]] became the [[anthropological]] basis for economics. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of [[overpopulation]]. The [[United States of America]] became the place where millions of [[expatriates]] from all European countries were searching for free [[economic evolvement]].
In Europe wild [[capitalism]] started to replace the system of [[mercantilism]] (today: [[protectionism]]) and led to [[economic growth]]. The period today is called [[industrial revolution]] because the system of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] and [[division of labour]] enabled the [[mass production]] of [[goods]].

=== Communism and its view of capitalism ===
Starting in [[England]], simultaneous related processes of mechanization, and the enclosures of the commons, led to increases in wealth for the controllers of capital, and mass [[poverty]], [[starvation]], [[urbanization]] and [[pauperization]] for much of the population {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. This led some, such as [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and the German industrialist and philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]], (1820–1895) to describe economy as the "system of capitalism". 

[[Capitalism]] is characterized by the division of labor between worker and capitalist, in which the [[means of production]] are separated from the direct producers and are instead owned by a parasitical capitalist class. Marx and Engels believed that under capitalism, the working class produces [[surplus value]], of which only a small percentage is returned to workers in the form of wages to provide for their bare subsistence. The rest of the surplus value is kept as profit, and is reinvested into the [[commodity cycle]] by the capitalist. The competitive forces of the market will drive [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to constantly [[Capital accumulation|accumulate]] "for the sake of more accumulation", resulting in monopolies, [[economic crisis]] and [[imperialism]]. 

Marx and Engels viewed capitalism as a historically-specific mode of production, as with feudalism and [[primitive communism|hunter-gatherer societies]], embedded with its own internal contradictions. Capitalism is the first mode of production in which the direct producers have no control over their conditions of labour or the means of production. 

The declining living conditions of the [[working class]] would drive workers to collectively fight back as part of a [[class struggle]], eventually overthrowing the capitalist state in a proletarian revolution and establishing a democratically planned economy, in which production is controlled by the direct producers themselves - the [[proletariat]] - in order to satisfy human needs, not accumulation of profits. Thus in the [[Communist Manifesto]], Marx and Engels state that capitalism, in bringing to existence an urbanized working class, has created its own "gravediggers", as well as the material conditions and abundance ripe for a classless socialist society.

The first [[centrally planned economy]] was established after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], led by the [[Old Bolsheviks|Bolshevik Party]], in which production (and social life) was organized around workers' councils called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]. Similar councils of democratically elected recallable worker delegates have existed in subsequent revolutions and revolutionary situations throughout the 20th Century, including the 1936 [[Spanish Revolution]], the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal, the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] and the 1980 [[Solidarity]] uprising in Poland.

=== After World War II ===
After the chaos of two [[World War]]s and the devastating [[Great Depression]], policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy. This was explored and discussed by [[Friedrich August von Hayek]] (1899–1992) and [[Milton Friedman]] (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global [[free trade]] and are supposed to be the fathers of the so called [[neoliberalism]]. However, the prevailing view was that held by [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the [[markets]] by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called [[Keynesianism]] in his honor. In the late 1950s the economic growth in America and Europe—often called [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (ger: ''economic miracle'') —brought up a new form of economy: [[mass consumption economy]]. In 1958 [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an [[affluent society]]. In most of the countries the economic system is called a [[social market economy]].

=== Postmodern economy ===
What economist [[Robert Reich]] terms, "the not quite golden age" (WW II to the mid-1970s) gave way to the current global economy, or ''supercapitalism''.<ref>Robert Reich, ''Supercapitalism: the Transformation of Business, Democracy and Everyday Life'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2007)</ref>  This economic revolution took place in tandem with a radical transformation of Western cultures, and the growth of oligarchical/plutocratic tendencies within the polities of Western democracies.

Discussion of such issues as the politics of the [[World Bank]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and global players within the [[World Economic Forum]], as well as global [[ecology]] and [[sustainability]], have all influenced the definition of ''economy''.

[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] has defined economy to be a ''[[global public good]]''. [[Economists]] like [[Peter Barnes (economist)|Peter Barnes]] and Alexander Dill are reclaiming the [[commons]] and providing definitions that embrace new phenomena like [[freeware]]. [[Game theory|Game theorists]] such as [[Ernst Fehr]] and Klaus M. Schmidt are contradicting the notion of omnipresent economic self-interest. Under the [[gift economy]] extensive [[grassroot]] movements have arisen; also the credit programs of Nobel laureate [[Muhammed Yunus]]. In 2006 the [[World Bank]] started issuing its ''Wealth of Nations Report'', tracking [[social capital|social]] and [[human capital]].

== Economic sectors ==
{{main|Economic sectors}}
The economy includes several sectors (also called [[industries]]), that evolved in successive phases.

* The [[Classical antiquity|ancient economy]] was mainly based on [[subsistence]] farming. 

* The [[industrial revolution]] lessened the role of [[subsistence]] farming, converting it to more [[extensive farming|extensive]] and [[monoculture|monocultural]] forms of agriculture in the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. 

* In the economies of modern [[consumer society|consumer societies]] there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology—the ([[knowledge economy]]). 

In modern economies, there are four main sectors of economic activity:{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* '''[[Primary sector of the economy]]:''' Involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. (A coal miner and a fisherman would be workers in the primary sector.)
* '''[[Secondary sector of the economy]]:''' Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary sector.)
* '''[[Tertiary sector of the economy]]:''' Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary sector.)
* '''[[Quaternary sector of the economy]]:''' Involves the research and development needed to produce products from natural resources. (A logging company might research ways to use partially burnt wood to be processed so that the undamaged portions of it can be made into pulp for paper.) Note that education is sometimes included in this sector.

More details about the various phases of [[economic development]] belong to the history section on this article. As this process was far from being homogeneous geographically, the balance between these sectors differs widely among the various regions of the world.

Other sectors include the 

* [[Public Sector]] or state sector
* [[Private Sector]] or privately-run businesses
* [[Social sector]] or [[Voluntary sector]]

== Economic measures ==
There are a number of ways to measure economic activity of a nation. These methods of measuring economic activity include:

* [[Consumer spending]]
* [[Exchange Rate]]
* [[Gross domestic product]]
* [[GDP per capita]]
* [[GNP]]
* [[Stock Market]]
* [[Interest Rate]]
* [[National Debt]]
* [[Inflation|Rate of Inflation]]
* [[Unemployment]]
* [[Balance of Trade]]

=== GDP ===
The [[GDP]] - Gross domestic product of a country is a measure of the size of its economy. The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and [[GDP per capita]].  While often useful, it should be noted that GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged.

== Informal economy ==
{{main|Informal economy}}

An informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government, contrasted with a formal economy. The informal economy is thus not included in that government's [[Gross National Product]] (GNP). Although the informal economy is often associated with [[developing countries]], all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion.

Informal economic activity is a dynamic process which includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement. By its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measure. No single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit of study.

The terms "under the table" and "off the books" typically refer to this type of economy. The term [[black market]] refers to a specific subset of the informal economy. The term "informal sector" was used in many earlier studies, and has been mostly replaced in more recent studies which use the newer term.

Micro economics are focused on an individual person in a given economic society and Macro economics is looking at an economy as a whole. (town, city, region)
