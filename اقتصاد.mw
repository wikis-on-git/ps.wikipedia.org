'''Economy''' refers to the human activities related with the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services. However, its definition transformed throughout history with the activities attributed to economy. The composition of a given economy is inseparable from civilization's [[history]] and [[social organization]], and from Earth's [[geography]] and [[ecology]], e.g. ecoregions which represent different [[agricultural]] and [[resource extraction]] opportunities, among other factors. 

The fields of study exploring, registering and describing the economy or a part of it, belong in general to the [[social sciences]] and include [[economics]] as well as branches of [[history]] ([[economic history]]) or [[geography]] ([[economic geography]]).  Subgroups of economics are [[macroeconomics]], [[microeconomics]], [[econometrics]], [[national economy]], [[political economy]], [[classical economy]], [[economic anthropology]], [[economic democracy]] and more. Economic measures such as the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) are part of [[econometrics]]. Practical fields more directly related to the human activities involving production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole, range from [[engineering]] to [[management]] and [[business administration]] to [[applied science]] to [[finance]].

The economy includes several sectors (also called [[industries]]), that evolved in successive phases.

* The [[ancient economics|ancient economy]] was mainly based on [[subsistence]] farming. 

* The [[industrial revolution]] lessened the role of [[subsistence]] farming, converting it to more [[extensive farming| extensive]] and [[monoculture|monocultural]] forms of agriculture in the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. 

* In the economies of modern [[consumer society|consumer societies]] there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology -- the([[knowledge economy]]). 

More details about the various phases of [[economic development]] follow. As this process was far from being homogenous geographically, the balance between these sectors differs widely among the various regions of the world.

==History==
===Ancient times===

The ancient economy was mainly based on [[subsistence farming]]. The exchange of goods happened within a [[barter economy]]. In [[Ancient Greece]], when the word 'economy' arose, the majority of people were [[bond slaves]] of the [[freeholders]]. Economic discussion was driven by [[scarcity]]. [[Aristotle]] (384-322 B.C.) was the first to differentiate between a [[use value]] and an [[exchange value]] of goods. (Politics, Book I). The [[exchange ratio]] he defined was not only the expression of the value of goods but of the relations between the people involved in [[trade]].
Economy became a synonym for trade, [[money]] and [[profit]]. For most of the time in history economy therefore stood in opposition to institutions with ''fixed'' exchange ratios as [[reign]], [[state]], [[religion]], [[culture]] and [[tradition]].

===Middle ages===

In [[Medieval]] times the great conquerors raised [[venture capital]] (from ''ventura'', ital.; ''risk'') to finance their captures. The capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the [[New World]]. Merchants such as [[Jakob Fugger]] (1459-1525) and [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]] (1360-1428) founded the first [[bank]]s. The discoveries of [[Marco Polo]] (1254-1324), [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451-1506) [[Vasco de Gama]] (1469-1524) lead to a first [[World economy]], meaning international trade between the continents. The first [[enterprises]] therefore were trading establishments. In 1513 the first [[stock exchange]] was founded in [[Antwerpen]]. Economy at the time meant firstly [[trade]].

===Early modern times ===

The European captures became branches of the [[Europe]]an states, the so-called [[colonies]]. The rising [[nation-state]]s [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]] tried to control the trade through [[custom duties]] and [[taxes]] in order to protect their national economy. The so-called [[mercantilism]] (from ''mercator'', lat.: [[merchant]]) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and [[public interest]].
The [[secularization]] in Europe allowed to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the [[nobles]] decreased. The first [[secretaries of state]] for economy started their work. [[Bankers]] like [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773-1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and [[infrastructure]]. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the [[citizens]] of a [[state]].

=== The industrial revolution===

The first [[economist]] in the true meaning of the word was the Scotsman [[Adam Smith]] (1723-1790). He defined the elements of a national economy: [[products]] are offered at a [[natural price]] generated by the use of [[competition]] - [[supply]] and [[demand]] - and the [[division of labour]]. He maintained that the basic motive for [[free trade]] is human [[self interest]]. The so-called [[self interest hypothesis]] became the [[anthropological]] basis for economics. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766-1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of [[over population]]. The [[United States of America]] became the place where millions of [[expatriates]] from all European countries were searching for free [[economic evolvement]].
In Europe [[wild capitalism]] started to replace the system of [[mercantilism]] (today: [[protectionism]]) and lead to [[economic growth]]. The period today is called [[industrial revolution]] because the system of [[production]] and [[division of labour]] enabled the [[mass production]] of [[goods]].

=== Capitalism and communism ===

Especially in [[England]] the ideas of [[Adam Smith]] became reality while the [[economization]]—the process of always diminishing the [[efforts of production]]—lead to [[mass poverty]], [[starvation]], [[urbanization]] and [[pauperization]] of the population. [[Karl Marx]] (1818-1883) and the German industrialist and philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820-1895) described economy as the "system of capitalism". 
The [[exploitation]] of [[labour]] and nature by the capitalist is creating a [[surplus value]]. The [[capital]] will [[Capital accumulation|accumulate]] itself and finally destroy the [[competition]]. Therefore the system of [[communism]] should liberate the economy from the reign of capital. The first [[centrally planned economy]] was established after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] by [[Lenin]].
Other states launched [[social security]] systems in order to minimize the effects of uncontrolled capitalism, called [[Manchester capitalism]].

=== After World War II===

In order to build up the countries being destroyed in two [[World Wars]] new definitions of economy were needed. [[Friedrich August von Hayek]] (1899-1992) and [[Milton Friedman]] (1912-2006) pleaded for a global [[free trade]] and are supposed to be the fathers of the so called [[neoliberalism]]. In opposite, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) argued for a stronger control of the [[markets]] by the state. The theory that the state could alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called [[Keynesianism]]. In the late 1950s the economic growth in America and Europe—often called [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (ger.: ''economic miracle'')—brought up a new form of economy: [[consumption]]. In 1958 [[Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908-2006) was the first to speak of an [[affluent society]]. In most of the countries the economic system is called a [[social market economy]].

=== Postmodern society ===

The [[globalization]] pushes national economies and rules in the backyard. The global and controversial discussion on the politics of the [[World Bank]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[Global Players]] within the [[World Economic Forum]] as well as the discussion of global [[ecology]] and [[sustainability]] issues influences the definition of economy.
[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] today defines economy to be a ''global public good''. [[Economists]] like [[Peter Barnes]] and [[Alexander Dill]] are reclaiming the [[commons]] and give new definitions including new phenomena like [[freeware]]. [[Game theory|Game theorists]] such as [[Ernst Fehr]] and [[Klaus M. Schmidt]] are disproving the [[self-interest hypothesis]]. A so-called [[gift economy]] is the topic for widespread activities of [[grassroot]] movements as well as of the credit programs of Nobel laureate [[Muhammed Yunus]]. The Wealth of Nations Report 2006 of the[[ World Bank]] for the first times tracks [[social]] and [[human capital]]. The change of definitions is to be continued.
