'''Central Asia''' is a region of [[Asia]] from the [[Caspian Sea]] in the west to central [[China]] in the east, and from southern [[Russia]] in the north to northern [[India]] in the south. It is also sometimes known as '''Middle Asia''' or '''[[Inner Asia]]''', and is within the scope of the wider [[Eurasia]]n continent. 

Various definitions of its exact composition exist and no one definition is universally accepted. Despite this uncertainty in defining borders, it does have some important overall characteristics. For one, Central Asia has historically been closely tied to its [[nomad]]ic peoples and the [[Silk Road]].<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Central_Asia Steppe Nomads and Central Asia]</ref> As a result, it has acted as a crossroads for the movement of people, goods, and ideas between [[Europe]], [[West Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[East Asia]].<ref>[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml Travelers on the Silk Road]</ref>

In modern context, Central Asia consists of the five former [[Soviet]] republics of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. Other areas are often included such as [[Mongolia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Khorasan Province|north-eastern Iran]], north-western [[India]], and western parts of the [[People's Republic of China]] such as [[Xinjiang]]. South-western and middle China such as [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]] and [[Inner Mongolia]], and southern parts of [[Siberia]] may also be included in Central Asia.

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, Central Asia was a predominantely [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]<ref name="ReferenceA">Encyclopædia Iranica, "CENTRAL ASIA: The Islamic period up to the mongols", C. Edmund Bosworth: "In early Islamic times Persians tended to identify all the lands to the northeast of Khorasan and lying beyond the Oxus with the region of Turan, which in the Shahnama of Ferdowsi is regarded as the land allotted to Fereydun's son Tur. The denizens of Turan were held to include the Turks, in the first four centuries of Islam essentially those nomadizing beyond the Jaxartes, and behind them the Chinese (see Kowalski; Minorsky, "Turan"). Turan thus became both an ethnic and a geographical term, but always containing ambiguities and contradictions, arising from the fact that all through Islamic times the lands immediately beyond the Oxus and along its lower reaches were the homes not of Turks but of Iranian peoples, such as the Sogdians and Khwarezmians."</ref><ref>C.E.

The ancient sedentary population played an important role in the history of Central Asia. [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Panjabi]], [[Pamiris]] and other Iranian groups are still present in the region. After expansion by [[Turkic peoples]], central Asia became also the homeland for many [[Turkic peoples]], including the [[Uzbeks]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz]], and [[Uyghurs]], and Central Asia is sometimes referred to as [[Turkestan]].

==Definitions==
[[Image:Central Asia borders4.png|260px|thumb|Three sets of possible boundaries for the region]]
[[Image:Central Asia world region2.png|326px|thumb|Central Asia's location as a region of the world]]

The idea of Central Asia as a distinct region of the world was introduced in 1843 by the geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. The borders of Central Asia are subject to multiple definitions. Many text books still refer to this area as [[Turkestan]], which was the name used prior to Stalin's rule.

The most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]] that defined the "Middle Asia" as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]], but did not include [[Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Mongolia]]. This definition was also often used outside the USSR in this period. 

However, the [[Russian language]] has two distinct terms: Средняя Азия (''Srednyaya Aziya'' or "Middle Asia", the narrower definition which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, "Central Asian" lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and Центральная Азия (''Tsentral'naya Aziya'' or "Central Asia", the wider definition which includes "Central Asian" lands that have never been part of historical Russia). However, there lacks a meaningful distinction between the two in the [[English language]]; and so "Central Asia" is used for both Russian usages, thus creating some confusion.

Soon after independence, the leaders of the five former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Central Asian Republics]] met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.

The [[UNESCO]] general history of Central Asia, written just before the collapse of the USSR, defines the region based on climate and uses far larger borders. According to it, Central Asia includes [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], northeast [[Iran]] ([[Golestān Province|Golestan]], [[North Khorasan Province|North Khorasan]], and [[Razavi Khorasan Province|Razavi]] provinces), Afghanistan, [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Northern Areas]] and the [[N.W.F.P.]] province of Pakistan, Kashmir and Ladakh divisions of [[Jammu & Kashmir]], central-east Russia south of the [[Taiga]], and the former Central Asian [[Soviet]] Republics (the five "Stans" of the former [[Soviet Union]]). 

An alternative method is to define the region based on ethnicity, and in particular, areas populated by Eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], Eastern [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], or [[Mongols|Mongolian]] peoples. These areas include [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], the Turkic regions of southern [[Siberia]], the five republics, and [[Afghan Turkestan]]. Afghanistan as a whole and Northern Areas of Pakistan may also be included. The [[Tibetans]] and [[Ladakhi]] are also included. Insofar, the mentioned peoples are considered the "indigenous" peoples of the vast region.

There are several places that claim to be the geographic center of Asia, for example [[Kyzyl]], the capital of the [[Tuvan Republic]] in the [[Russian Federation]], and a village {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} North of [[Urumqi]], [[Xinjiang]], [[China]].<ref>[http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710 43°40'52"N 87°19'52"E] Degree Confluence Project.</ref>

==Geography==

From the northwest, the mountain climate (purple) extends from the [[Caucasus]], through [[Iran]]ian [[Azerbaijan]], along the Iranian border, through [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]] and into [[Tibet]] in the southeast. The steppe climate (peach) extends from the North Caucasus in the northwest, over the [[Caspian Sea]], through [[Kazakhstan]], and around [[Mongolia]] in the northeast. The arid climates of the [[Fergana|Ferghana Valley]], [[Takla Makan]] and [[Gobi]] deserts are also prominently visible. The labels refer to the [[Trewartha climate classification scheme]].

Central Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kara Kum]], [[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogenous geographical zone known as the [[Euro-Asian Steppe]].

Much of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77° east, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116°–118° east.

Central Asia has the following geographic extremes:
* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50°18' north.
* The [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern Hemisphere's]] southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46°17' north.
* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.

A majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.

Major rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]] and the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west/central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]]. 

Both of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia, and can lead to rather significant international disputes.

===Climate===
Since Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are more severe.

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biome]] in Central Asia is the [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[Deserts and xeric shrublands]] and [[Temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.

==History==
{{main|History of Central Asia}}
[[Image:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|right|160px|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC. [[Scythia]] (mostly [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]) is shown in orange.]]
[[Image:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|130px|A [[Scythian]] horseman from the general area of the [[Ili river]], [[Pazyryk]], c.[[300 BCE]].]]
The history of Central Asia is defined by the area's climate and geography. The aridness of the region made agriculture difficult and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus few major cities developed in the region, instead the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].

Relations between the steppe [[nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent peoples in the world, only limited by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved, was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force, and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols]</ref>

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref>C.E. Bosworth, "The Appearance of the Arabs in Central Asia under the Umayyads and the establishment of Islam", in ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', Vol. IV: The Age of Achievement: AD 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century, Part One: The Historical, Social and Economic Setting, edited by M. S. Asimov and C. E. Bosworth. Multiple History Series. Paris: UNESCO Publishing, 1998. excerpt from page 23: "Central Asia in the early seventh century, was ethnically, still largely an Iranian land whose people used various Middle Iranian languages.</ref> Among the ancient sedentary [[Iranian peoples]], the [[Sogdian]]s and [[Khwarezmian language|Chorasmians]] played an important role, while Iranian peoples such as [[Scythians]] and the later on [[Alans]] lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle.

The main migration of [[Turkic peoples]] occurred between the 5th and 10th centuries, when they spread across most of Central Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.

The dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the nineteenth century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] the Central Asian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. However Afghanistan remained independent of any influence by the Russian empire.

The Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much industrialization and construction of infrastructure, but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems. Soviet authorities [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] millions of people, including entire nationalities,<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/minorities/USSR/Deported-Nationalities.html Deported Nationalities]</ref> from western areas of the USSR to Central Asia and [[Siberia]].<ref>[http://www.anneapplebaum.com/gulag/intro.html Anne Applebaum – Gulag: A History Intro]</ref>

With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] five countries gained independence. In nearly all the new states former Communist Party officials retained power as local strongmen. None of the new republics could be considered functional democracies in the early days of independence, although it appears [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] have made great strides. Other parts of Central Asia remain part of China or Russia.

==Culture==
[[Image:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|170px|Blue-eyed Central Asian and East-Asian Buddhist monks, [[Bezeklik]], 9th-10th century.]]
===Religions===<!-- This section is linked from [[Kashgar]] -->
[[Islam]] is the religion most common in the [[Central Asian Republics]], [[Afghanistan]], Xinjiang and the peripheral western regions, such as [[Bashkiria]]. Most Central Asian Muslims are [[Sunni]], although there are sizeable [[Shia Islam|Shia]] minorities in Afghanistan. [[Hinduism]] is the religion most prevalent in northwest [[India]] although there is a considerable presence of [[Islam]]. 

There are also sizeable minorities of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan and Afghanistan.Although the area that spans over Indian Punjab is a Predominantly [[Sikh]] area. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is most common in Tibet, Mongolia, and the southern Russian regions of Siberia, where [[Shamanism]] is also popular. Increasing [[Han Chinese]] migration westward since the establishment of the PRC has brought [[Confucianism]] and other beliefs into the region. 

[[Nestorianism]] was the form of Christianity most practiced in the region in previous centuries, but now the largest denomination is the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], with many members in Kazakhstan. The [[Bukharian Jews]] were once a sizable community in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, but nearly all have emigrated since the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the revival of [[Islam]] in the region.

===Arts===
[[Image:Yama the Lord of Death.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]], the Lord of Death.]]
At the crossroads of Asia, shamanist practices live alongside [[Buddhism]]. Thus [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism in particular influenced Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong]] Emperor of China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist, and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.

Note the human skulls and severed heads that festoon Yama's crown and necklace, which give some concept of the size that Yama was expected to be when one faced him at one's death.
This particular [[Dharmapala]] is painted wood, four feet high in total.

Central Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] which is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They will engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]—in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed ''[[komuz]]'' and in Kazakhstan a similar two-stringed instrument. 

Some also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates. A 2005 [[Washington Post]] article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of akyns and modern [[freestyle rap]] performed in the West.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html «In Central Asia, a Revival of an Ancient Form of Rap - Art of Ad-Libbing Oral History Draws New Devotees in Post-Communist Era» by Peter Finn, Washington Post Foreign Service, Sunday, March 6, 2005, p. A20.]</ref>

==Demographics==
[[Image:Central Asia Ethnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ethnolinguistic patchwork of Central Asia]]
By the most inclusive definition, more than 80 million people live in Central Asia, about 2% of Asia's total population. Of the regions of Asia, only [[North Asia]] has fewer people. It has a population density of 9 people per km², vastly less than the 80.5 people per km² of the continent as a whole.

===Languages===
<!-- ''[[Central Asian Languages|Main Article]]'' -->

The languages of the majority of the inhabitants of the former [[Soviet]] [[Central Asian Republics]] come from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language group]].<ref>[http://www.hunmagyar.org/turan/ethno.html Ethnographic maps]</ref> [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], closely related to [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (they are both members of the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] group of Turkic), is mainly spoken in [[Turkmenistan]] and into [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] and [[Tatar language|Tatar]] are related languages of the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] group of Turkic languages, and are spoken throughout [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and into [[Afghanistan]], [[Xinjiang]] and [[Qinghai]]. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are spoken in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Xinjiang]].

[[Russian language|Russian]], as well as being spoken by around six million ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] of Central Asia,<ref>Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], [[23 November]] [[2005]].</ref> is a [[lingua franca]] throughout the former [[Soviet]] [[Central Asian Republics]]. [[Chinese language|Mandarin Chinese]] has an equally dominant presence in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Qinghai]] and [[Xinjiang]].

The [[Turkic languages]] belong to the much larger, but [[controversial]] [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language family, which includes [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]. Mongolian is spoken throughout the region of [[Mongolia]] and into Inner Mongolia, [[Qinghai]] and [[Xinjiang]].

[[East Iranian languages]] were once spoken throughout Central Asia, but the once prominent [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarezmian]], [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] and [[Scythian language|Scythian]] languages are now extinct. However, the East Iranian [[Pashto language|Pashto]] is still spoken in [[Afghanistan]] and northwestern [[Pakistan]], and other minor East Iranian languages, such as [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Munji language|Munji]], [[Ishkashimi language|Ishkashimi]], [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]] and [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]] are also spoken in various places in Central Asia. Varieties of [[Persian language|Persian]] are also spoken in the region, locally known as [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Darī]] (in Afghanistan), [[Tajik language|Tojikī]] (by Tajiks in Tajikistan), and [[Bukhori language|Bukhori]] (by the [[Bukharan Jews]] in [[Bukhara]]).

The [[Tibetan language]] is spoken by around six million people across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and into [[Qinghai]] and [[Sichuan]].

[[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], an [[Indo-European]] language, was once spoken in [[Xinjiang]] and parts of [[Tokharistan|Afghanistan]], but is now extinct.

==Geostrategy==
{{Main|Geostrategy in Central Asia}}

Central Asia has long been a strategic location merely because of its proximity to several great powers on the Eurasian landmass. The region itself never held a dominant stationary population, nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers, than as a power in its own right.

Central Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.
[[Image:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Political cartoon from the period of the [[The Great Game|Great Game]] showing the Afghan Amir Sher Ali with his "friends" Imperial Russia and the United Kingdom (1878)]]
* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North, and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.
* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia. Manchu Qing dynasty would conquer [[Uyghurstan]]/[[East Turkistan]] and Tibet. As part of the Sino-Soviet bloc, China would keep Tibet. However, with the Sino-Soviet split, China would project power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.
* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the Hindu Kush, and slightly beyond. Several historical Indian dynasties, especially those seated along the Indus river would expand into Central Asia. India's ability to project power into Central Asia although has been limited due to the mountain ranges in Pakistan (and the country itself, which has somewhat advanced greater into the affairs of the overall region), as well as the cultural differences between Hindu India, and what would become a mostly Muslim Central Asia. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.
* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the Southern areas of Central Asia (usually, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well.

In the post-Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:
* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs, although as other countries move into the area Russia's influence has slowly waned, yet they are still the dominant power.
* China, already controlling Xinjiang and Tibet, projects significant power in the region, especially in energy/oil politics (for example, through the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]]).
* Turkey exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and its involvement in the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]]. Political and economic relations are growing rapidly (e.g. Turkey recently eliminated visa requirements for citizens of the Central Asian Turkic republics).
* Iran, the seat of historical empires which controlled parts of Central Asia, has historical and cultural links to the region, and is vying to construct an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.
* [[Pakistan]], a nuclear-armed Islamic state helped to sustain Taliban rule in Afghanistan, and is termed capable of exercising influence. For some Central Asian nations, the shortest route to the ocean lies through Pakistan. Pakistan seeks [[Natural Gas]] from Central Asia, and supports the development of pipelines from its countries.
* And the United States with its military involvement in the region, and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

===War on Terror===
In the context of the United States' [[War on Terror]], Central Asia has once again become the center of geostrategic calculations. Pakistan's status has been upgraded by the U.S.-government to [[Major non-NATO ally]] because of its central role in serving as a staging point for the invasion of Afghanistan, providing intelligence on Al-Qaeda operations in the region, and leading the hunt on Osama bin Laden, believed to still be in the region. 

Afghanistan, which had served as a haven and source of support for Al-Qaeda, under the protection of Mullah Omar and the [[Taliban]], was the target of a [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion]] in 2001, and ongoing reconstruction and drug-eradication efforts. U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.

Western observers and governments have claimed that Russia, China and the former Soviet republics have taken advantage of the War on Terror to increase oppression of certain ethnic groups, including minority separatist movements, as well as some religious groups. Washington, which considers Russia and China as strategic partners in the War on Terror, has largely turned a blind eye to these claims.

|  Peshawar is the capital of the [[North-West Frontier Province]] of Pakistan, located on the edge of the [[Khyber Pass]] near the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] border. In ancient times, a major settlement called ''Purushpur'' ([[Sanskrit]] for "city of men") was established by [[Kanishka]], the [[Kushans|Kushan]] king, in the general area of modern Peshawar. Purushpur emerged as a major center of Buddhist learning, and the capital of the ancient [[Gandhara]] was moved to Peshawar in the 2nd century CE. During much of its history, Peshawar was one of the main trading centres on the ancient [[Silk Road]] and was a major crossroads for various cultures between Central Asia, [[South Asia]] and the [[Middle East]].

| The second largest city in Iran and one of the holiest cities in the [[Shia]] world. At the beginning of the 9th century (3rd century AH) Mashhad was a small village called Sanabad situated 24&nbsp;km away from [[Tus]]. It was not considered a great city until [[Mongol raids]] in [[1220]] which caused the destruction of many large cities in the [[Greater Khorasan]] territories, leaving Mashhad relatively intact. Thus the survivors of the massacres migrated to Mashhad.<ref name="Zabeth 1999 pp. 14-15">Zabeth (1999) pp. 14-15</ref>
