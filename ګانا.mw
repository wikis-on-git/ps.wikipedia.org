The '''Republic of Ghana''' is a nation in [[West Africa]]. It borders the [[عاج ساحل|Ivory Coast]] to the west, [[بورکينا فاسو]] in the north and [[توګو]] to the east. It was inhabited in pre-colonial times by a number of ancient kingdoms, including an inland Ashanti kingdom and various Fante states along the coast. Trade with European states flourished after contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century, and the British established a crown colony, Gold Coast, in 1874. Ghana became independent in 1957. [[Accra]] is the capital and largest city. The country's population in 2005 was 21,029,853. It was the first African country to obtain its independence from Britain.

== Name ==
Upon achieving independence from the [[United Kingdom]], the name "Ghana" was chosen for the new nation—a reference to the [[Ghana Empire]] of earlier centuries. This name is mostly symbolic, as the ancient Empire of Ghana was located to the north and west of current-day Ghana. The name was adopted as a reference to the descendants of the ancient Empire of Ghana who migrated south and east and currently reside in Ghana.

== History ==
:''Main article: [[History of Ghana]]''
Formed from the merger of the British colony [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and the [[British Togoland]] trust territory by a U.N. sponsored plebiscite, Ghana in [[1957]] became the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. A long series of coups ended with the ascension to power of [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Jerry Rawlings]] in 1981. His changes resulted in the suspension of the constitution in [[1981]] and the banning of political parties. A new constitution, restoring multiparty politics, was approved in [[1992]], and [[Rawlings]] was elected in free elections of that year and also in 1996. The constitution prohibited him from running for a third term. [[John Agyekum Kufuor|John Kufuor]], the current president, is now in his second term.

== Politics ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Ghana]]''

Ghana is a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Its head of state is an elected president (currently John Kufuor) with executive powers. The [[Parliament of Ghana]] is [[wiktionary:unicameral|unicameral]] and dominated by two main parties, the [[New Patriotic Party]] and [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]]. [[Kofi Annan]], the current Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]], is from Ghana.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Ghana]]''

Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in [[West Africa]]. Even so, Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and technical assistance. [[Gold]], [[timber]], and [[cocoa]] production are major sources of foreign exchange. 

The domestic economy continues to revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 40% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] and employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-97, Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment program in cooperation with the [[IMF]]. On the minus side, public sector wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the [[cedi]], and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity measures.

== Administrative Divisions ==
''Main article: [[Regions of Ghana]], [[Districts of Ghana]]''

Ghana is divided into 10 [[region]]s, which are then subdivided into a total of 138 [[district]]s. To see more detailed maps, see either the [[Regions of Ghana]] or the [[Districts of Ghana]]. The districts of Ghana are as follows:

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Ghana Map.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Map of Ghana]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Ghana]]''

Ghana is located on the [[Gulf of Guinea]], only a few degrees north of the [[Equator]]. It is roughly the size of the state of [[Oregon]]. The coastline is mostly a low, sandy shore backed by plains and scrub and intersected by several rivers and streams. A tropical rain forest belt, broken by heavily forested hills and many streams and rivers, extends northward from the shore. North of this belt, the land is covered by low bush, park-like savanna, and grassy plains.

The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]]. The eastern coastal belt is warm and comparatively dry (see [[Dahomey Gap]]); the southwest corner, hot and humid; and the north, hot and dry. [[Lake Volta]], the largest reservoir in the world, extends through large portions of eastern Ghana.

The capital is [[Accra]]....

== Culture ==
[[دوتنه:kenteweaving.jpg|right|thumb|320px|A man weaves kente cloth using a traditional loom in Bonwire (a village) in Ashanti region, Ghana.]]

Perhaps the most visible (and most marketable) cultural contribution from modern Ghana is ''[[Kente]]'' cloth, which is widely recognized and valued for its colors and symbolism. Kente cloth is made by skilled Ghanaian weavers, and the major weaving centers in and around [[Kumasi]] (Bonwire is known as the home of Kente, though areas of [[Volta]] Region also lay claim to the title) are full of weavers throwing their shuttles back and forth as they make long strips of Kente. These strips can then be sewn together to form the larger wraps which are worn by some Ghanaians (chiefs especially) and are purchased by tourists in [[Accra]] and Kumasi. The colors and patterns of the Kente are carefully chosen by the weaver and the wearer. Each symbol woven into the cloth has a special meaning within Ghanaian culture. 

Kente is one of the symbols of the Ghanaian [[chieftaincy]], which remains strong throughout the south and central regions of the country, particularly in the areas populated by members of the culturally- and politically-dominant [[Ashanti]] tribe. The Ashanti's chief, known as the Asantehene, is perhaps the most revered individual in the central part of the country. Like other Ghanaian chiefs, he wears bright Kente, gold bracelets, rings and [[amulets]], and is always accompanied by numerous ornate umbrellas (which are also a symbol of the chieftaincy itself). The most sacred symbol of the Ashanti people is the Golden Stool, a small golden [[throne]] in which the spirit of the people is said to reside. It is kept in safekeeping in Kumasi, the cultural capital of the Ashanti people and the seat of the Asantehene's palace. Though the chieftaincy across Ghana has been weakened by allegations of corruption and cooperation with colonial oppression, it remains a very vital institution in Ghana.

[[دوتنه:Larabanga.jpg|left|thumb|350px|The Larabanga Mosque in Larabanga, Ghana is one of the oldest Mosques in West Africa.]]
Because of its location, the northern regions of Ghana exhibit cultural ties with other Sahelian countries such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and northern [[Nigeria]]. Although not being indigenous tribes to the area, there is strong [[Hausa]] and [[Mande]] influence in the culture of the northern Ghanaian peoples. The dominant tribe in this part of Ghana are the [[Dagomba]]. Northern Ghanaians are known for their traditional long flowing robes and distinct musical styles from southern and central regions. A speciality of food from this region which has successfully become a staple across Ghana is Tuo Zaafi, which is made from pounded rice. The Larabanga mosque in Larabanga is the oldest mosque in Ghana and one of the oldest in West Africa, dating from the 12th century. It is an excellent example of the [[Sudanese Architecture]] style, of which other examples include the [[Djenne]] mosque in [[Mali]] and the Grand Mosque in [[Agadez]], Niger. 

After Independence, the Ghanaian music scene flourished, particularly the up-tempo, danceable style known as ''[[high life]]'', which is still played consistently at the local clubs and bars, often called ''spots''. Many Ghanaians are adept drummers, and it is not unusual to hear traditional drum ensembles play at social events or performances.

== Education ==
Ghana has 12,630 primary schools, 5,450 junior secondary schools, 503 senior secondary schools, 21 training colleges, 18 technical institutions, two diploma-awarding institutions and five universities serving a population of 18 million; this means that most Ghanaians have relatively easy access to good education. In contrast, at the time of independence in 1957, Ghana had only one university and a handful of secondary and primary schools. In the past decade, Ghana's spending on education has been between 28 percent and 40 percent of its annual budget. 

Primary and middle school education is free and will be mandatory when enough teachers and facilities are available to accommodate all students. Pupils are enrolled in a nursery school and kindergarten prior to their 6-year primary education at age six. Under educational reforms implemented in 1987, they pass into a new junior secondary school system for 3 years of academic training combined with technical and vocational training, where they pass a Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE).

Those wishing to continue with their education move into the 3-year senior secondary school program. Entrance to universities is by examination following completion of senior secondary school. School enrollment totals almost 2 million: 1.3 million primary; 107,600 middle; 48,900 secondary; 21,280 technical; 11,300 teacher training; and 5,600 university. 

There is currently an on-going educational reform in Ghana, and teaching is mainly in English, Ghana's official language.
