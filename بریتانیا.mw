The '''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' (usually shortened to the '''United Kingdom''', or the '''UK''') occupies part of the [[British Isles]] in northwestern [[Europe]], with most of its territory and population on the island of [[Great Britain]]. It shares a land border with the [[د آيرلېنډ جمهوريت]] on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]] and is otherwise surrounded by the [[North Sea]], the [[English Channel]], the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[Irish Sea]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
<!--END NOTICE-->

The United Kingdom, often referred to as "[[Britain]]", is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[unitary state]] composed through a [[political union]] of four constituent entities: the three [[Constituent Countries|constituent countries]] of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] (known as the [[Home Nation]]s) on Great Britain, and the [[province]] of [[Northern Ireland]] on the island of Ireland. The UK has several [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]], including [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], and through [[the Crown]] has a constitutional relationship with the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. The UK has close relationships with the fifteen other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, which share the same monarch as [[head of state]].

The UK has a highly [[developed country|developed economy]], the fourth-largest in the world (as measured in terms of [[Gross domestic product]]. It is one of the most populous member states of the [[European Union]] and a founding partner of both the [[United Nations|UN]] (with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]) and [[NATO]]. The UK is also one of the major [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapon states]].

{{main|Economy of the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom, a leading trading power and financial centre, has an essentially capitalist economy, the fourth largest in the world in terms of market [[exchange rate]]s and the sixth largest by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) exchange rates. Over the past three decades, the government has greatly reduced public ownership by means of [[privatisation]] programmes, and has contained the growth of the [[Welfare State]].

[[Agriculture]] is intensive, highly mechanised, and efficient by European standards, producing about 70% of [[food]] needs with only 1% of the labour force. The UK has large [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves; primary energy production accounts for 10% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], one of the highest shares of any industrial state.

Services, particularly [[banking]], [[insurance]] and business services, account for by far the largest proportion of GDP. Industry continues to decline in importance, although the UK is still Europe's largest manufacturer of armaments, petroleum products, personal computers, televisions, and mobile telephones. [[Tourism in the United Kingdom|Tourism]] is also important: with over 24 million tourists a year, the United Kingdom is [[World Tourism Rankings|ranked]] as the sixth major tourist destination in the world, between [[People's Republic of China|China]] (33) and [[Austria]] (19.1).
The [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government has put off the question of participation in the [[Euro]] system, citing [[five economic tests]] that would need to be met before they recommend that the UK adopts the Euro, and hold a [[referendum]].

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Executive (government)|executive power]] exercised on behalf of the [[British monarchy|Queen]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and other [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] ministers who head [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|departments]]. The cabinet, including the Prime Minister, and other [[political minister|ministers]] collectively make up [[Her Majesty's Government]]. These ministers are drawn from and are responsible to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the legislative body, which is traditionally considered to be "supreme" (that is, able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors). The UK is one of the few countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]], relying instead on customs and separate pieces of [[constitutional law]].

While the monarch is [[Head of State]] and theoretically holds all executive power, it is the Prime Minister who is the [[head of government]]. The government is answerable chiefly to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the Prime Minister is drawn from this chamber of Parliament by constitutional convention. The majority of cabinet members will be from the House of Commons, the rest from the [[House of Lords]]. Ministers do not, however, legally have to come from Parliament, though that is the modern day custom. The British system of government has been emulated around the world - a legacy of the United Kingdom's [[colonialism|colonial past]] - most notably in the other [[Commonwealth Realms]]. The Prime Minister is chosen as the MP who can command a majority in the House of Commons - usually the leader of the largest party or, if there is no majority party, the largest coalition. The current Prime Minister is [[Tony Blair]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who has been in office since 1997.

In the United Kingdom the monarch has extensive theoretical powers, but his or her role is mainly, though not exclusively, ceremonial. The monarch is an integral part of Parliament (as the "[[Crown-in-Parliament]]") and theoretically gives Parliament the power to meet and create legislation. An [[Act of Parliament]] does not become law until it has been signed by the Queen (known as [[Royal Assent]]), although no monarch has refused assent to a bill that has been approved by Parliament since [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708). Although the abolition of the monarchy has been suggested several times, the popularity of the monarchy remains strong in spite of recent controversies. Support for a [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|British republic]] usually fluctuates between 15% and 25% of the population, with roughly 10% undecided or indifferent [http://www.mori.com/mrr/2000/c000616.shtml]. The current monarch is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] who acceded to the throne in 1952 and was crowned in 1953.

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is the national legislature of the United Kingdom. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom, according to the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] (however, questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the U.K's entry in to the European Union). It is [[bicameral]], composed of the elected [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the unelected [[House of Lords]], whose members are mostly appointed. The House of Commons is the more powerful of the two houses. The House of Commons houses 646 members who are directly elected from single-member constituencies based on population. The House of Lords has 724 members (though this number is not fixed), constituted of [[hereditary peers]], life peers, and bishops of the [[Church of England]]. The Church of England is the [[established church]] of the state in England.

[[دوتنه:houses.of.parliament.overall.arp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Palace of Westminster]], on the banks of the [[River Thames]]]]

Since the 1920s, the two largest political parties in British politics have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of Parliamentary politics, the [[Plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post]] electoral system used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]] tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are the third major party in the UK parliament and actively seek a reform of the electoral system to address the dominance of the two-party system.

Though many in the United Kingdom consider themselves 'British' as well as 'Welsh', 'English', 'Scottish' or 'Irish' (and increasingly also 'Afro-Caribbean', 'Indian' or 'Pakistani'), there has long been a widespread sense of separate national identities in the nations of Wales and Scotland and amongst the Catholic community in Northern Ireland. Independence for the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1922 provided only a partial solution to what had been termed in the 19th Century the 'Irish Question', and competing demands for a [[united Ireland]] or continued union with Great Britain have brought civil strife and political instability up to the present day.

Though 'nationalist' (as opposed to 'unionist') tendencies have shifted over time in Scotland and Wales, with the [[Scottish National Party]] founded in 1934 and [[Plaid Cymru]] (the Party of Wales) in 1925, a serious political crisis threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom as a state has not occurred since the 1970s. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and government alongside that for the United Kingdom. However, this increased [[autonomy]] and [[devolution]] of executive and legislative powers has not contributed to a reduction in support for [[independence]] from the UK, with the rise of new pro-independence parties: for example the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]].

The contradictions the [[West Lothian Question]] places upon the state may yet prove to be considerable. There is currently little appetite, outside of smaller parties such as the [[English Democrats]], for a [[devolved English parliament]], although senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have voiced support. Proposals for English [[English regions|regional]] government have stalled, following a disastrous referendum on devolved government for the [[North East England|North-East of England]], which was hitherto considered the region most in favour of the idea. England is therefore governed according to the balance of parties across the whole of the United Kingdom.

The well-received resurgence in [[Modern Celts|Celtic]] (Welsh, Scottish, Irish and [[Cornwall|Cornish]]) cultures and languages, as well as 'regional' politics and development, have contributed to the forces pulling against the unity of the state. However, there is at present little sign of any imminent 'crisis' (at the last [[UK General Election 2005|General Election]], both the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] saw their percentage of the overall vote drop, though the SNP did gain two more seats). In Northern Ireland there has been a large drop in violence over the last twenty years, though the situation remains tense, with the more hardline parties, such as [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Democratic Unionist]]s, now holding the most parliamentary seats.

The United Kingdom contains some of the world's leading universities, including the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of London]] (which incorporates, amongst others, [[King's College London]], [[Imperial College London]], The [[London School of Economics]] and [[University College London]]). It has produced many great scholars, scientists and engineers including Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Adam Smith]], [[James Clark Maxwell]], [[Lord Kelvin]], and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]; the nation is credited with many inventions including the [[locomotive]], [[vaccination]], [[television]], the [[railway]], and both the [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] and the [[jet engine]].

In 2006, it was reported that the UK was the most productive source of research after the United States; with the UK producing, for instance, 9% of the world's scientific research papers with a 12% share of citations [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1736095,00.html].

In the UK, there are two types of schools, [[Public Schools]] and [[State Schools]]. Public schools are typically funded by the individual whom attends it, making it a more popular choice among the more wealthy citizens. State schools, however, are funded by the government through [[Tax]].

{{main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}

The [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Scotland]] function as the official national religions in their respective countries, but most religions found in the world are represented in the United Kingdom. [[Anglicanism]] is the state religion that has been established in England since 1534 during the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. During his reign, England broke ties with the Roman Catholic Church and established the [[Church of England]] as the official religion of England. Reforms to the nature of the church's relationship to the state have been ongoing, especially concerning the nature of the [[House of Lords]] and the appointment of a fixed amount of the lordships going to Lords Spiritual, Bishops of the [[Church of England]].

The biggest minority religion of the UK is Islam, holding around 1.6 million members (2.7%). There are over 560,000 Hindus, 500,000 Sikhs, and 320,000 Jewish in Great Britain. Most world religions are represented in the United Kingdom.
