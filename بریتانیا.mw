The '''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' (usually shortened to the '''United Kingdom''', or the '''UK''') occupies part of the [[British Isles]] in northwestern [[Europe]], with most of its territory and population on the island of [[Great Britain]]. It shares a land border with the [[د آيرلېنډ جمهوريت]] on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]] and is otherwise surrounded by the [[North Sea]], the [[English Channel]], the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[Irish Sea]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
<!--END NOTICE-->

The United Kingdom, often referred to as "[[Britain]]", is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[unitary state]] composed through a [[political union]] of four constituent entities: the three [[Constituent Countries|constituent countries]] of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] (known as the [[Home Nation]]s) on Great Britain, and the [[province]] of [[Northern Ireland]] on the island of Ireland. The UK has several [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]], including [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], and through [[the Crown]] has a constitutional relationship with the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. The UK has close relationships with the fifteen other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, which share the same monarch as [[head of state]].

The UK has a highly [[developed country|developed economy]], the fourth-largest in the world (as measured in terms of [[Gross domestic product]]. It is one of the most populous member states of the [[European Union]] and a founding partner of both the [[United Nations|UN]] (with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]) and [[NATO]]. The UK is also one of the major [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapon states]].

==تاريخ==
{{main|History of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:ActsOfUnion1707-Painting.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Parliamentary Union of England and Scotland 1707'', painting by Walter Thomas Monnington.]]

The present United Kingdom is the latest of several [[union]]s formed over the last 840 years. [[Scotland]] and [[England]] have existed as separate political entities since the 9th century. [[Wales]], under the control of English monarchs from the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284, became part of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]]. With the [[Act of Union 1707]], the independent states of England and Scotland, having been in [[personal union]] since 1603, agreed to a political union as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. 

The [[Act of Union 1800]] united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been gradually brought under English control between 1169 and 1691, to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Independence for the now [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1922 brought the [[partition]] of the island of Ireland, with six of the nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]] remaining within the UK, which changed to the current name in 1929 in recognition.

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The British Empire in 1897.]]
The United Kingdom, the dominant industrial and maritime power of the 19th century, played a leading role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of property, liberty, [[capitalism]] and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]—to say nothing of its part in advancing world literature and science. At its zenith, the [[British Empire]] stretched over one quarter of the [[Earth]]'s surface and encompassed a third of its population - making it the largest empire in history. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted from the effects of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous nation.

The UK has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 1973. The attitude of the present government towards further integration is conservative, with the [[official opposition]] favouring a return of some powers and competencies to the UK. It has not chosen to adopt the [[Euro]] as domestic political opinion runs strongly against such a move, whilst the government itself has not seen fit to advance membership based on a judgement of the economic costs and benefits in doing so.

==جغرافيه==
[[Image:Uk-map.png|thumb|230px|left|A [[United States]] [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]] Map of the United Kingdom]]
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom}}

Most of England consists of rolling lowland terrain, divided east from west by more mountainous terrain in the Northwest ([[Cumbrian Mountains]] of the [[Lake District]]) and north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]]) and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]] by the [[Tees-Exe line]]. The lower [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]], [[Lincolnshire]] and [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[Thames]], [[Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. The largest urban area is [[Greater London]]. Near [[Dover, England|Dover]], the [[Channel Tunnel]] links the United Kingdom with France. There is no peak in England that is 1,000 metres (3,300 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) or greater.

Scotland's geography is varied, with [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]] in the south and east and [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]] in the north and west, including [[Ben Nevis]], the UK's highest mountain at 1,344 metres (4,408 ft). There are many long and deep-sea arms, [[firth]]s, and [[loch]]s. A multitude of islands west and north of Scotland are also included, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. The capital city is [[Edinburgh]], the centre of which is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The largest city is [[Glasgow]].

Wales is mostly mountainous, the highest peak being [[Snowdon]] at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft) above sea level. North of the mainland is the island of [[Anglesey]]. The largest and capital city is [[Cardiff]], located in South Wales.

Northern Ireland, making up the north-eastern part of Ireland, is mostly hilly. The main cities are [[Belfast]] ('Béal Feirste' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) and [[Londonderry]] / [[Derry]] ('Doire' in [[Irish language|Irish]]). The province is home to one of the UK’s [[World Heritage Sites]], the [[Giant's Causeway]], which consists of more than 40,000 six-sided basalt columns up to 40 feet (12 m) high. [[Lough Neagh]], the largest body of water in the [[British Isles]], by surface area (388&nbsp;km²&nbsp;/&nbsp;150&nbsp;mi²), can be found in Northern Ireland.

In total it is estimated that the UK includes around 1,098 small islands, some being natural and some being [[crannog]]s, a type of [[artificial island]] which was built in past times using stone and wood, gradually enlarged by natural waste building up over time.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the United Kingdom}}

At the April [[2001 UK Census]], the United Kingdom's population was 58,789,194, the third-largest in the [[European Union]] (behind [[Germany]] and [[France]]) and the twenty-first largest in the world. This had been estimated up to 59,834,300 by the [[Office of National Statistics]] in [[2004]]. Its overall population density is one of the highest in the world. Almost one-third of the population lives in England's prosperous south-east and is predominantly urban and suburban--with about 7.2 million in the capital of London. The United Kingdom's high literacy rate (99%) is attributable to universal public education introduced for the primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900 (except in Scotland where it was introduced in 1696). Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen. 

[[Image:Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester.jpg|thumb|Piccadilly Gardens, one of Manchester's main public squares]]

A group of islands close to continental Europe, the British Isles have been subject to many invasions and migrations, especially from Scandinavia and the continent, including Roman occupation for several centuries. Contemporary Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic stocks that settled there before the eleventh century. The pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse influences were blended on Great Britain under the Normans, Scandinavian Vikings who had lived in Northern France.

==اقتصاد==
[[Image:1pound2000front.jpg|left|frame|One-pound coin]]
{{main|Economy of the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom, a leading trading power and financial centre, has an essentially capitalist economy, the fourth largest in the world in terms of market [[exchange rate]]s and the sixth largest by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) exchange rates. Over the past three decades, the government has greatly reduced public ownership by means of [[privatisation]] programmes, and has contained the growth of the [[Welfare State]].

[[Agriculture]] is intensive, highly mechanised, and efficient by European standards, producing about 70% of [[food]] needs with only 1% of the labour force. The UK has large [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves; primary energy production accounts for 10% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], one of the highest shares of any industrial state.

Services, particularly [[banking]], [[insurance]] and business services, account for by far the largest proportion of GDP. Industry continues to decline in importance, although the UK is still Europe's largest manufacturer of armaments, petroleum products, personal computers, televisions, and mobile telephones. [[Tourism in the United Kingdom|Tourism]] is also important: with over 24 million tourists a year, the United Kingdom is [[World Tourism Rankings|ranked]] as the sixth major tourist destination in the world, between [[People's Republic of China|China]] (33) and [[Austria]] (19.1).
The [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government has put off the question of participation in the [[Euro]] system, citing [[five economic tests]] that would need to be met before they recommend that the UK adopts the Euro, and hold a [[referendum]].

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Executive (government)|executive power]] exercised on behalf of the [[British monarchy|Queen]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and other [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] ministers who head [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|departments]]. The cabinet, including the Prime Minister, and other [[political minister|minister]]s collectively make up [[Her Majesty's Government]]. These ministers are drawn from and are responsible to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the legislative body, which is traditionally considered to be "supreme" (that is, able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors). The UK is one of the few countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]], relying instead on customs and separate pieces of [[constitutional law]].

While the monarch is [[Head of State]] and theoretically holds all executive power, it is the Prime Minister who is the [[head of government]]. The government is answerable chiefly to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the Prime Minister is drawn from this chamber of Parliament by constitutional convention. The majority of cabinet members will be from the House of Commons, the rest from the [[House of Lords]]. Ministers do not, however, legally have to come from Parliament, though that is the modern day custom. The British system of government has been emulated around the world - a legacy of the United Kingdom's [[colonialism|colonial past]] - most notably in the other [[Commonwealth Realms]]. The Prime Minister is chosen as the MP who can command a majority in the House of Commons - usually the leader of the largest party or, if there is no majority party, the largest coalition. The current Prime Minister is [[Tony Blair]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who has been in office since 1997.

In the United Kingdom the monarch has extensive theoretical powers, but his or her role is mainly, though not exclusively, ceremonial. The monarch is an integral part of Parliament (as the "[[Crown-in-Parliament]]") and theoretically gives Parliament the power to meet and create legislation. An [[Act of Parliament]] does not become law until it has been signed by the Queen (known as [[Royal Assent]]), although no monarch has refused assent to a bill that has been approved by Parliament since [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708). Although the abolition of the monarchy has been suggested several times, the popularity of the monarchy remains strong in spite of recent controversies. Support for a [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|British republic]] usually fluctuates between 15% and 25% of the population, with roughly 10% undecided or indifferent [http://www.mori.com/mrr/2000/c000616.shtml]. The current monarch is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] who acceded to the throne in 1952 and was crowned in 1953.

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is the national legislature of the United Kingdom. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom, according to the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] (however, questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the U.K's entry in to the European Union). It is [[bicameral]], composed of the elected [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the unelected [[House of Lords]], whose members are mostly appointed. The House of Commons is the more powerful of the two houses. The House of Commons houses 646 members who are directly elected from single-member constituencies based on population. The House of Lords has 724 members (though this number is not fixed), constituted of [[hereditary peers]], life peers, and bishops of the [[Church of England]]. The Church of England is the [[established church]] of the state in England.

[[Image:houses.of.parliament.overall.arp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Palace of Westminster]], on the banks of the [[River Thames]]]]

Since the 1920s, the two largest political parties in British politics have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of Parliamentary politics, the [[Plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post]] electoral system used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]] tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are the third major party in the UK parliament and actively seek a reform of the electoral system to address the dominance of the two-party system.

Though many in the United Kingdom consider themselves 'British' as well as 'Welsh', 'English', 'Scottish' or 'Irish' (and increasingly also 'Afro-Caribbean', 'Indian' or 'Pakistani'), there has long been a widespread sense of separate national identities in the nations of Wales and Scotland and amongst the Catholic community in Northern Ireland. Independence for the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1922 provided only a partial solution to what had been termed in the 19th Century the 'Irish Question', and competing demands for a [[united Ireland]] or continued union with Great Britain have brought civil strife and political instability up to the present day.

Though 'nationalist' (as opposed to 'unionist') tendencies have shifted over time in Scotland and Wales, with the [[Scottish National Party]] founded in 1934 and [[Plaid Cymru]] (the Party of Wales) in 1925, a serious political crisis threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom as a state has not occurred since the 1970s. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and government alongside that for the United Kingdom. However, this increased [[autonomy]] and [[devolution]] of executive and legislative powers has not contributed to a reduction in support for [[independence]] from the UK, with the rise of new pro-independence parties: for example the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]].

The contradictions the [[West Lothian Question]] places upon the state may yet prove to be considerable. There is currently little appetite, outside of smaller parties such as the [[English Democrats]], for a [[devolved English parliament]], although senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have voiced support. Proposals for English [[English regions|regional]] government have stalled, following a disastrous referendum on devolved government for the [[North East England|North-East of England]], which was hitherto considered the region most in favour of the idea. England is therefore governed according to the balance of parties across the whole of the United Kingdom.

The well-received resurgence in [[Modern Celts|Celtic]] (Welsh, Scottish, Irish and [[Cornwall|Cornish]]) cultures and languages, as well as 'regional' politics and development, have contributed to the forces pulling against the unity of the state. However, there is at present little sign of any imminent 'crisis' (at the last [[UK General Election 2005|General Election]], both the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] saw their percentage of the overall vote drop, though the SNP did gain two more seats). In Northern Ireland there has been a large drop in violence over the last twenty years, though the situation remains tense, with the more hardline parties, such as [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Democratic Unionist]]s, now holding the most parliamentary seats.

===Subdivisions===
{{main|Subdivisions of the United Kingdom}}
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
The United Kingdom is divided into four constituent parts, commonly referred to as the [[home nations]]:
*[[England]]
*[[Scotland]]
*[[Northern Ireland]]
*[[Wales]]
{{col-2}}
The constituent parts of the United Kingdom have administrative<br>[[subnational entity|subdivisions]] as follows:
*The [[Regions of England|regions]] and [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]] of [[England]]
*The [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council areas]] of [[Scotland]]
*The [[Districts of Northern Ireland|districts]] of [[Northern Ireland]]
*The [[Unitary Authorities of Wales|counties and county boroughs]] of [[Wales]]
{{col-end}}
The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]] incorporated Wales and England into [[England and Wales]] for legal purposes.

Although all four have historically been divided into [[Traditional counties of the British Isles|counties]], England's population is an order of magnitude larger than the others so in recent years it has for some purposes been divided into nine intermediate-level [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]]. Each region is made up of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[unitary authorities]], apart from [[London]], which consists of [[London borough]]s. Although at one point it was intended that each or some of these regions would be given its own regional assembly, the plan's future is uncertain, [[as of 2004]], after the North East region rejected its proposed assembly in a referendum.

Scotland consists of 32 Council Areas. Wales consists of 22 Unitary Authorities, styled as 10 County Boroughs, 9 Counties, and 3 Cities. Northern Ireland is divided into 26 Districts.

Also sometimes associated with the United Kingdom, though not constitutionally part of the United Kingdom itself, are the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]] (the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], and the [[Isle of Man]]) as self-governing possessions of [[the Crown]], and a number of [[Crown colony|overseas territories]] under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.

{{main|British Armed Forces}}

The [[armed force]]s of the United Kingdom are known as the ''British Armed Forces'' or ''Her Majesty's Armed Forces'', officially the ''Armed Forces of the Crown''. Their [[Commander-in-Chief]] is the [[British monarch|Queen]] and they are managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].

[[Image:Triserv-600.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Tri-service badge of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. The anchor representing the Royal Navy, the crossed swords the Army, and the Eagle the Royal Air Force]]
The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the United Kingdom and its overseas territories, promoting the United Kingdom's wider security interests, and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in [[NATO]] and other coalition operations. The United Kingdom fields one of the most powerful and comprehensive military forces in the World. Its global [[power projection]] capabilities are second only to those of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. 

The [[British Army]] had a reported strength of 102,440 in 2005 and the [[Royal Air Force]] a strength of 49,210. The 36,320-member [[Royal Navy]] is in charge of the United Kingdom's independent strategic nuclear arm, which consists of four [[Vanguard class submarine|Trident Ballistic Missile Submarines]], while the [[Royal Marines]] provide infantry units for amphibious assault and for specialist reinforcement forces in and beyond the [[NATO]] area. This puts total active duty military troops in the 190,000 range, currently deployed in over 80 countries. 9% of the regular Armed Forces are women, a figure that is higher still for the reserve forces.

The UK's Special Forces, principally the [[Special Air Service|SAS]], provide elite commandos trained for quick, mobile, military responses; often where secrecy or covert operations are required. The [[Royal Navy]] is the second largest navy in the World in terms of gross tonnage. Despite the United Kingdom's wide ranging capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that any large operation would be undertaken as part of a coalition. Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq ([[Operation Granby|''Granby'']], No-Fly-Zones, [[Operation Desert Fox|''Desert Fox'']] and [[Operation Telic|''Telic'']]) may all be taken as precedent - indeed the last true war in which the British military fought alone was the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, in which military action was initiated by Argentina and the United Kingdom was fighting a defensive, rather than offensive, campaign.

The United Kingdom contains some of the world's leading universities, including the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of London]] (which incorporates, amongst others, [[King's College London]], [[Imperial College London]], The [[London School of Economics]] and [[University College London]]). It has produced many great scholars, scientists and engineers including Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Adam Smith]], [[James Clark Maxwell]], [[Lord Kelvin]], and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]; the nation is credited with many inventions including the [[locomotive]], [[vaccination]], [[television]], the [[railway]], and both the [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] and the [[jet engine]].

In 2006, it was reported that the UK was the most productive source of research after the United States; with the UK producing, for instance, 9% of the world's scientific research papers with a 12% share of citations [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1736095,00.html].

In the UK, there are two types of schools, [[Public Schools]] and [[State Schools]]. Public schools are typically funded by the individual whom attends it, making it a more popular choice among the more wealthy citizens. State schools, however, are funded by the government through [[Tax]].

{{main|Languages in the United Kingdom}}

The predominant language of the United Kingdom is [[English language|English]], which is a West Germanic language descended from Old English, featuring a large amount of borrowings from Norman French. The English language has spread to all corners of the world (primarily because of the British Empire) and is referred to as a "global language". It is taught as a second language more than any other around the world. 

Other indigenous languages include [[Celtic languages]] such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the closely related [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scots Gaelic]], and the [[Cornish language]]. Addition languages are [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], which is closely related to [[English language|English]]; [[Romany language|Romany]]; and [[British Sign Language]] ([[Northern Ireland Sign Language]] is also used in Northern Ireland). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for many centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep. The United Kingdom's other languages are also spoken by small groups across the world, including Welsh in [[Argentina]] and [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] in [[Canada]].

Recent immigrants, especially from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], speak many other languages, including [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali]], and [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]]. The United Kingdom has the largest number of Hindi-speaking peoples outside of the Indian subcontinent.

{{main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}

The [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Scotland]] function as the official national religions in their respective countries, but most religions found in the world are represented in the United Kingdom. [[Anglicanism]] is the state religion that has been established in England since 1534 during the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. During his reign, England broke ties with the Roman Catholic Church and established the [[Church of England]] as the official religion of England. Reforms to the nature of the church's relationship to the state have been ongoing, especially concerning the nature of the [[House of Lords]] and the appointment of a fixed amount of the lordships going to Lords Spiritual, Bishops of the [[Church of England]].

The biggest minority religion of the UK is Islam, holding around 1.6 million members (2.7%). There are over 560,000 Hindus, 500,000 Sikhs, and 320,000 Jewish in Great Britain. Most world religions are represented in the United Kingdom.

{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|right|thumb|Tennis originated in the UK. The [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament is held in London every July ]]
A great number of major sports originated in the United Kingdom, including [[association football]] (soccer), [[rugby football]] (rugby), [[golf]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]] and [[boxing]].

The national sport of the UK is [[Football (soccer)|association football]], but the UK does not compete as a nation in any major football tournament. Instead, the home nations compete individually as [[England national football team|England]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. It is because of this unique four-team arrangement that the UK currently does not compete in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. However, a united team will probably take part in the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]], as these are hosted in London. The English and Northern Irish football associations have confirmed participation in this team while the Scottish FA and the Welsh FA have declined to participate.

The UK also hosts many world-renowned football clubs, such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in England and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in Scotland. Clubs compete in [[Football in the United Kingdom|national leagues and competitions]] and some go on to compete in European competitions.

British teams are generally successful in European Competitions, including the following European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United]] (twice), [[Nottingham Forest]] (twice), [[Aston Villa]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby League]] originates from and is generally played in the North of England, whilst [[Rugby Union]] is played all over Britain. In [[Rugby League]] the UK plays as one nation - [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] - whilst in union it is represented by the four nations. England is the current holder of the Rugby Union World Cup. Every four years the [[British and Irish Lions]] (comprising the best players from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland) tour other countries.

The [[Wimbledon Championships]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are seen as the most prestigious of the tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred racing]] is also very popular in England. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" - and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]] and the [[Epsom Derby]]

Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the UK, and [[St Andrews]] in Scotland is the sport's home course. Cricket is also popular; although the popularity of the game is dramatically greater in England than the remainder of the UK, all four constituent nations [[as of 2006]] compete at the One-Day International level - Scotland independently, Wales as part of the English team, and Northern Ireland as part of All-Ireland.

[[Gaelic football]] is the most popular sport in [[Northern Ireland]] with the counties of [[Tyrone]] and [[Armagh]] forming part of the 'Big Three' (along with [[Kerry]]).

The country is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] and [[World Rally Championship|Rallying]] are based in the UK. The country also hosts legs of F1 and World Rallying Championship calendars and has its own [[Touring Car Racing]] championship, the [[BTCC]].

British winners of the Formula One World Championship include [[Mike Hawthorn]], [[Graham Hill]] (twice), [[Jim Clark]] (twice), [[John Surtees]] (who was also successful on motorcycles), [[Jackie Stewart]] (three times), [[James Hunt]], [[Nigel Mansell]], and Graham Hill's son, [[Damon Hill]]. British drivers have not been as successful in the World Rally Championship, with only [[Colin McRae]] and the late [[Richard Burns]] winning the title.
