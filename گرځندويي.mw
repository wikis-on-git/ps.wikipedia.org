'''Tourism''' is the act of [[travel]] for predominantly [[recreation]]al or [[leisure]] purposes, and also refers to the provision of services in support of this act. According to the [[World Tourism Organization]], '''tourists''' are people who "travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited". 

Tourism, however long its incident duration, has become an extremely popular, global activity. In 2004, there were over 763 million international tourist arrivals.<ref name="number">{{cite web | year = 2005| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/facts/eng/pdf/indicators/Top25_ita.pdf  | title = World's top 25 tourist destinations| publisher = World Tourism}}</ref>

As a [[service industry]], tourism has numerous tangible and intangible elements. Major tangible elements include [[transport]]ation, accommodation, and other components of a [[hospitality industry]]. Major intangible elements relate to the purpose or motivation for becoming a tourist, such as rest, relaxation, the opportunity to meet new people and experience other cultures, or simply to do something different and have an adventure.

Tourism is vital for many countries, due to the income generated by the consumption of goods and services by tourists, the taxes levied on businesses in the tourism industry, and the opportunity for employment and economic advancement by working in the industry. For these reasons [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and government agencies may sometimes promote a specific region as a tourist destination, and support the development of a tourism industry in that area. The contemporary phenomenon of mass tourism may sometimes result in [[overdevelopment]], however alternative forms of tourism such as [[ecotourism]] seek to avoid such outcomes by pursuing tourism in a [[sustainability|sustainable]] way. 

The terms ''tourism'' and ''travel'' are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms ''tourism'' and ''tourist'' are sometimes used pejoratively to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited by tourists.

==Definition, classification and prerequisites==
===ټولګړی پېژند===
One of the earliest definitions of tourism was provided by the Austrian economist [[Hermann Von Schullard]] in [[1910]], who defined it as, "sum total of operators, mainly of an economic nature, which directly relate to the entry, stay and movement of foreigners inside and outside a certain country, city or a region."

Hunziker and Krapf, in [[1941]], defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity."<ref name="1941define">{{cite book | title= Grundriss der allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre | author=Werner Hunziker and Kurt Krapf | id=<small>OCLC # 69064371| year = 1941}}</ref> 

In [[1976]] Tourism Society of England defined it as "Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destination outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes."

In [[1981]] [[AIEST|International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism]] defined Tourism in terms of particular activities selected by choice and undertaken outside the home environment.

===د ملګرو ملتونو تعريف===
United Nations classified 3 forms of tourism in 1994 in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics as follows:
  
#	Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country;
#	Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country;
#	Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country.

UN also derived different categories of tourism by combining the 3 basic forms of tourism:

#	Internal tourism, which comprises domestic tourism and inbound tourism;
#	National tourism, which comprises domestic tourism and outbound tourism;
#	International tourism, which consists of inbound tourism and outbound tourism.

===نوي تعريف===
Intrabound tourism is a new academic terminology coined by the [[Korea tourism organization]] and widely accepted in Korea. Intrabound tourism differs from ‘domestic tourism’ in that the former is more dynamic and comprehensive, encompassing policy-making and implementation of national tourism policies in consideration of the tourism ecosystem consisting of inbound, outbound and intrabound tourism. 

Entering into 21st century, the tourism industry has undergone a paradigm shift form the promotion of inbound tourism to the promotion of intrabound tourism since many countries are experiencing a tough competition for inbound tourists.  Also realizing that it is impossible to advance the inbound tourism in the absence of active intrabound tourism, national policy makers have shifted their policy priority onto the promotion of intrabound tourism such as the promotion of local tourism to contribute to the local economy. 

Examples of such policies are “See America,” “Getting Going Canada,” and “See Korea Campaign”. Taking a Korean case as an example, Korea Tourism Organization has recently launched a nation-wide campaign to promote introbound bourism, named “Guseok Guseok, literally meaning corner to corner..

===Prerequisites of tourism===
Before people are able to experience tourism they usually need at least:

# [[disposable income]], i.e. money to spend on non-essentials
# leisure time
# tourism [[infrastructure]], such as transport and accommodation

Individually, sufficient [[health]] is also a condition, and of course the inclination to travel. Furthermore, in some countries there are legal restrictions on travelling, especially abroad. Certain states with strong governmental control over the lives of citizens (notably established  [[Communist state]]s) may restrict foreign travel only to trustworthy citizens. The [[United States]] prohibits its citizens from traveling to some countries, for example, [[Cuba]].

Wealthy people have always travelled to distant parts of the world to see great buildings or other works of art, to [[multilingualism|learn new languages]], to experience new cultures, or to taste new [[cuisine]]. As long ago as the time of the [[Roman Republic]] places such as [[Baiae]] were popular coastal resorts for the rich.

The terms ''tourist'' and ''tourism'' were first used as official terms in [[1937]] by the [[League of Nations]]. Tourism was defined as people travelling abroad for periods of over 24 hours.

===Health tourism & leisure travel===

[[Image:Peru_Machu_Picchu_Sunrise.jpg|200px|thumb|left|View of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]]]]

The history of European tourism can perhaps be said to originate with the medieval [[pilgrimage]]. Although undertaken primarily for religious reasons, the pilgrims in the [[Canterbury Tales]] quite clearly saw the experience as a kind of [[holiday]] (the term itself being derived from the 'holy day' and its associated leisure activities). Pilgrimages created a variety of tourist aspects that still exist - bringing back souvenirs, obtaining credit with foreign banks (in medieval times utilising international networks established by Jews and Lombards), and making use of space available on existing forms of transport (such as the use of medieval English wine ships bound for Vigo by pilgrims to Santiago De Compostela). Pilgrimages are still important in modern tourism - such as to [[Lourdes]] or [[Knock]] in Ireland. But there are modern equivalents - [[Graceland]] and the grave of [[Jim Morrison]] in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

During the seventeenth century, it became fashionable in England to undertake a [[Grand Tour]]. The sons of the [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] were sent upon an extended tour of Europe as an educational experience. The eighteenth century was the golden age of the Grand Tour, and many of the fashionable visitors were painted at Rome by [[Pompeo Batoni]]. A modern equivalent of the Grand Tour is the phenomenon of the [[backpacker]], although cultural holidays, such as those offered by Swann-Hellenic, are also important.

Health tourism has always existed, but it was not until the [[eighteenth century]] that it became important. In England, it was associated with [[spa town|spa]]s, places with supposedly health-giving [[mineral water]]s, treating diseases from [[gout]] to [[liver]] disorders and [[bronchitis]]. [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] was the most fashionable resort, but [[Buxton]], [[Harrogate]], and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], amongst others, also flourished. Of course, people visited these places for the balls and other entertainments, just as much as 'the waters'. Continental Spas such as [[Karlsbad]] attracted many fashionable travellers by the [[nineteenth century]].

It could be argued that Britain was the home of the seaside holiday. In travelling to the coast, the population was following in the steps of Royalty. [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] made regular visits to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] when in poor health. At the time, a number of doctors argued the benefits of bathing in sea water, and sea bathing as a widespread practice was popularised by the [[Prince Regent]] (later [[George IV]]), who frequented [[Brighton]] for this purpose. 

[[Image:ValleColca lou.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Colca Canyon]] in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]]]

Leisure travel was associated with the [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] of [[United Kingdom]] &ndash; the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, the factory owners, and the traders. These comprised the new [[middle class]]. [[Cox & Kings]] were the first official travel company to be formed in 1758. Later, the [[working class]] could take advantage of leisure time.

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. At [[Nice]], one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the [[French Riviera]], the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the ''Promenade des Anglais''; in many other historic resorts in [[continental Europe]], old well-established palace hotels have names like the ''Hotel Bristol'', the ''Hotel Carlton'' or the ''Hotel Majestic'' - reflecting the dominance of [[England|English]] customers.

===Winter tourism===
[[Winter sport]]s were largely invented by the British leisured classes, initially at the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] village of [[Zermatt]] ([[Valais]]), and [[St Moritz]] in [[1864]]. The first [[Henry Simpson Lunn|packaged winter sports holidays]] took place in [[1902]] at [[Adelboden]], Switzerland. Winter sports were a natural answer for a leisured class looking for amusement during the coldest season.

Organized sport was well established in Britain before it reached other countries. The vocabulary of sport bears witness to this: [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[football (soccer)|football]], and [[boxing]] all originated in Britain, and even [[tennis]], originally a French sport, was formalized and codified by the British, who hosted the first national championship in the nineteenth century, at [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]]. 

===Mass travel===
'''Mass travel''' could only develop with two crucial features:

# improvements in technology allowed the [[transport]] of large numbers of people in a short space of time to places of leisure interest, and
# greater numbers of people began to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

The pioneer of modern mass tourism was [[Thomas Cook]] who, on [[5 July]] [[1841]], organized the first [[package tour]] in history. He arranged for the [[Midland Counties Railway|rail company]] to charge one [[shilling]] per person for a group of 570 [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] campaigners from [[Leicester]] to a rally in [[Loughborough]], eleven miles away. Cook was paid a share of the fares actually charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. There had been railway excursions before, but this one included entrance to an entertainment held in private grounds, rail tickets and food for the train journey. Cook immediately saw the potential of a convenient 'off the peg' holiday product in which everything was included in one cost. He organised packages inclusive of accommodation for the [[Great Exhibition]], and afterwards pioneered [[package holiday]]s in both Britain (particularly in Scotland) and on the European continent (where Paris and the Alps were the most popular destinations). 

He was soon followed by others (the [[Lunn Poly|Polytechnic Touring Association]], Dean and Dawson etc.), with the result that the tourist industry developed rapidly in late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain. Initially it was supported by the growing middle classes, who had time off from their work, and who could afford the luxury of travel and possibly even staying for periods of time in [[boarding house]]s.

The [[Bank Holidays Act 1871]] introduced a statutory right for workers to take holidays, even if they were not paid at the time. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the tradition of the working class holiday had become firmly established in Britain. These were largely focussed upon the seaside resorts.

The spread of the [[railway]] network in the [[nineteenth century]] resulted in the growth of Britain's [[seaside resort|seaside towns]] by bringing them within easy distance of Britain's urban centres. [[Blackpool]] was created by the construction of a line to [[Fleetwood]], and some resorts were promoted by the railway companies themselves - [[Morecambe]] by the [[Midland Railway]] and [[Cleethorpes]] by the [[Great Central Railway]]. Other resorts included [[Scarborough, England|Scarborough]] in [[Yorkshire]], servicing Leeds and Bradford; [[Weston-super-Mare]] in [[Somerset]], catering for the inhabitants of Bristol; and [[Skegness]], patronised by the residents of the industrial East Midlands. The [[cockneys]] of [[London]] flocked to  [[Southend-on-Sea]], mainly by [[River Thames|Thames]] [[Paddle steamer|Steamer]], and the South Coast resorts such as [[Broadstairs]], [[Brighton]], and  [[Eastbourne]] were only a train ride away, with others further afield such as [[Bournemouth]], [[Bognor Regis]] and [[Weymouth]].

For a century, domestic tourism was the norm, with foreign travel being reserved for the rich or the culturally curious. A number of inland destinations, such as the [[English Lake District]], and [[Snowdonia]] appealed to those who liked the countryside and fine scenery. The [[holiday camp]] began to appear in the 1930s, but this phenomenon really expanded in the post-war period. [[Butlins]] and [[Pontins]] set this trend, but their popularity waned with the rise of overseas package tours and the increasing comforts to which visitors became accustomed at home. Towards the end of the [[20th century]] this market has been revived by the upmarket inland resorts of Dutch company [[Center Parcs]].

Cox & Co, the forebear of [[Cox & Kings]] were in existence from 1758 largely entwined with the travel arrangements for the British Army serving around the Empire. While acting as 'agents' for various regiments, they organised the payment, provision, clothing and travel arrangements for members of the armed forces. In the 19th century their network of offices contained a banking and also travel department. The company became heavily involved with affairs in India and its Shipping Agency had offices in France and the Middle East.

Other phenomena that helped develop the travel industry were paid holidays: 
* 1.5 million manual workers in Britain had paid holidays by [[1925]]
* 11 million by [[1939]] (30% of the population in families with paid holidays)

====Outside Britain====
In the [[United States|USA]], the first great seaside resort, in the European style, was [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. 

In Continental Europe, early resorts included [[Ostend]] (for the people of [[Brussels]]), and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] ([[Pas-de-Calais]]) and [[Deauville]] ([[Calvados]]) (for [[Paris]]ians).

===International mass tourism===

Increasing speed on railways meant that the tourist industry could develop internationally.

To this may be added the development of sea travel. By [[1901]], the number of people crossing the [[English Channel]] from England to [[France]] or [[Belgium]] had passed 0.5 million per year. Shipping companies were anxious to fill cabin space that was under utilised. For example, [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] found that the majority of their passengers for India and the Far East joined the ship at Marseilles. Consequently, they marketed holidays based upon sea trips from London to Lisbon and Gibraltar. Other companies diverted their older ships to operate [[cruises]] in the summer months.  

[[Image:Monument of love and symmetry.jpg|thumb|210px|right|More than 3 million tourists visited the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]], [[India]] in [[2004]].]]

[[Image:Costa Rica beach.jpg|thumb|left|A beach in Costa Rica.]]

However, the real age of international mass travel began with the growth of air travel after World War Two. In the immediate post-war period, there was a surplus of transport aircraft, such as the popular and reliable [[Douglas Dakota]], and a number of ex military pilots ready to fly them. They were available for [[charter flights]], and tour operators began to use them for European destinations, such as Paris and Ostend.

[[Vladimir Raitz]] pioneered modern package tourism when on [[20 May]] [[1950]] his recently founded company, Horizon, provided arrangements for a two-week holiday in [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Corsica]]. For an all inclusive price of £32.10s.-, holiday makers could sleep under canvas, sample local wines and eat a meal containing meat twice a day - this was especially attractive due to the continuing [[Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II|austerity measures]] in post-war United Kingdom. Within ten years, his company had started mass tourism to [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]] (1952), [[Lourdes]] (1953), [[Costa Brava]] (1954), [[Alghero|Sardinia]] (1954), [[Minorca]] (1955), [[Porto]] (1956), [[Costa Blanca]] (1957) and [[Costa del Sol]] (1959).

However it was with cheap [[airliner|air]] travel in combination with the package tour that international mass tourism developed.
The postwar introduction of an international system of [[airline regulation]] was another important factor. The bilateral agreements at the heart of the system fixed seat prices, and airlines could not fill blocks of empty seats on underused flights by discounting. But if they were purchased by a tour operator and hidden within the price of an inclusive holiday package, it would be difficult to prove that discounting had taken place - even though it was obvious that it had! This was the origin of the modern mass package tour.

These developments coincided with a significant increase in the standard of living in Britain. At the end of the 1950s, [[Harold Macmillan]] could say "you've never had it so good."

Another significant development also happened at the end of this decade. The devaluation of the [[Spanish peseta]] made [[Spain]] appear a particularly attractive destination. The cheapness of the cost of living attracted increasing numbers of visitors. Mass package tourism has at times been an exploitative process, in which tour operators in a country with a high standard of living make use of development opportunities and low operating costs in a country with a lower standard of living. However, as witness the development of many tourist areas in previously poor parts of the world, and the concomitant rise in standards of living, when there is equality of bargaining power, both parties can gain economic benefits from this arrangement.

[[Spain]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] became major tourist destinations, and development probably peaked in the 1980s. At the same time, British tour operators developed the [[Algarve]] in [[Portugal]]. The continuing search for new, cheaper, destinations spread mass tourism to the [[Greek Islands]], [[Italy]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], parts of the coast of [[Turkey]], and more recently [[Croatia]].

For the worker living in greater [[London]], [[Venice]] today is almost as accessible as [[Brighton]] was 100 years ago. Consequently, the British seaside resort experienced a marked decline from the 1970s onwards. Some, such as [[New Brighton, Merseyside]] have disappeared. Others have reinvented themselves, and now cater to daytrippers and the weekend break market.

== Recent developments ==
[[Image:Touristic countries.svg|thumb|right|350px|Most visited countries in 2001]]
There has been a discernible upmarket trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe where international travel for short breaks is commonplace. Tourists have higher levels of disposable income and greater leisure time. They are also better educated and have more sophisticated tastes. There is now a demand for a better quality product in many quarters. This has resulted in the following trends:-
* The old 'sun, sea, and sand' mass market has fragmented. People want more specialised versions of it, such as 'Club 18 -30', quieter resorts with select hotels, self-catering, etc. 
* People are taking second holidays in the form of short breaks/city breaks, ranging from British and European cities to country hotels. 
* There has been a growth in niche markets catering for special interests or activities, including growth of [[destination hotel]]s. 
The developments in technology and transport infrastructure (particularly the advent of jumbo jets) have placed some types of holiday in the affordable mainstream:-
* The development of a mass cruise holiday market.
* The advent of affordable holidays to long-haul destinations such as Thailand or Kenya. 
* The phenomenon of the low budget airline, utilising a new generation of small regional airports.
There have also been changes in lifestyle, which may call into question the current definitions of tourism. Some people (particularly the 45+ and retired) may be adopting a tourism lifestyle, living as a tourist all the year round - eating out several times a week, going to the theatre, daytripping, and indulging in short breaks several times a year.

Much of this results in impulse purchasing. This is facilitated by internet purchasing of tourism products. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor- made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as Bali and European cities. Some of the tourist destinations, including the Costa del Sol, the Baleares and Cancún have lost popularity due to shifting tastes. In this context, the excessive building and environmental destruction often associated with traditional "sun and beach" tourism may contribute to a destination's saturation and subsequent decline. This appears to be the case with Spain's Costa Brava, a byword for this kind of tourism in the 1960s and 1970s. With only 11% of the Costa Brava now unblemished by low-quality development (Greenpeace Spain's figure), the destination now faces a crisis in its tourist industry.

Sustainable tourism is becoming more popular as people start to realize the devastating effects tourism can have on communities.

Receptive tourism is now growing at a very rapid rate in many developing countries, where it is often the most important economic activity in local GDP.

In recent years, second holidays or vacations have become more popular as people's discretionary income increases. Typical combinations are a package to the typical mass tourist resort, with a winter skiing holiday or weekend break to a city or national park.

On December 26, 2004 a tsunami, caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] hit Asian countries bordering the Indian Ocean, and also the Maldives. Tens of thousands of lives were lost, and many tourists died. This, together with the vast clean-up operation in place, has stopped or severely hampered tourism to the area.

==Special forms of tourism==
For the past few decades other forms of tourism, also known as '''niche tourism''', have been becoming more popular, particularly:
* ''[[Adventure tourism]]'': tourism involving travel in rugged regions, or adventurous sports such as [[mountaineering]] and [[hiking]] ([[tramping]]).
* ''[[Agritourism]]'': farm based tourism, helping to support the local agricultural economy.
* ''Ancestry tourism'': (also known as genealogy tourism) is the travel with the aim of tracing one's ancestry, visiting the birth places of these ancestors and sometimes getting to know distant family.
* ''[[Armchair tourism]]'' and  ''[[virtual tourism]]'': not travelling physically, but exploring the world through internet, books, TV, etc. 
* ''Audio tourism'': includes ''[[audio walking tours]]'' and other audio guided forms of tourism including museum audio guides and audio travel books.
* ''[[Bookstore Tourism]]'' is a grassroots effort to support independent bookstores by promoting them as a travel destination.
* ''[[Creative Tourism]]'' is a new form of tourism that allows  visitors to develop their creative potential, and get closer to local people, through informal participation in hands-on workshops that draw on the culture of their holiday destinations.
* ''[[Cultural tourism]]'': includes [[Urbanization|urban]] tourism, visiting historical or interesting cities, and experiencing their cultural heritages. This type of tourism may also include specialized cultural experiences, such as art museum tourism where the tourist visits many art museums during the tour, or opera tourism where the tourist sees many operas or concerts during the tour.
* ''[[Coastal Tourism]]'' involves tourist products located along Coastal Environments - due to the limited extent of coastal environments they often are amongst the first places to experience coastal tourist congestion for a region.
* ''[[Dark tourism]]'': is the travel to sites associated with death and suffering.  The first tourist agency to specialise in this kind of tourism started with trips to Lakehurst, New Jersey, the scene of the [[Hindenburg (airship)|Hindenburg airship disaster]].
* ''[[Disaster tourism]]'': travelling to a disaster scene not primarily for helping, but because it is interesting to see. It can be a problem if it hinders rescue, relief and repair work. 
* ''[[Drug tourism]]'': travel to a country to obtain or consume drugs, either legally or illegally.
* ''[[Ecotourism]]'': sustainable tourism which has minimal impact on the environment, such as [[safari]]s ([[Kenya]]), [[Rainforests]] ([[Belize]]) and [[hiking]] ([[Lapland]]), or [[national park]]s.
* ''Educational tourism'': may involve travelling to an education institution, a wooded retreat or some other destination in order to take personal-interest classes, such as cooking classes with a famous chef or crafts classes.
*''[[Extreme tourism]]'': tourism associated with high risk.
*''[[Free Independent Traveler]]'': a sector of the market and philosophy of constructing a vacation by sourcing one's own components eg accommodation, transport.
* ''[[Gambling tourism]]'', e.g. to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Macau]] or [[Monte Carlo]] for the purpose of gambling at the [[casino]]s there.
* ''[[Garden tourism]]'' visiting [[botanical garden]]s famous places in the [[history of gardening]], such as [[Versailles]] and the [[Taj Mahal]].
* ''[[Heritage tourism]]'': visiting historical ([[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Cracow]])  or industrial sites, such as old [[canal]]s, [[railway]]s, battlegrounds, etc.
* ''[[Health tourism]]'': usually to escape from cities or relieve stress, perhaps for some 'fun in the sun', etc. Often to [[Sanatorium]]s or "health spas".
* ''Hobby tourism'': tourism alone or with groups to participate in hobby interests, to meet others with similar interests, or to experience something pertinent to the hobby. Examples might be [[garden]] tours, [[amateur radio]] [[DX-pedition]]s, or [[square dance]] cruises.
* ''Inclusive tourism'': tourism marketed to those with functional limits or disabilities. Referred to as "Tourism for All" in some regions. Destinations often employ Universal Design and Universal Destination Development principles.
*''[[Mass Tourism]] is an [[ecotourism]] policy to minimise the [[ecological footprint|footprint]] of tourists by concentrating them into a small area. Mass tourism also maximises the ultisation of tourist infrastructure.
* ''[[Medical tourism]]'', e.g.:
**for what is illegal in one's own country, such as [[abortion]] or [[euthanasia]]
**for advanced care that is not available in one's own country
**in the case that there are long waiting lists in one's own country
**for use of free or cheap health care organisations
* ''[[Pop-culture tourism]]'': tourism by those that visit a particular location after reading about it or seeing it in a film.
* ''[[Perpetual traveler|Perpetual tourism]]'': individuals always on vacation; some of them, for tax purposes, to avoid being resident in any country.
* ''[[Pilgrimage]] Tourism'': pilgrimages to ancient holy places ([[Rome]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]] for Catholics, temples and stupas of [[Nepal]] for the Hindus and Buddhist,  [[Mount Athos]] or [[Painted churches of northern Moldavia]] for the Orthodox), religious sites such as [[mosque]]s, [[shrine]]s, etc.
* ''[[Sex tourism]]'': travelling solely for the purpose of sexual activity, usually with prostitutes
* ''[[Shopping tourism]]'' promoting shopping festivals as tourist drawcards such as the [[Dubai Shopping Festival|Dubai]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Gold Coast, Queensland|the Gold Coast]]. 
* ''[[Solo Travel]]'': travelling alone
* ''[[Sport travel]]'': [[skiing]], [[golf]] and [[scuba diving]] are popular ways to spend a vacation. This could also include travelling to a major international sporting event such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] or following a tour such as [[the Ashes]] or [[British and Irish Lions]].
* ''[[Space tourism]]'': traveling in [[outer space]] or on [[spaceships]].
* ''[[Vacilando]]'' is a special kind of wanderer for whom the process of travelling is more important than the destination.
* ''[[Wine tourism]]'', the visiting of [[growing region]]s, [[vineyard]]s, [[winery|wineries]], tasting rooms, wine festivals, and similar places or events for the purpose of consuming or purchasing [[wine]].

==Trends==
The [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4&nbsp;%.<ref name="predict">{{cite web | year = 2004| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm  | title = 
Long-term Prospects: Tourism 2020 Vision | publisher = World Tourism}}</ref> By 2020 [[Europe]] will remain the most popular destination, but its share will drop from 60&nbsp;% in 1995 to 46&nbsp;%. Long-haul will grow slightly faster than intraregional travel and by 2020 its share will increase from 18&nbsp;% in 1995 to 24&nbsp;%.

With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.) can sell their services directly. This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops. 

[[Space tourism]] is expected to "take off" in the first quarter of the [[21st century]], although compared with traditional destinations the number of tourists in orbit will remain low until technologies such as a [[space elevator]] make space travel cheap.

Technological improvement is likely to make possible air-ship hotels, based either on [[solar power|solar-powered]] airplanes or large [[dirigible]]s. Underwater hotels, such as [[Hydropolis]], expected to open in [[Dubai]] in [[2006]], will be built. On the ocean tourists will be welcomed by ever larger cruise ships and perhaps [[floating city|floating cities]].

Some futurists expect that movable hotel "pods" will be created that could be temporarily erected anywhere on the planet, where building a permanent resort would be unacceptable politically, economically or environmentally.
