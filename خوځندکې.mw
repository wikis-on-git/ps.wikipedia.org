'''Insects''' ([[Class (biology)|Class]] '''Insecta''') are [[arthropod]]s, having a hard [[exoskeleton]], a three-part body ([[head]], [[thorax]], and [[abdomen]]), three pairs of jointed [[leg]]s, [[compound eye]]s, and two [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. They are the most diverse group of [[animalia|animals]] on the planet and include approximately 30 [[Notoptera]], 35 ''[[Zoraptera]]'', 150 [[snakefly]], 200 [[Thysanura|silverfish]], 300 [[Megaloptera|alderfly]], 300 [[Embioptera|webspinner]], 350 [[Archaeognatha|jumping bristletail]], 550 [[Mecoptera|scorpionfly]], 600 ''[[Strepsiptera]]'', 1,200 [[Trichoptera|caddisfly]], 1,700 [[Plecoptera|stonefly]], 1,800 [[earwig]], 2,000 [[flea]], 2,200 [[Mantodea|mantis]], 2,500 [[mayfly]], 3,000 [[louse]], 3,000 [[Phasmatodea|walking stick]], 4,000 [[cockroach]], 4,000 [[Neuroptera|lacewing]], 4,000 [[termite]], 5,000 [[dragonfly]], 5,000 [[thrips]], 5,500 [[Psocoptera|booklouse]], 20,000 [[Orthoptera|cricket, grasshopper, and locust]], 82,000 [[Hemiptera|true bug]], 110,000 [[Hymenoptera|ant, bee, sawfly, and wasp]], 120,000 [[Diptera|true fly]], 170,000 [[Lepidoptera|butterfly and moth]], and 360,000 [[Coleoptera|beetle]] species described to date.

The relationship of insects' evolutionary history to that of other animals is unclear, though evidence has emerged indicating that insects and crustaceans may have shared common ancestors. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic Era]], including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 [[centimeter|cm]] (22-28 [[inches|in]]), much larger than any living insect.<ref name="History of Insects">{{cite book|author=[[Alex Rasnitsyn|Rasnitsyn, A.P.]] and Quicke, D.L.J.|title=History of Insects|year=2002|publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]|isbn=1-4020-0026-X}}</ref> Many highly successful insect groups are shown to have [[co-evolution|co-evolved]] with flowering plants.<ref name="Biology-coevolution">{{cite web | title=Coevolution and Pollination | url=http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio303/coevolution.htm | work= | publisher=University of Cincinnati | date= | accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref>

Humans regard many insects as [[Pest (organism)|pests]], and attempt to control them using [[insecticide]]. Some insects are [[parasite|parasitic]], such as [[mosquito]]es and [[lice]], or damaging to agriculture, such as [[locust]]s. Many are capable of transmitting diseases. On the other hand, insects such as [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[bee]]s are beneficial to the environment by engaging in [[pollination]], and insects such as [[silkworm]]s and [[bee]]s produce substances useful to humans. In some parts of the world insects are used for human food, a practice known as [[entomophagy]]. About 1,200 insect species are known to be consumed, although many other countries consider this practice [[taboo]].<ref name="Gullan and Cranston">{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |coauthors=P.S. Cranston |title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |date=2005 |edition=3 |isbn=1-4051-1113-5}}</ref>{{rp|10–13}}

== Body structure ==
Insects possess segmented bodies supported by an [[exoskeleton]], a hard outer covering made mostly of [[chitin]]. The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or [[tagma (biology)|tagmata]]; a head, a [[thorax]], and an [[abdomen]].<ref>{{cite web | title=O. Orkin Insect zoo | url=http://insectzoo.msstate.edu/Students/basic.structure.html | work= | publisher= The University of Nebraska Department of Entomology   		 | date= | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> The head supports a pair of sensory [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], a pair of [[compound eye]]s, if present, one to three simple eyes or ([[ocelli]]) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]]. The thorax has [[6 (number)|six]] segmented [[arthropod leg|legs]] (one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax) and two or four [[insect wing|wings]] (if present in the species). The abdomen (made up of eleven segments some of which may be reduced or fused) has most of the [[digestion|digestive]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive internal structures.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|22–48}}

=== Nervous system ===
The [[nervous system]] of an insect can be divided into a brain and a [[ventral nerve cord]]. The head capsule (made up of six fused segments) has six pairs of [[ganglion|ganglia]]. The first three pairs are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into a structure called the [[subesophageal ganglion]].<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|57}}

The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction.<ref name="INSECTS: ROLE OF THE SPIRACLES">{{cite journal|last=SCHNEIDERMAN |first=HOWARD A.|date=1960|title=DISCONTINUOUS RESPIRATION IN INSECTS: ROLE OF THE SPIRACLES|journal=Biol.

And some, like the house fly ''[[Musca domestica]]'', have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.

Until very recently, no one had ever documented the presence of [[nociceptor]]s (the cells that detect and transmit sensations of [[pain]]) in insects,<ref>C. H. Eisemann, W. K. Jorgensen, D. J. Merritt, M. J. Rice, B. W. Cribb, P. D. Webb and M. P. Zalucki (1984) Do insects feel pain? — A biological view. Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 40: 1420–1423</ref> though recent findings of [[nociception]] in larval [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] challenges this<ref>Tracey, J., W. Daniel, R. I. Wilson, G. Laurent, and S. Benzer (2003) ''painless'', a ''Drosophila'' gene essential for nociception. Cell 113: 261–273. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00272-1</ref> and raises the possibility that some insects may be capable of feeling pain.

=== Digestive system ===

</div>]]

An insect uses its digestive system to extract nutrients and other substances from the food it consumes.<ref name="genent">{{cite web | title=General Entomology - Digestive and Excritory system | url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | work= | publisher=NC state University | date= | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> Most of this food is ingested in the form of [[macromolecule]]s and other complex substances (such as [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]], [[fats]], and [[nucleic acids]]) which must be broken down by [[catabolism|catabolic reactions]] into smaller molecules (i.e. [[amino acid]]s, [[simple sugar]]s, etc.) before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as [[digestion]].

The insect's digestive system is a closed system, with one long enclosed tube called the [[alimentary canal]] which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal only allows food to enter the mouth, and then gets processed as it travels toward the [[anus]]. Each of the three sections of the alimentary canal performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax (adjacent to the fore-gut).<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|70–77}}

The [[salivary glands]] (30) produce saliva, the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the [[salivarium]] behind the [[hypopharynx]]; which movements of the mouthparts help mix saliva with food in the buccal cavity. Saliva mixes with food which travels through salivary tubes into the mouth, beginning the process of breaking it down.<ref name="genent">{{cite web | title=General Entomology – Digestive and Excretory system | url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | work= | publisher=NC state University | date= | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Duncan |first=Carl D. |coauthors= |title=A Contribution to The Biology of North American Vespine Wasps|publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford|date=1939 |edition=1 |pages=24–29|isbn=}}</ref>

[[دوتنه:Malpighian.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stylised diagram of insect digestive tract showing malpighian tubule ([[Orthopteran]] type)]]
The first section of the alimentary canal is the [[fore-gut]] (27) or stomodaeum. In the fore-gut, initial breakdown of large food particles occurs, mostly by saliva. The fore-gut includes the [[Buccal cavity]], the [[esophagus]], and the [[crop]], which stores food before it passes to the [[stomach|mid-gut]].<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|70}}

Once food leaves the crop, it passes to the [[stomach|mid-gut]] (13) or mesenteron. The mid-gut is where digestion really happens, through enzymatic action.<ref>{{cite web | title= The New Penguin Dictionary of Biological| url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/9570812/Biology-Dictionary | work= | publisher= Penguin books | date= | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> Microscopic projections from the mid-gut wall, called [[microvilli]], increase surface area and allow for maximum absorption of nutrients.

In the [[hind-gut]] (16) or proctodaeum, is where undigested food particles join uric acid from [[Malpighian tubule system|Malphigian tubules]] to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs most of the water in this waste matter, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (17), there by completing the process of digestion.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|71–72, 78–80}}

=== Respiration and circulation ===
[[Respiratory system#Anatomy of Respiratory System in Invertebrates|Insect respiration]] is accomplished without [[lung]]s using a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need oxygen (see ''[[invertebrate trachea]]''). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced; it has no closed vessels (i.e., no [[vein]]s or [[artery|arteries]]), consisting of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses [[peristalsis|peristaltically]], and in doing so helps circulate the [[hemolymph]] inside the body cavity.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|61–65}} Air is taken in through [[spiracles]], openings on the sides of the abdomen. There are many different patterns of [[gas exchange]] demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous, [[diffusion|diffusive]] ventilation, to [[discontinuous gas exchange]].<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|65–68}}

=== Exoskeleton ===
[[دوتنه:Insect.png|thumb|330px|Scanning electron micrograph of a [[thrips]] (Thysanoptera), showing fine structure, the compound eyes, wing construction, and setae.]]
Most higher insects have two pairs of [[Insect wing|wings]] located on the second and third thoracic segments.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|38}} Insects are the only [[invertebrate]]s to have developed flight capability, and this has played an important part in their success. [[Insect flight]] is not very well understood, relying heavily on turbulent aerodynamic effects.  The primitive insect groups use muscles that act directly on the wing structure. The more advanced groups making up the [[Neoptera]] have foldable wings and their muscles act on the thorax wall and power the wings indirectly.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|186}} These muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.

Their outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers; the [[epicuticle]] which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin, and another layer under it called the [[procuticle]]. This is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers, the outer being the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each others in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and [[sclerotization|sclerotized]].<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|22–24}} The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially the [[larva]]l stages (e.g., [[caterpillar]]s).

== Reproduction ==
[[دوتنه:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of ''Simosyrphus grandicornis'' hoverflies mating in flight.]]
Most insects hatch from [[egg (biology)|eggs]], but some are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] or [[viviparous]],<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|129, 131, 134–135}} and all undergo a series of [[ecdysis|molts]] as they develop and grow in size. This manner of growth is necessitated by the inelastic exoskeleton. Moulting is a process by which the individual escapes the confines of the exoskeleton in order to increase in size, then grows a new and larger outer covering.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|142}} In some insects, the young are called '''nymphs''' and are similar in form to the adult except that the wings are not developed until the adult stage. This is called ''incomplete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]'' and insects showing this are termed ''[[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]]''. ''[[Holometabolism|Holometabolous]]'' insects show ''complete metamorphosis'', which distinguishes the [[Endopterygota]] and includes many of the oldest and most successful insect groups.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|143}} In these species, an egg hatches to produce a '''[[larva]]''', which is generally worm-like in form, and can be divided into five different forms; eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) and vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a '''[[pupa]]''', a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a [[pupa|cocoon]]. [[دوتنه:Flies mating May 2008-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Muscina sp.|Muscina]] flies mating]]There are three types of pupae; obtect (the pupa is compact with the legs and other appendages enclosed), exarate (where the pupa has the legs and other appendages free and extended) and coarctate (where the pupa develops inside the larval skin).<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|151}} In the pupal stage, the insect undergoes considerable change in form to emerge as an adult, or '''[[imago]]'''.  Butterflies are an example of an insect that undergoes complete metamorphosis. Some insects have even evolved [[hypermetamorphosis]].

Some insects (parastic wasps) show [[polyembryony]] where a single fertilized egg can divide into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|136–137}} Other developmental and reproductive variations include [[haplodiploidy]], [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], [[paedomorphosis]] (metathetely and prothetely), [[sexual dimorphism]], [[parthenogenesis]] and more rarely [[hermaphroditism]].

== Senses and communication ==
[[دوتنه:Common brown robberfly with prey.jpg|thumb|A [[robberfly]] with its prey, a [[hoverfly]]]]
Many insects possess very sensitive and/or specialized organs of [[sense|perception]]. Some insects such as bees can perceive [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, or detect [[polarized light]], while the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] of male moths can detect the [[pheromone]]s of female moths over distances of many kilometres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crazydaz.com/insects.pdf |title=Insects|publisher=Alien Life Forms|pages=4|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice-versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, and it is by no means universal; the general pattern, however, is that if an insect can produce sound, then it can also hear sound, though the range of frequencies they can hear is often quite narrow (and may in fact be limited to only the frequency that they themselves produce). Some nocturnal moths can perceive the [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] emissions of [[bat]]s, a mechanism which helps them avoid predation.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|87–94}} Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey/hosts. Bloodsucking insects have special sensory structures that can detect [[infrared]] emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.
[[دوتنه:SensillaeImms.png|thumb|Sensillae: sensory structures on insects]]

A few such insects also have a well-developed number sense,<ref>{{cite book|last=Möller|first=R. |title=A Biorobotics Approach to the Study of Insect Visual Homing Strategies|editor=BibTeX|date=2002|pages=pg.11|url=http://www.ti.uni-bielefeld.de/downloads/publications/habil.pdf|language=German}}</ref> such as the solitary wasps that provision with a single species of prey. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but it is always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus ''[[Eumenes (genus)|Eumenes]]'' is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell. She can in other words distinguish between both the numbers five and ten in the caterpillars she is providing and which cell contains a male or a female.

=== Light production and vision ===
A few insects, such as members of the families Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), [[Mycetophilidae]] (Diptera), and the beetle families [[Lampyridae]], [[Phengodidae]], [[Elateridae]] and [[Staphylinidae]] are [[bioluminescent]]. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of ''[[Arachnocampa]]'' (Mycetophilidae, Fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Literature review of the New Zealand glowworm ''Arachnocampa luminosa'' (Diptera: Keroplatidae) and related cave-dwelling Diptera|last=Pugsley|first=Chris W.|journal=New Zealand Entomologist|year=1983|volume=7|issue=4|pages=419–424|url=http://www.ento.org.nz/nzentomologist/free_issues/NZEnto07_4_1983/Volume%207-4-419-424.pdf}}</ref> 
Some fireflies of the genus ''[[Photuris]]'' [[mimicry|mimic]] the flashing of female ''[[Photinus]]'' species to attract males of that species, which are then captured and devoured.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Occurrence of Aggressive Mimicry in Fireflies|first=James E.|last=Lloyd|journal=The Florida Entomologist|volume=67|issue=3|year=1984|pages=368–376|doi=10.2307/3494715 }}</ref> The colours of emitted light vary from dull blue (''Orfelia fultoni'', Mycetophilidae) to the familiar greens and the rare reds (''Phrixothrix tiemanni'', Phengodidae).<ref>{{cite book|first=James E.|last=Lloyd|coauthors=Erin C. Gentry|title=in

Most insects except some species of cave dwelling crickets are able to perceive light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes include simple eyes or [[Ocellus|ocelli]] as well as [[compound eye]]s of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet as well as the visible light wavelengths. Colour vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the basic bauplan of UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the [[Devonian]] period.<ref name=insvision>{{cite journal|title=The evolution of color vision in insects|author=Briscoe, AD & L Chittka|year=2001|journal=Annu.

=== Sound production and hearing ===
Insects were the earliest organisms to produce sounds and to sense them. Soundmaking in insects is achieved mostly by mechanical action of appendages. In the [[grasshopper]]s and crickets this is achieved by [[stridulation]]. The [[cicada]]s have the loudest sounds among the insects and have special modifications to their body and musculature to produce and amplify sounds. The African [[cicada]], ''[[Brevisana brevis]]'' has been measured at 106.7 [[decibel]]s at a distance of 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in).<ref name="walker">Walker, T.J., ed. 2001. University of Florida Book of Insect Records, 2001. [http://ufbir.ifas.ufl.edu/]</ref> Some insects, such as the [[hawk moth]]s and [[Hedylidae|Hedylid]] butterflies, can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense detection by bats. Some moths produce ultrasound clicks that were earlier thought to have a role in jamming the bat echolocation, but it was subsequently found that these are produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats, just as [[Aposematism|warning colourations]] are used against predators that hunt by sight.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hristov|first=N.I.|coauthors=Conner, W.E.|year=2005|title=Sound strategy: acoustic aposematism in the bat–tiger moth arms race|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=92|pages=164–169|doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0611-7}}</ref> These calls are also made by other moths involved in [[mimicry]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=J.

Very low sounds are also produced in various species of Neuroptera, [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s), [[Coleoptera]] and [[Hymenoptera]] produced by the mechanical actions of movement often aided by special microscopic stridulatory structures. Most sound-making insects also have [[tympanal organ]]s that can perceive airborne sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted by the substrate. Communication using substrate-borne [[vibration]]al signals is more widespread among insects because of the size constraints in producing air-borne sounds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Virant-Doberlet|first=M.|coauthors=Čokl A.|year=2004|title=Vibrational communication in insects|journal=Neotropical Entomology|volume=33|issue=2|pages=121–134|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ne/v33n2/a01v33n2.pdf|doi=10.1590/S1519-566X2004000200001}}</ref> Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse more in a dense environment (such as [[foliage]]), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bennet-Clark|first=H.C.|year=1998|title=Size and scale effects as constraints in insect sound communication|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B|volume=353|pages=407–419|doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0219}}</ref> The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects. 

Some species use vibrations for communicating within members of the same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the [[shield bug]] ''[[Nezara viridula]]''<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|title=The Influence of Substrate on Male Responsiveness to the Female Calling Song in ''Nezara viridula''|volume=14|issue=3|pages=313–332|year=2001|first=Nadège|last=Miklas|coauthors=Nataša Stritih,Andrej Čokl, Meta Virant-Doberlet, Michel Renou|doi=10.1023/A:1011115111592}}</ref> while it can also be used to communicate between entirely different species, such as between ants and myrmecophilous lycaenid caterpillars.<ref>{{cite journal|last=DeVries|first=P. J.|year=1990|title=Enhancement of symbiosis between butterfly caterpillars and ants by vibrational communication|journal=Science|volume=248|pages=1104–1106|doi=10.1126/science.248.4959.1104|pmid=17733373}}</ref>

The [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]] has the ability to press air through the spiracles to make a hissing noise, and the [[Death's-head Hawkmoth]] makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their [[pharynx]].

=== Chemical communication ===
In addition to the use of sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed [[semiochemical]]s, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|96–105}}

== Social behavior ==
[[دوتنه:Termite Cathedral DSC03570.jpg|thumb|right|A cathedral mound created by termites (Isoptera).]]
[[Social insect]]s, such as [[termite]]s, [[ant]]s and many [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s, are the most familiar species of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] animal.<ref>{{cite web|title= Social insects|last=Brewer|first=Gary|url=http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/entomology/topics/societies.htm|publisher=North Dakota State University|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered [[superorganism]]s. It is sometimes argued that the various species of [[honey bee]] are the only invertebrates (and indeed one of the few non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication (i.e., where a behaviour is used to ''represent'' and convey specific information about something in the environment), called the [[Bee learning and communication|dance language]] – the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|309–311}}

Only those insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing – this can be quite sophisticated, however, and allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimetres in diameter among a mass of thousands of apparently identical holes all clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometres' distance, and (in cases where an insect [[hibernation|hibernates]]) as long as a year after last viewing the area (a phenomenon known as [[philopatry]]). A few insects [[Insect migration|migrate]], but this is a larger-scale form of [[navigation]], and often involves only large, general regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the [[Monarch butterfly]]).

=== Care of young ===
Most insects lead short lives as adults, and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of [[parental care]], where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even actively feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical of bees and various types of wasps.<ref>{{cite web | title=Parental care | url=http://www.geocities.com/brisbane_insects/ParentalCare.htm | work= | publisher=Brisbane Insects and Spiders | date= | accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

== Locomotion ==
=== Flight ===
{{main|Insect flight}}

Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight. The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some proponents suggest that the wings are para-notal in origin while others have suggested they are modified gills. In the Carboniferous age, some of the ''[[Meganeura]]'' dragonflies had as much as a 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere found from ice core-samples was as high as 35% compared to the current 21%. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dudley|first=R.|year=1998|title= Atmospheric oxygen, giant Paleozoic insects and the evolution of aerial locomotor performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=201|issue=8|pages=1043–1050|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/201/8/1043.pdf}}</ref> The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the [[Atlas moth]] and the White Witch (''[[Thysania agrippina]]''). Insect flight has been a topic of great interest in [[aerodynamics]] due partly to the inability of steady-state theories to explain the lift generated by the tiny wings of insects.

Unlike [[bird]]s, insects are swept along by the [[prevailing winds]].<ref>Diana Yates (2008).

=== Walking ===
Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a [[tripedal]] [[gait]]. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking whilst always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in [[cockroach]]es. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, whilst the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on.<ref name="Locomotion">{{cite book|last=Biewener|first=Andrew A|title=Animal Locomotion|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|isbn=0-19-850022-X 
|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref> The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at speed. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits; for example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs. 

Cockroaches are amongst the fastest insect runners and at full speed actually adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move extremely rapidly, they need recording at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is also studied by scientists in stick insects [[Phasmatodea]]. A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, especially the bugs of the family, [[Water strider|Gerridae]], also known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus ''[[Halobates]]'' even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species. 

Insect walking is of particular interest as an alternative form of locomotion to the use of wheels for robots ([[Robot locomotion]]).<ref name="Locomotion">{{cite book|last=Biewener|first=Andrew A|title=Animal Locomotion|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|isbn=0-19-850022-X

=== Swimming ===
[[دوتنه:Notonecta glauca01.jpg|thumb|right|The backswimmer ''[[Notonecta glauca]]'' underwater, showing the paddle like hindleg adaptation]]
A large number of insects live either parts or the whole of their lives underwater. In many of the more primitive orders the immature stages are aquatic while some other groups have aquatic adults as well.<ref name=aquins>{{cite book|author=Richard W. Merritt, Kenneth W. Cummins, and Martin B. Berg (editors)|year=2007|title=An Introduction to the Aquatic Insects of North America|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishers|isbn=9780757550492|edition=4th}}</ref>

Many of these species have adaptations to help in locomotion under water. The water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, forcibly expelling water out of the rectal chamber.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mill|first=P. J.|coauthors=R. S.

They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film.<ref name=aquins /> Other insects such as the [[staphylinidae|Rove beetle]] ''[[Stenus]]'' are known to emit salivary secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni propulsion]] (also known by the [[Germany|German]] term ''Entspannungsschwimmen'').<ref>{{cite journal|last=Linsenmair|first=K.|coauthors=Jander R.|year=1976|title=Das "entspannungsschwimmen" von ''Velia'' and ''Stenus''|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=50|pages=231|doi=10.1007/BF00639292}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=J.

== Evolution ==
[[دوتنه:Insect antennae comparison.jpg|thumb|left|Evolution has produced astonishing variety in insects. Pictured are some of the possible shapes of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].]] 
{{Main|Insect evolution}}
The relationships of insects to other animal groups remain unclear. Although more traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes, evidence has emerged favoring closer [[evolution]]ary ties with the crustaceans. In the [[Pancrustacea]] theory, insects, together with [[Remipedia]] and [[Malacostraca]], make up a natural [[clade]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Palaeos invertebrates:Arthropoda | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Invertebrates/Arthropods/Pancrustacea.html | publisher=Palaeos Invertebrates | date=2002-05-03 | accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

Other terrestrial arthropods, such as [[centipede]]s, [[millipede]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[spider]]s, are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton. However upon closer examination their features differ significantly; most noticeably they do not have the six legs characteristic of adult insects.<ref>{{cite web | title=Evolution of insect flight | url=http://dml.cmnh.org/1994Oct/msg00116.html | publisher=Malcolm W.

The higher level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, a [[Tufts University]] student and a faculty lecturer uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300 million-year-old specimen from the [[Carboniferous Period]]. The scientists presented the fossil at the Second International Congress on Ichnology, in Krakow, Poland in September 2008.<ref>{{cite web | title= Researchers Discover Oldest Fossil Impression of a Flying Insect | url=http://newswise.com/articles/view/545296/ | publisher=Newswise | accessdate=2008-19-20}} </ref> The oldest definitive insect fossil is the [[Devonian]] ''[[Rhyniognatha|Rhyniognatha hirsti]]'', from the 396 million year old [[Rhynie chert]]. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles, a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the [[Silurian]] period.<ref name="EngelGrim">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6975/full/nature02291.html|last=Engel|first=Michael S. |coauthors=David A.

The origins of [[insect flight]] remain obscure, since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. So far, there is no evidence that suggests that the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they got their wings.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[David Grimaldi|Grimaldi, D.]] and [[Michael S. Engel|Engel, M.S.]] |title=Evolution of the Insects|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-82149-5}}</ref>

[[Pennsylvanian|Late Carboniferous]] and [[Cisuralian|Early Permian]] insect orders include both several current very long-lived groups and a number of Paleozoic forms. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70&nbsp;cm, (22–28&nbsp;in) making them far larger than any living insect. This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the [[Permian]] era that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years ago.<ref name="History of Insects"/>

The remarkably successful Hymenopterans appeared in the [[Cretaceous]] but achieved their diversity more recently, in the [[Cenozoic]]. A number of highly-successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with [[flowering plants]], a powerful illustration of [[co-evolution]].<ref name="Biology-coevolution"/>

Many modern insect genera developed during the [[Cenozoic]]; insects from this period on are often found preserved in [[amber]], often in perfect condition. Such specimens are easily compared with modern species. The study of fossilized insects is called [[Entomology|paleoentomology]].

=== Coevolution ===
:{{seealso|Coevolution}}
Insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants.<ref name="Biology-coevolution">{{cite web | author=J. Stein Carter |title=Coevolution and Pollination | url=http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio303/coevolution.htm | work= | publisher=University of Cincinnati | date=2005-03-29 | accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> Plants evolved chemical [[Plant defense against herbivory|defenses against this herbivory]] and the insects in turn evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been utilized by [[mimic]]s. Over time, this has led to complex groups of [[coevolution|co-evolved]] species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects are beneficial (''see'' [[pollination]]), and coevolution has led to the development of very specific [[mutualism]]s in such systems.

Traditional morphology-based systematics has included in[[Hexapoda]], usually given the rank of [[superclass (biology)|superclass]],<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|180}} four groups - Insects ([[Ectognatha]]), springtails ([[Collembola]]), [[Protura]] and [[Diplura]], the latter three being grouped together as [[Entognatha]] on the basis of internalized mouthparts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of [[cladistic]] methods and genetic data. A recent hypothesis is that Hexapoda is polyphyletic, with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from Insecta.<ref>{{cite web | title=Classification of Insect | author=David A.

As many of the traditional morphology-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, it is best to avoid using terms such as [[subclass]], [[superorder]] and [[infraorder]] and instead focus on monophyletic groupings.

Insects can be divided into two groups, historically treated as subclasses: Apterygota (wingless) and Pterygota (winged). The Apterygota consists of two primitively wingless orders – Archaeognatha (bristletails) and Thysanura (silverfish). Archaeognatha makes up the Monocondylia (based on mandibular morphology) while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. It is  possible that the Thysanura itself is not [[monophyletic]], with the family [[Lepidotrichidae]] a [[sister group]] to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura). 

Paleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects, separated by the presence of sclerites and musculature that allow for folding of the wings flat over the abdomen in the latter group. Neoptera can further be divided into hemimetabolous ([[Polyneoptera]] & [[Paraneoptera]]) and Holometabolous groups. It has proven particularly difficult to elucidate interordinal relationships within Polyneoptera. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form Eukinolabia.<ref>Terry, M. D. and M. F. Whiting. 2005. Mantophasmatodea and phylogeny of the lower neopterous insects. Cladistics 21(3): 240–257</ref> Mantodea, Blattodea & Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed [[Dictyoptera]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink=Lo, N., G. Tokuda, H.

P., Yoshizawa, K. and V. S. Smith. 2004. Multiple origins of parasitism in lice. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London 271: 1771–1776.</ref>

It is quite likely that Exopterygota is [[paraphyletic]] in regards to Endopterygota.  Contentious matters include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as Halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community.<ref>Bonneton, F., F. G. Brunet, J. Kathirithamby, V. Laudet. 2006. The rapid divergence of the ecdysone receptor is a synapomorphy for Mecopterida that clarifies the Strepsiptera problem.

Zoologica Scripta 31(1): 93–104.</ref> Many questions remain to be answered when it comes to basal relationships amongst endopterygote orders, particularly Hymenoptera.

The study of the classification or taxonomy of any insect is called [[Entomology|systemic entomology]]. Normally, if one chooses to work with a more specific order or even a family, the sytemics would be added to the study of that order or family, an example would be [[Dipterology|systemic dipterology]]

Many insects are considered pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic ([[mosquito]]es, [[lice]], [[bed bug]]s), transmit diseases ([[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]]), damage structures ([[termite]]s), or destroy agricultural goods ([[locust]]s, [[weevil]]s). Many [[entomologist]]s are involved in various forms of [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, often using [[insecticides]], but more and more relying on methods of [[Biological pest control|biocontrol]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Beneficial Insects, Mites and Organisms | url=http://www.biconet.com/biocontrol.html | publisher=Biocontrol Network | accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Davidson, E. |year=2006|title= ''Big Fleas Have Little Fleas: How Discoveries of Invertebrate Diseases Are Advancing Modern Science'' |pages= |ISBN= 0-8165-2544-7}}</ref>

Although pest insects attract the most attention, many insects are beneficial to the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and to [[human]]s. Some [[pollination|pollinate]] [[flowering plant]]s (for example [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], and [[ant]]s). Pollination is a trade between plants that need to reproduce, and pollinators that receive rewards of [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] and [[pollen]]. A serious environmental problem today is the [[pollinator decline|decline of populations of pollinator]] insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for [[pollination management]] in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, [[orchard]] or [[greenhouse]] at [[bloom]] time.

Insects also produce useful substances such as [[honey]], [[wax]], [[lacquer]] and [[silk]]. [[Honey bee]]s have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for [[beekeeper]]s. The [[silkworm]] has greatly affected human history, as [[Silk Road|silk-driven trade]] established relationships between China and the rest of the world. In some cultures, insects, especially [[deep-fried]] [[cicada]]s, are considered to be [[Delicatessen|delicacies]], and, in fact, have a high protein content for their mass. In most first-world countries, however, the consumption of insects is eschewed, although peoples in these cultures tend to accidentally consume between 50 and 90 insects in a given year, though this number varies based on region. [[Fly]] larvae ([[maggot]]s) were formerly used to [[Maggot therapy|treat wounds]] to prevent or stop [[gangrene]], as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Adult insects such as crickets, and insect larvae of various kinds are also commonly used as fishing bait.

In some parts of the world, [[Entomophagy|insects are used for human food]], while being a [[taboo]] in other places. There are proponents of developing this use to provide a major source of [[protein]] in human [[nutrition]].<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|10–13}} Since it is impossible to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain, insects already are present in many foods, especially grains. Most people do not realize that [[food safety]] laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit the quantity. According to [[cultural materialism|cultural materialist]] anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have protein sources that require less work, like farm birds or cattle.

Many insects, especially [[beetle]]s, are [[scavenger]]s, feeding on dead animals and fallen trees, [[recycling]] the biological materials into forms found useful by other [[organism]]s, and insects are responsible for much of the process by which [[topsoil]] is created.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|3, 218–228}} The [[ancient Egyptian religion]] adored [[dung beetle]]s and represented them as beetle-shaped [[amulet]]s, or scarabs. Dung beetles have been used in countries including [[Australia]] as an agent of [[biological control]] to reduce the populations of pestilent flies and parasitic worms. The [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] (1965–1985), led by Dr. [[George Bornemissza]] of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) successfully introduced 23 species of dung beetle, including ''Onthophagus gazella'' and ''Euoniticellus intermedius'' from [[South Africa]] and [[Europe]] and found a reduction in bush flies of 90% as well as improved soil fertility and quality<ref name="adbp">Bornemissza, G. F. (1976), The Australian dung beetle project 1965-1975, ''Australian Meat Research Committee Review'' 30:1–30</ref><!---Missylisa153, August 2009--->. 

The most useful of all insects are [[insectivore]]s, those that feed on other insects. Many insects can potentially reproduce so quickly that if all of their offspring were to survive, they could literally bury the earth in a single season. However, for any given insect, there will be plenty of species of insects that are either [[parasitoid]]s or [[predator]]s that play a significant role in controlling it.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|328–348}} This role in ecology is usually assumed to be primarily one of [[bird]]s, but insects, though less glamorous, are much more significant.

Human attempts to control pests by insecticides can backfire, because important but unrecognised insects already helping to control pest populations are also killed by the poison, leading eventually to population explosions of the pest species.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston" />{{rp|400}}<ref>{{cite web | title=Biocontrol Network - Beneficial Insects | url=http://www.biconet.com/biocontrol.html | work= | publisher=Biocontrol Network | date= | accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Davidson, RH and William F.
