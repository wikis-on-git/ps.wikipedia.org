'''د هنګري جمهوريت''' (''Magyar Köztársaság'' {{audio|hu-Magyar Köztársaság.ogg|listen}}), or '''هنګري''' (''Magyarország'' {{audio|hu-Magyarország.ogg|listen}}), is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe]], bordered by [[اطريش]], [[سلواکيا]], [[اوکراين]], [[رومانيا]], [[سربيا]], [[کروآسيا]] and [[سلووېنيا]]. It is known locally as the ''Country of the [[Magyars]]''.

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[د هنګري تاريخ]]''

In the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Roman citizenship|Romans]] called the region [[Pannonia]] (west from the [[Danube river]]). After Rome fell under the [[Germanic tribes]] migration and [[Carpia|Carpians']] pressure, the [[Migration Period]] continued bringing many invaders. First came the [[Huns]], who built up a powerful empire under [[Attila the Hun|Attila]]. The name "Hungary" comes from the name of a later, 7th century [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] alliance called [[On-Ogour]], which in Old Turkish meant "(the) Ten Arrows" [Note : see below]. 
After the Hunnish rule faded, the other Germanic tribes [[Lombards]] and [[Gepids]] ruled in Pannonia for about 100 years, during which the [[Slavic tribes]] also began migrating south. In the [[560s]], these were supplanted by the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] who would maintain their supremacy of the land for over two centuries. The [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]] from the west and the [[Bulgars]] from the southeast finally managed to overthrow the Avars in the early 9th century. Soon after, the Franks retreated, and the Slavonic kingdom of [[Great Moravia]] and the [[Balaton Principality]] controlled much of Pannonia until the end of the century. Finally, the [[Magyars]] migrated to Hungary in the late 9th century.
[[Image:Arpadfeszty.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Arpad]]Tradition holds that the Country of the Magyars (Magyarország) was founded by [[Árpád]], who led the [[Magyars]] into the [[Pannonian plain]]s after [[895]]. The "Ten Arrows" mentioned above referred to ten tribes, the alliance of which founded the basic Magyar invaders' "army". 

The Kingdom of Hungary was established in 1000 by King St.Stephen I (Hungarian : ''István'').  King Stephen I was the pagan leader of the nation (under the name "Vajk") and was traditionally considered a direct descendant of Árpád.  After King Stephen I (then Prince Vajk) married Gisella, the daughter of Prince Henry of Bavaria, in AD 996, he  converted to Christianity.  St. Stephen I received his crown from Pope Silvester II around Christmas in AD 1000. As a Christian king, he established the Hungarian Church with ten dioceses and the royal administration of the country that was divided into counties ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]] or ''vármegye''). Hungary became a patrimonial kingdom where the majority of the lands were the private property of the ruler.

Initially, Hungarian history and politics developed in close association with that of [[Poland]] and [[Bohemia]], driven by the interventions of various Popes and Emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Between [[1241]]&ndash;[[1242]], Hungary was devastated, suffering great loss of life at the hands of [[Mongol]] ([[Tatar]]) armies of [[Batu Khan]] who defeated the Hungarians at the [[battle of Muhi]].

Gradually Hungary, under the rule of the dynasty of the [[Árpáds]], turned into an independent kingdom which formed a distinct Central European culture with ties to greater West European [[civilization]]. Ruled by the [[Angevins]] since [[1308]], the Kingdom of Hungary briefly extended its control over [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. The non-dynastic king [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]], son of [[János Hunyadi]] ([[John Hunyadi]]), ruled the Kingdom of Hungary from 1458 to 1490. He strengthened Hungary and its government. Under his rule, Hungary (notably the northern parts,most of which are today parts of [[Slovakia]]) became an important artistic and cultural centre of Europe during the [[Renaissance]]. Hungarian culture influenced others, for example the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].  King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]] was also successful in many battles against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]].  However, since he had no successors, his empire fell apart after his death.

Hungarian independence ended with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest at the beginning of the [[16th century]]; the parts of Hungary that were not conquered by the Ottomans were annexed by [[Austria]] (the rulers of which were Hungarian kings at the same time) in the West, and became the independent Principality of [[Transylvania]] in the East. After 150 years, [[Austria]] and its Christian allies also regained the territory of today's Hungary by the end of the [[17th century]] from the Islamic Ottoman Empire.

After the final retreat of the [[Turkey|Turks]], struggle began between the Hungarian nation and the [[Habsburg]] kings for the protection of noblemen's rights (thus guarding the autonomy of Hungary). The fight against Austrian absolutism resulted in the unsuccessful popular freedom fight led by a Transylvanian nobleman, [[Ferenc II Rákóczi]], between 1703 and 1711. The revolution and war of 1848&ndash;1849 eliminated [[serfdom]] and secured civil rights. The Austrians were finally able to prevail only with Russian help.

Thanks to the victories against Austria by the French-Italian coalition (the [[Battle of Solferino]], [[1859]]) and Prussia ([[Battle of Königgratz]], [[1866]]), Hungary would eventually, in [[1867]], manage to become an autonomous part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (see [[Ausgleich]]). Having achieved this, the Hungarian government took an effort to nationally unify the kingdom by [[Magyarisation]] of the various other nationalities. This lasted until the end of [[World War I]], when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed. On [[November 16]], [[1918]], an independent Hungarian Republic was proclaimed.

In March [[1919]] the communists took power, and in April, [[Béla Kun]] proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. This government, like its predecessor, proved to be short-lived; after some initial military successes against the Czechoslovak army, the [[Romania]]ns attacked to prevent a campaign in [[Transylvania]]. By August more than half of present-day Hungary, including Budapest, was placed under Romanian occupation, which lasted until November. Rightist military forces, led by the former Austro-Hungarian Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], entered Budapest in the wake of the Romanian army's departure and filled the vacuum of state power. In January [[1920]], elections were held for a unicameral assembly, and Admiral Horthy was subsequently elected Regent, thereby formally restoring Hungary to a kingdom, although there were no more Kings of Hungary, despite attempts by the former Habsburg king to return to power. Horthy continued to rule with autocratic powers until [[1944]].

In June 4th, 1920 the [[Treaty of Trianon]] was signed, fixing Hungary's borders. Compared with the pre-war Kingdom, Hungary lost 71% of its territory,66% of its population, and with the new borders about one-third of the Magyar population became minorities in the neighbouring countries. Therefore, Hungarian politics and culture of the interwar period were saturated with [[irredentism]] (the restoration of 19th century "[[greater Hungary]]").

Horthy made an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[1930s]], in the hope of revising the territorial losses that had followed World War I. The alliance did lead to some territories being returned to Hungary in the two [[Vienna Awards]]. Hungary then assisted the German occupation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], occupying the [[Banat]] right afterwards, and finally entered [[World War II]] in 1941, fighting primarily against the Soviet Union. In October 1944, [[Hitler]] replaced Horthy with the Hungarian Nazi collaborator [[Ferenc Szálasi]] and his [[Arrow Cross Party]] in order to avert Hungary's defection to the Allied side, which was constantly threatened since the Allied invasion of Italy. 
[[Image:Timea Vagvoelgyi poster2.jpg|200px]]
Hungary passed a series of [[History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary#20th_Century:_Persecution_and_destruction|anti-Semitic laws]] throughout the 1920s and thirties, and some massacres of Jews by Hungarian forces took place in the early part of the Second World War, but Hungary initially resisted large scale deportation of its Jewish population. Ultimately, however, during the German occupation, the [[Arrow Cross Party]] and government authorities participated in the [[Holocaust]]: in May and June of 1944, Hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 Jews in more than 145 trains, mostly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/index.php?ModuleId=10005458]. Ultimately, over 400,000 Jews in Hungary were killed during the [[Holocaust]], as well as several tens of thousands of [[Roma people|Roma]].  [[Raoul Wallenberg]], a Swedish diplomat saved many Jews in Hungary.  

Following the fall of Nazi Germany, Hungary became part of the Soviet area of influence and was appropriated into a [[communist state]] following a short period of democracy in 1946&ndash;1947. After 1948, Communist leader Mátyás Rákosi established a Stalinist rule in the country, which was hardly bearable for the war-torn country. This led to the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and an announced withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]] which were met with a massive military intervention by the [[Soviet Union]].  Nearly a quarter of a million people left the country left during the brief time that the borders were open in 1956.  From the 1960s on to the late 1980s Hungary was sometimes satirically called "[[the happiest barrack]]" within the [[Eastern bloc]], under the rule of late controversial communist leader [[János Kádár]], who exercised autocratic rule during this period. In the late [[1980s]], Hungary led the movement to dissolve the Warsaw Pact and shifted toward multiparty democracy and a market-oriented economy. On October 23rd, [[1989]] Szűrös Mátyás declared the Third Hungarian Republic and became interim President of the Republic. The first free elections were held in 1990. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in [[1991]], Hungary developed closer ties with Western Europe, joined [[NATO]] in [[1999]] and the [[European Union]] on [[May 1]], [[2004]].

== جغرافيه ==
[[Image:Hu-map.png|thumb|Map of Hungary]]
''Main article: [[د هنګري جغرافيه]]''

Hungary's landscape consists mostly of the flat to rolling plains of the [[Carpathian Basin]], with hills and lower mountains to the north along the [[Slovakia]]n border (highest point: the [[Kékes]] at 3,327&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]; 1,014 m). Hungary is divided in two by its main waterway, the [[Danube]] (''Duna''); other large rivers include the [[Tisza]] and [[Dráva]], while the western half contains [[Lake Balaton]], a major body of water. The largest thermal lake in the world, [[Lake Hévíz]] ([[Hévíz Spa]]), is located in Hungary. The second largest lake in the [[Carpathian Basin]] (and probably the largest artificial lake in Europe) is [[Lake Theiss]] (''Tisza-tó'').

=== Climate ===
Hungary has a [[continental climate]], with cold, cloudy, humid winters and warm to hot summers. Average annual temperature is 9.7 °[[Celsius|C]] (49.5 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]). Temperature extremes are about 38 °C (100 °F) in the summer and &minus;29 °C (&minus;20 °F) in the winter. Average temperature in the summer is 27 to 32 °C (81 to 90 °F), and in the winter it is 0 to &minus;15 °C (32 to 5 °F). The average yearly rainfall is approximately 600 millimetres (24&nbsp;[[inch|in]]). A small, southern region of the country near [[Pécs]] enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]].

The relative isolation of the Carpathian Basin makes it susceptible to [[drought]]s and the effects of [[global warming]] are already felt. According to popular opinion, and many scientists, in the latest decades the country became drier, as droughts are quite common; and summers became hotter, winters became milder. Because of these reasons snow has become much more rare in the area than before. Popular opinion also states that the four-season system became a two-season system as [[spring (season)|spring]] and [[autumn]] are getting shorter and shorter, even vanishing some years. 

Most of Hungary is covered by agricultural plains, there are but few remnants of its original forests.

== Demographics ==
====Historical====
* [[Circa]] [[900]] [[Anno Domini|AD]]- according to various sources 250,000 - 500,000 [[Magyars]] settled in the Pannonian plain, inhabited predominantly by Slavs
* [[1222]] - 2,000,000 at the time of [[Golden Bull]]
* [[1242]] - 1,200,000 after the Mongol-Tatars invasion
* [[1370]] - 2,500,000 at the time of [[Angevin]] kings
* [[1490]] - 4,000,000 before the Ottoman conquest (3.2 million Magyars)
* [[1699]] - 3,300,000 at the time of [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (less than 2 million Magyars)
* [[1711]] - 3,000,000 at the end of [[Kuruc]] War (1.6 million Magyars)
* [[1790]] - 8,000,000 (39% Magyars)
* [[1828]] - 11,495,536
* [[1846]] - 12,033,399
* [[1880]] - 13,749,603 (46% Magyars)
* [[1900]] - 16,838,255 (51,4% Magyars)
* [[1910]] - 18,264,533 (54,5% Magyars, 5% [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews]])
* [[1920]] - 7.516.000 after the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (90% Magyars, 6.1% Jews)

====Present====
''Main article: [[Demographics of Hungary]]''

For some 95% of the population, mostly [[Hungarians]], the mother tongue is [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], a [[Finno-Ugric]] language unrelated to any neighbouring language. Several ethnic minorities exist: [[Roma (people)|Roma]] (2%), [[ethnic German|German]]s (1.2%), [[Romanians]] (0.8%), [[Slovaks]] (0.4%), [[Croats]] (0.2%), [[Serbs]] (0.2%) and [[Ukrainians]] (0.1%). 

The largest religion in Hungary is [[Catholicism]] &ndash; [[Latin Rite|Roman]] and [[Eastern Rite|Greek]] &ndash; (around half of the population), with a [[Calvinist]] minority (around 16%) and some [[Lutheran]]s (3%).[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/hu.html] Jews are now approximately 1% of the population. However, these formal figures are not wholly representative, since the Hungarian population is not particularly religious; no more than 25% actively practice their faith. Furthermore, the active suppression of religion by the Communist regimes over 50 years has left religion mostly to older people who no longer were risking advancement opportunities.

Due to historical reasons, significant [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority populations can be found in the surrounding countries, notably in [[Ukraine]] (in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]), [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]] (in [[Transylvania]]), and [[Serbia]] (in [[Vojvodina]]). [[Austria]] (in [[Burgenland]]), [[Croatia]], and [[Slovenia]] are also host to a number of ethnic Magyars.

====The Roma Minority====
The real number of the [[Roma people]] in Hungary is a very much disputed question. In the 2001 census only 190'000 people called themselves Roma but sociological estimates give much higher numbers (about 5-10 percent of the total population). Since the 2nd world war Roma people are increasing rapidly and their number septupled in the last century. Romas suffer particular problems in Hungary. Currently slightly more than 80 % of Roma children complete primary education, but only one third continue studies into the intermediate (secondary) level. This is far lower than the more than 90 % proportion of children of non-Roma families who continue studies at an intermediate level. The situation is made still worse by the fact that a large proportion of young Roma are qualified in subjects that provide them only limited chances for employment. Less than 1 % of Roma hold higher educational certificates. Their low status on the job market and higher unemployment rates cause poverty, widespread social problems and crime.

[[Image:Parlament Budapest3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The building of Hungarian Parliament]]
The [[President of Hungary|President of the Republic]], elected by the [[parliament]] every 5 years, has a largely ceremonial role, but powers also include appointing the [[Prime Minister of Hungary|prime minister]] and choosing the dates of the parlamentary elections. The prime minister selects [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] ministers and has the exclusive right to dismiss them. Each cabinet nominee appears before one or more parliamentary committees in consultative open hearings and must be formally approved by the president.

The [[unicameral]], 386-member [[National Assembly of Hungary|National Assembly]] (the ''Országgyűlés'') is the highest organ of state authority and initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. National parliamentary elections are held every 4 years (the next will be held on April 9th 2006). An 11-member Constitutional Court has power to challenge legislation on grounds of unconstitutionality.

=== Administrative divisions ===
''Main article: [[Counties of Hungary]]''

Hungary is subdivided administratively into 19 counties, but since the admission to the European Union, Hungary has been subdivided into 7 euro-regions. In addition to these, there is one [[Capitals of Hungary|capital city]] (''főváros''): [[Budapest]]. There are also 23 so-called urban counties (singular ''megyei jogú város''), These are:

[[Image:Ungheria 100 forint.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Hungarian 100 Forint]]
Hungary continues to demonstrate strong economic growth as one of the newest members of the [[European Union]] (since 2004). Together with Slovenia and the Czech Republic, Hungary provides one of the highest standard of living among Eastern European countries. The private sector accounts for over 80% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Hungary gets nearly one third of all foreign direct investment flowing in to Central Europe. Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment totalling more than US$23 billion since [[1989]]. Hungarian sovereign debt was upgraded in [[2000]] to the second-highest rating among all the Central European transition economies. [[Inflation]] and [[unemployment]] &ndash; both priority concerns in [[2001]] &ndash; have declined substantially. Economic reform measures such as health care reform, tax reform, and local government financing have not yet been addressed by the present government.

The Hungarian government has expressed a desire to adopt the [[euro]] currency in 2010, but the introduction of the currency is currently only in the early planning stages.

== کلتور/فرهڼ ==
''Main article: [[د هنګري کلتور/فرهڼ]]''

[[Hungarian culture]] is diverse and varied.

[[Image:Franz Liszt photo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Franz Liszt]], prominent Hungarian composer]]
The [[music of Hungary]] consists mainly of traditional Hungarian [[folk music]] and music by prominent [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] composers such as [[Franz Liszt]], [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Zoltán Kodály]] (although the latter mainly composed music with traditional elements). Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] [[rhythm]], just as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.

[[Hungarian cuisine]] is also a prominent feature of Hungarian culture, with traditional dishes such as [[goulash]] a main feature of the Hungarian [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Dishes are often flavoured with [[paprika]] (also Hungarian for [[bell pepper|pepper]]). [[Stew]]s are often to be found with typical elements such as [[pork]] or [[beef]], as the stew ''pörkölt'' shows.

Hungary is famous for its mathematics institute which has trained many Nobel Prize winners. Famous Hungarian mathematicians include [[Paul Erdös]] who is famous for publishing in over forty languages and whose [[Erdös number]]s are still tracked, [[John von Neumann]] one of the pioneers in digital computing, [[Eugene Wigner]], and many others. Erdös, von Neumann, and Wigner, like other Hungarian Jewish scientists, fled rising anti-Semitism in Europe, and made their most famous contibutions in the United States.

Hungarians are very proud of their inventions. These include the noiseless [[match]], the [[Rubik cube]] and [[Non-Euclidean geometry]]. A number of other important inventions, including [[holography]], the [[ballpoint pen]] (invented by ''Bíró'', who gave his name to the invention), the theory of the [[hydrogen bomb]], and the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[programming language]], were invented by Hungarians who fled the country prior to World War II.

The literature of Hungary is extremely varied, and deserves an outstanding rank among the world's various literatures; however, it has only recently gained some renown (mostly through translations into German, French and English); till very recently, the lack of competent translators was blatant.

[[János Arany]] was a famous 19th Century Hungarian poet who wrote a very great and varied amount of poetry, and is much loved in Hungary, among several other "true classics"; his collection of [[Ballads]] is remarkable. [[Zsigmond Móricz]], [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[Sándor Márai]] and [[Imre Kertész]] have recently gained acclaim: the latter, a contemporary Jewish writer who survived the Holocaust, has won the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature.

Hungarians are also known for their prowess at [[Water sport (recreation)|water sports]], mainly [[swimming]], [[water polo]] and canoeing; this can be said to be surprising at first, due to Hungary being [[landlocked]]. On the other hand, the presence of two major rivers ([[Danube|Duna]]/[[Tisza]]) and a major lake ([[Balaton]]) gives excellent opportunities to practice those sports.
