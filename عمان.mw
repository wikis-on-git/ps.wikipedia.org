The '''Sultanate of Oman''' ([[Standard Arabic]]:'''سلطنة عُمان''' ''Saltanat ˤUmān'') is a country in the [[Southwest Asia|southwestern part]] of [[Asia]], on the southeast coast of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It borders the [[متحده عرب امارات]] in the northwest, [[سعودي عربستان]] in the west, and [[يمن]] in the southwest. The coast is formed by the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south and east, and the [[Gulf of Oman]] in the northeast. The country also has an [[exclave]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Oman}}

The Sultanate of Oman was once known by its [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] name [[Magan]]. Oman constituted one of the [[Satrap]]ies of the [[Persian Empire]]. It was incorporated into that empire around [[563 BC]]. This earlier empire was succeeded by the [[Sassanian Empire]] in the 3rd century AD.

By the beginning of the first century of the Common Era, Arab tribes began to settle in Oman. In 632, the Sassanids lost power and Arab dominance in Oman was established.

In [[751]], [[Ibadi|Ibādī]] [[Muslim]]s established an [[imamate|imāmate]] in Oman. [[Imam|Imāms]] exercised spiritual leadership over the country. The Ibādiyya are a branch of the [[Kharijite]]s, the earliest Muslim sect which rejected both potential successors to [[Muhammad|Muħammad]]'s leadership. This imāmate survived until the mid-20th Century.

Oman has been a centre for traders for centuries. In [[1508]], the main port, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], was captured by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who held it until it was taken by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in [[1659]]. The Ottomans were driven out in [[1741]], when the present line of [[sultan]]s was formed by Aħmad ibn Saˤīd. However, Oman was occupied by Persia between [[1743]] and [[1746]].

In the early [[19th century]], Oman grew to a major power, having possessions in [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Zanzibar]], but these were gradually all lost. The final one, [[Gwadar]], was sold to [[Pakistan]] in [[1958]].  In [[1891]], Oman became a [[United Kingdom|British]] protectorate, which lasted until [[1971]].

The year prior, Sultān [[Said Bin Taimur of Muscat|Saˤīd ibn Taymūr]] was ousted by his son, Sultān [[Qaboos of Oman|Qabūs ibn Saˤīd as-Saˤīd]] (r. 1970-). Sultān Qabūs has since greatly improved the economic situation of the country, remaining in peace with all other countries in the [[Middle East]]. In 1996, the sultan issued a decree promulgating a new basic law that clarifies the royal succession, provides for a bicameral advisory council with some limited legislative powers and a prime minister and guarantees basic civil liberties for Omani citizens.

Military bases in Oman were used (2001) by US forces involved in ground raids against Taliban forces in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]. In 2003, the lower house of the advisory council was freely elected for the first time.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Oman}}
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Qaboospalace.jpg|thumb|Alam Palace, Muscat]] -->
Chief of state and government is the hereditary sultān, [[Qaboos of Oman|Qabūs ibn Saˤīd as-Saˤīd]], who appoints a cabinet to assist him. In the early [[1990s]], the sultān instituted an elected advisory council, the ''Majlis ash-Shura'', though few Omanis were eligible to vote.

[[Universal suffrage]] for those over 21 was instituted on [[4 October]] [[2003]]. Over 190,000 people (74% of those registered) voted to elect the 83 seats. Two women were elected to seats.

The sultān functions essentially as an [[political absolutism|absolute]] ruler. 

== Government ==
While His Majesty Sultan Qaboos functions as absolute ruler, Oman's government is organized into several categories of institutions.

Oman's governmental functions are chiefly implemented by [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]].  There are ministries of:

===== National Economy =====
=====Oil and Gas=====
===== Commerce and Industry =====
=====Education=====
===== Information =====
=====Social Development=====
===== Heritage and Culture =====

===== Tourism =====
=====Civil Services=====
===== Regional Municipalities, Environment, and Water Resources =====
=====Agriculture and Fisheries=====
===== Manpower =====
=====Religious Affairs=====

Oman is a muslim country (75% ibadis Muslim)other is sunna and shia

===== Housing, Electricity, and Water =====
=====Communications (previously Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones)=====

Representing His Majesty Sultan Qaboos directly is the Diwan of the Royal Court and Palace Affairs.  In practice, the Diwan operates outside the mandate of other parts of the Omani government with superceding authority.

Ministries are headed by a [[Minister]], a position carrying the title [[excellency|His Excellency]]. Ministries can have several under secretaries, also carrying title Your Excellency. Similarly, the Diwan has a minister and under secretaries. Ministers and under secretaries are appointed by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos; they are not elected. No qualifications of education or experience are required to hold office.

[[Bureaucracy]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]] are growing problem in the Omani government, in part because of a lack of fixed terms or qualifications for senior posts, and partly because all government funding is controlled by the Ministry of Finance, creating a severe operational [[bottleneck]]. This is a particularly daunting problem because more than 50% of the Omani economy is channeled through government institutions and contracts.

Unlike in Oman's neighboring [[United Arab Emirates]] which has a hard and fast policy of prompt payment and adhering to contractual obligations with private sector contracts, no protections or guarantees exist to hold government institutions liable for fair conduct. Consequently, horror stories abound of work contracts violated or ignored by government institutions, and several international business bureaus advise against doing business with the Omani government due to these problems.

== Subdivisions ==
[[دوتنه:Oman subdivisions.png|right|240px]]
{{main|Subdivisions of Oman}}

Oman is divided into three [[governorate]]s (''[[muhafazah]]'') and five regions (''[[mintaqah|mintaqat]]''). These regions are subdivided into provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayat]]'').

* [[Ad Dakhiliyah Region|Ad Dakhiliyah]]
* [[Al Batinah Region|Al Batinah]]
* [[Al Wusta Region (Oman)|Al Wusta]]
* [[Ash Sharqiyah Region (Oman)|Ash Sharqiyah]]
* [[Az Zahirah]] or [[Ad Dhahirah]]

Governorates
* [[Masqat]] or [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]
* [[Musandam]]
* [[Dhofar]]

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Wadi Shab (13).jpg|thumb|280px|left|Wadi Shab]]
{{main|Geography of Oman}}

A vast desert plain covers most of central Oman, with mountain ranges along the north ([[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]]) and southeast coast, where the country's main cities are also located: capital city [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Matrah]] and [[Sur, Oman|Sur]] in the north, and [[Salalah]] in the south. Oman's climate is hot and dry in the interior and humid along the coast. During past millennia Oman was covered by ocean. Fossilized shells exist in great numbers in areas of the desert up to 50 miles from the modern coastline.

Oman is considered to be one of the fifteen states that make up the so-called "[[Cradle of Humanity]]". Not all of Oman's borders with the [[United Arab Emirates]] are well-defined.

=== Exclaves and enclaves ===
The peninsula of [[Musandam]] (Musandem), which has a strategic location on the [[Strait of Hormuz]], is separated from the rest of Oman by the [[United Arab Emirates]] and is thus an [[exclave]].

Oman has one other exclave, this time inside UAE territory, known as [[Wadi-e-Madhah]]. It is located halfway between the Musandam Peninsula and the rest of Oman [http://geosite.jankrogh.com/oman.htm]. The exclave is on the [[Dubai]]-[[Hatta]] road in the Emirate of [[Sharjah]]. Belonging to [[Musandam]] governorate, it covers approximately 75 [[square kilometre]]s <!-- Format per WP:MOSNUM -->(29&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). The boundary was settled in [[1969]]. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the [[Khorfakkan]]-[[Fujairah]] road, barely 10 metres (30&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) away. Within the exclave is an UAE enclave called [[Nahwa]], belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about 8 kilometres (5&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about 40 houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange [http://geosite.jankrogh.com/nahwa.htm].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Oman}}

The economy of Oman is dominated by its dependence on [[crude oil]]. A joint venture called IPC drilled a number of dry holes from [[1956]] onwards though the logistics of doing this were extremely difficult due to lack of any transportation infrastructure.

A lack of success, combined with worsening logistical problems and a glut of oil on the world market, led most of the partners to withdraw from the venture in [[1960]]. Only [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch/Shell]] and [[Partex]] opted to remain in Oman to continue the search for oil. They struck oil at [[Fahud]] in [[1962]] at a site just some few hundreds of metres from the last dry hole.

In June 1967, the [[Compagnie Française des Pétroles]] rejoined the partnership by taking over 10% of Partex's equity share, resulting in the following shareholding: Shell 85%, Compagnie Française des Pétroles 10% and Partex 5%. The company changed its name to Petroleum Development (Oman). Shortly followed by the first export of Omani oil on [[27 July]] [[1967]].

On [[1 January]] [[1974]] the Government of Oman acquired a 25% shareholding in the Petroleum Development (Oman); half a year later they increased it to 60%, backdated to the beginning of the year. As a result foreign shareholding in PD(O) was now made up of Royal Dutch/Shell (34%), Compagnie Française des Pétroles (now [[Total S.A.|Total]]) (4%) and Partex (2%).

In a Royal Decree of [[15 May]] [[1980]], the company was registered as a [[limited liability company]] (LLC) under the name [[Petroleum Development Oman]].

Today Oman produces around 700,000 [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] (110,000 m³) of oil per day and there have been significant discoveries of [[natural gas]] and development of a [[liquefied natural gas]] terminal. Oil represents about 90% of Oman's exports.

The income generated was quickly deployed into building infrastructures of roads, schools, hospitals, water and electricity generating plants. All of this activity has made Oman a major success story for economic growth despite being the only oil-producing nation in the [[middle east]] that is not a member of [[OPEC]].

Oman's economic performance improved significantly in [[2000]] due largely to the upturn in oil prices. The government is moving ahead with privatization of its utilities, the development of a body of commercial law to facilitate foreign investment, and increased budgetary outlays. Oman continues to liberalise its markets and joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in [[November 2000]]. [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth improved in [[2001]] despite the global economic slowdown.

On [[20 July]] [[2006]], the U.S. [[House of Representatives]] narrowly approved a [[US-Oman Free Trade Agreement]] by a vote of 221-205. [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll392.xml] The Congressional debate around the pact was affected by partisan, midterm election politics that repeated several free-trade versus protectionist arguments regarding labor rights and national security.  Regarding labor rights, the Government of Oman made numerous commitments to revise its labor laws to satisfy Congressional concerns.  With respect to the assertions that the Agreement threatend the ability of the United States Government to protect its essential national security, the Congressional Research Service prepared several papers explaining that such was not the case. A recent State Department report criticized Oman for not taking enough action to reduce human trafficking but also acknowledged that the country "is making significant efforts to do so."  The treaty will immediately end all duties on trade in industrial and consumer goods and give American farmers duty-free access to Oman's market for 87% of their products. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-5964717,00.html]

US President [[George W. Bush]] is expected to sign it, and implementation may come shortly. Proponents of the deal claim that the pact will help liberalise the Omani market and open it to U.S. goods.[http://www.ecattrade.com/issues/subsection.asp?id=47]

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Oman}}
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Qaboosemosque.jpg|thumb|Qaboos Mosque]] -->
Oman is the world's easternmost Arabian country. The majority of Omanis are [[Arab]]s, although there are sizable [[Baloch]] and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] minorities. As in most other Arab countries, a large number of foreign laborers live here, mostly from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. The official language is [[Arab language|Arabic]], but the minorities speak their own languages. A non-Arabic [[Semitic]] language [[Bathari]] is spoken in Dhofar.

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion, mostly [[Ibadi|Ibādiyya]], with a [[Sunni]] population in Dhofar. Exact numbers are not certain.

== Culture ==
Even though Oman is a modern country, western influences are quite restricted. The [[Ibadi|Ibādī]] form of Islam is fairly liberal in comparison with [[Sunni Islam]] and [[Shi'a Islam]]. In common with most Middle Eastern countries, alcohol is only available in some hotels and few restaurants.

Although Arabic is Oman's official language, there are native speakers of different dialects, as well as Baloochi, or offshoots of [[Southern Arabian]], a Semitic language only distantly related to Arabic. However, the dominant indigenous language is a dialect of Arabic. However, the country has adopted a second language which is widely spoken, English, and is on almost all signs and writings that you see.

Oman is famous for its [[khanjar]] knives.

== Human trafficking and Oman ==
The Bush administration State Department's 2006 Trafficking in Human Persons report downgraded Oman to a “Tier 2 Watch List” country. [http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2006/] Among the ways that the report found that human trafficking is a problem in Oman:

•	“Oman is a destination country for men and women primarily from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India who migrate willingly, but may subsequently become victims of trafficking when subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude as domestic workers and laborers.”(p. 196)

•	“There have been reports from foreign entities that expatriate children engaged in camel racing may transit or reside in Omani territory.” (p. 197)

•	“The Government of Oman does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking…Over the last year, Oman did not prosecute any trafficking cases and it failed to conduct anti-trafficking public awareness campaigns. The government lacks an adequate screening procedure to differentiate trafficking victims from the large number of foreigners it deports annually…”“…the Omani government did not report any prosecutions in the last 12 months and has taken no active measures to investigate trafficking in persons….”(p. 197)

•	“During the reporting period, the Omani government did not improve its minimal efforts to provide protection to expatriate workers who may fall victim to involuntary servitude. Foreigners illegally in Oman are housed in detention facilities and immigration officials have no screening procedure to distinguish illegal migrants from trafficking victims… Although the government pays for illegal migrants' repatriation, it has not established a system of protective services for victims of trafficking. Rather, it relies primarily on foreign embassies and charitable groups to tend to foreign nationals requiring assistance. The embassies of the Philippines and Sri Lanka, for instance, manage halfway houses for domestic workers. No formal referral mechanism exists to transfer potential trafficking victims to such organizations.” (p. 197)
