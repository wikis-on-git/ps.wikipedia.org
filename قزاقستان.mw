'''Kazakhstan''', also spelled '''Kazakstan''', ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: Қазақстан, ''Qazaqstan'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/qɑzɑqˈstɑn/}}; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Казахстан, ''Kazakhstán'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/kɐzəxˈstɐn/}}), officially the '''Republic of Kazakhstan''', is a country that stretches over a vast expanse of northern and central [[Eurasia]].  A [[Countries in both Europe and Asia|portion]] of its territory west of the [[Ural River]] is located in eastern-most [[Europe]]. It has borders with [[روسيه]], the [[چين]], and the [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] countries  [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[ازبکستان]] and [[Turkmenistan]], and has a coastline on the [[Caspian Sea]]. Kazakhstan was a republic of the former [[Soviet Union]] and is now a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Kazakhstan is the ninth-largest country in the world by area, but its semi-[[desert]]s ([[steppe]]) make it only the 57th country in population, with approximately 6 persons per sq km (15/mi²). Population in 2005 was estimated at 15,100,500 [http://www.stat.kz/en/info/stat-bul/stbr&e0303.pdf], down from 16,464,464 in 1989 [http://www.stat.kz/ru/dynamic/svedenia_rk/population/nas.htm].
== History ==
:''Main article: [[History of Kazakhstan]]''

Humans have inhabited what is now known as Kazakhstan since the earliest [[Stone Age]], generally pursuing the nomadic movement [[pastoralism]] for which the region's climate and terrain are best suited.  In fact, historians believe vast steppes of modern day Kazakhstan were where humans first domesticated the horse. From the [[4th century]] through the beginning of the [[7th century]], southern parts of the territory of what is now Kazakhstan were a part of and ruled by the [[Persian Empire]], and after the invasion of [[Persia]] by Arabs, ruled by a few nomadic kingdoms[http://www.bartleby.com/65/tu/Turkmeni.html]. Following the Mongolian invasion in the early 13th century, administrative districts were established under the [[Mongol Empire]], which eventually became the territories of the [[Kazakh Khanate]] (Ak Horde). The major medieval cities of [[Taraz|Aulie-Ata]] and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]] were founded along the northern route of the [[Silk Road|Great Silk Road]] during this period.

Traditional nomadic life on the vast [[steppe]] and semi-desert lands was characterized by a constant search for new pasture to support the livestock-based economy. The Kazakhs emerged from a mixture of tribes living in the region in about the [[15th century]] and by the middle of the [[16th century]] had developed a common language, culture, and economy. In the early 1600s, the Kazakh Khanate separated into the Great, Middle and Little (or Small) Hordes (jüz)&mdash;confederations based on extended family networks. Political disunion, competition among the hordes, and a lack of an internal market weakened the Kazakh Khanate. The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh Khanate.  The area was a bone of contention between the Kazak emirs and the [[Persian Kings]] for many centuries.

In the [[19th century]], the [[Russian Empire]] began to expand, and spread into [[Central Asia]]. The "[[Great Game]]" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]] of 1907. Following the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917 a second less intensive phase followed. The [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called "[[Great Game]]" between it and [[Great Britain]]. Russia enforced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organizations. Russian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment of the [[Kazakh people]], and by the 1860s, most Kazakhs resisted Russia's annexation largely because of the disruption it wrought upon the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 1800s, sought to preserve the Kazakh language and identity. From the 1890s onwards ever-larger numbers of Slavic settlers began [[colonising]] the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, in particular the province of [[Semirechye|Semirechie]]. The number of settlers rose still further once the [[Trans-Aral Railway]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]] was completed in 1906, and the movement was overseen and encouraged by a specially created Migration Department (Переселенческое Управление) in St. Petersburg. The competition for land and water which ensued between the Kazakhs and the incomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of tsarist Russia, with the most serious uprising, the [[Central Asian Revolt]], occurring in 1916.

Although there was a brief period of [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] during the tumultuous period following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Kazakhs eventually succumbed to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. In 1920, the area of present-day Kazakhstan became an [[Republics of Russia|autonomous republic]] within Russia and, in 1936, a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]].

Soviet repression of the traditional elites, along with forced [[collectivization]] in late 1920s-1930s, brought about mass hunger and led to unrest. Soviet rule, however, took hold, and a [[Communism|communist]] apparatus steadily worked to fully integrate Kazakhstan into the Soviet system. Kazakhstan experienced population inflows of thousands exiled from other parts of the Soviet Union during the 1930s and later became home for hundreds of thousands evacuated from the [[Second World War]] battlefields. The [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (SSR) contributed five national divisions to the Soviet Union's [[World War II]] effort.

The period of the Second World War marked an increase in [[industrialization]] and increased [[mineral extraction]] in support of the war effort. At the time of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, however, Kazakhstan still had an overwhelmingly agricultural-based economy. In [[1953]], Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated the ambitious "[[Virgin Lands]]" program to turn the traditional pasturelands of Kazakhstan into a major grain-producing region for the Soviet Union. The Virgin Lands policy, along with later modernizations under Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], sped up the development of the agricultural sector, which to this day remains the source of livelihood for a large percentage of Kazakhstan's population.

Growing tensions within Soviet society led to a demand for political and economic reforms, which came to a head in the 1980s. In [[December 1986]], mass demonstrations by young ethnic Kazakhs took place in [[Almaty]] to protest the methods of the [[communist system]]. Soviet troops suppressed the unrest, and dozens of demonstrators were jailed or killed. In the waning days of Soviet rule, discontent continued to grow and find expression under Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policy of [[glasnost]]. Caught up in the groundswell of Soviet republics seeking greater autonomy, Kazakhstan declared its [[sovereignty]] as a republic within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in [[October 1990]]. Following the [[August 1991]] abortive [[coup]] attempt in [[Moscow]] and the subsequent [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan declared independence on [[December 16]], [[1991]].

The years following [[independence]] have been marked by significant reforms to the Soviet command-economy and political [[monopoly]] on power. Under [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who initially came to power in 1989 as the head of the [[Kazakh Communist Party]] and was eventually elected President in 1991, Kazakhstan has made significant progress toward developing a [[market economy]] and a fledgling democracy. The country has enjoyed significant economic growth since 2000, partly due to its large oil, gas, and mineral reserves.

More recently, [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan's largest city and former capital, was a candidate to host the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The city did not make it to the finalist level, however.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Kazakhstan}}
[[Image:Nursultan Nazarbayev 1997.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Nursultan Nazarbayev]]
Kazakhstan is a [[constitution]]al [[republic]] with a strong presidency. The president is the [[head of state]]. The president also is the [[commander in chief]] of the armed forces and may [[veto]] legislation that has been passed by the [[Parliament]]. President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who has been in office since Kazakhstan became independent, won a new 7-year term in the 1999 election that the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] said fell short of international standards. The prime minister, who serves at the pleasure of the president, chairs the Cabinet of Ministers and serves as Kazakhstan's head of government. There are three deputy prime ministers and 16 ministers in the Cabinet. [[Daniyal Akhmetov|Daniyal K. Akhmetov]] became the Prime Minister in [[June 2003]].

Kazakhstan has a bicameral Parliament, comprised of the [[lower house]] (the [[Majilis]]) and [[upper house]] (the [[Senate]]). Single mandate districts popularly elect 67 seats in the Majilis; there also are 10 members elected by party-list vote rather than by single mandate districts. The Senate has 39 members. Two senators are selected by each of the elected assemblies ([[Maslikhats]]) of Kazakhstan's 16 principal administrative divisions (14 regions, or oblasts, plus the cities of Astana and Almaty). The president appoints the remaining seven senators. Majilis deputies and the government both have the right of legislative initiative, though the government proposes most legislation considered by the Parliament.

Elections to the Majilis in [[September 2004]] yielded a lower house dominated by the pro-government [[Otan party]], headed by President Nazarbayev. Two other parties considered sympathetic to the president, including the agrarian-industrial bloc [[AIST]] and the [[Asar party]], founded by President Nazarbayev’s daughter, won most of the remaining seats. Opposition parties, which were officially registered and competed in the elections, won a single seat during elections that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said fell short of international standards.

In 1999, Kazakhstan applied for observer status at the [[Council of Europe]] [[Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly|Parliamentary Assembly]]. The official response of the Assembly was that Kazakhstan could apply for full membership, because it is partially located in Europe, but that they would not be granted any status whatsoever at the Council until their [[democracy]] and [[human rights]] records improved.

On [[December 4]], [[2005]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] was reelected in a land-slide victory. The electoral commission announced that he had won over 90 % of the vote. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) concluded the election did not meet international standards despite some improvements in the administration of the election. [[Xinhua News Agency]] reported that [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] observers, responsible in overseeing 25 polling stations in [[Astana]], found that voting in those polls was conducted in a "transparent and fair" manner. [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=a2ml5vt5j2_M&refer=top_world_news]  Furthermore, Western governments were muted in their criticism of the election.


=== Kazakh Intelligence Services ===
Kazakhstan's National Security Committee (KNB) was established on [[13 June]] [[1992]]. It includes the Service of Internal Security, Military Counterintelligence, Border Guard, several Commandos units, and Foreign Intelligence (Barlau). The latter is considered by many as the most important part of KNB. Its director is [[Major General]] [[Omirtai Bitimov]].

==Administrative Divisions==
[[Image:Almaty-m.JPG|thumb|250px|Former capital of Kazakhstan - '''Almaty''']]''Main article: [[Provinces of Kazakhstan]]''

Kazakhstan is divided into 14 [[province]]s (''oblys'') and three municipal districts (''qala'')*: 

[[Taldy-Korgan]], [[Almaty]]*, [[Aqmola Province|Aqmola]] ([[Astana]]), [[Aqtöbe Province|Aqtöbe]], [[Astana]]*, [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]], [[Batys Qazaqstan]] ([[Oral]]), [[Bayqongyr]]*, [[Mangghystau]] ([[Aqtau]]; formerly Shevchenko), [[Ongtustik Qazaqstan]] ([[Shymkent]]), [[Pavlodar Province|Pavlodar]], [[Qaraghandy Province|Qaraghandy]], [[Qostanay]], [[Qyzylorda Province|Qyzylorda]], [[Shyghys Qazaqstan]] ([[Oskemen]]; formerly Ust'-Kamenogorsk), [[Soltustik Qazaqstan]] ([[Petropavl]]), [[Zhambyl Province|Zhambyl]] ([[Taraz]]; known as Dzhambul in the Soviet period, but before that as [[Aulie-Ata]])

''note:'' administrative divisions have the same names as their administrative centers (exceptions have the administrative center name following in parentheses); in 1995 the Governments of Kazakhstan and [[Russia]] entered into an agreement whereby Russia would lease for a period of 20 years an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi); enclosing the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Bayqongyr (Baykonur) space launch facilities]] and the city of Bayqongyr (formerly [[Leninsk]]).  Just recently, the lease of Bayqongyr facilities was extended through 2050.

Each is headed by an Akim (provincial governor) appointed by the president. Municipal Akims are appointed by oblast Akims. The Government of Kazakhstan transferred its capital from Almaty to Astana on [[December 10]], [[1997]].

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Kazakhstan]], [[List of cities in Kazakhstan]]''
[[Image:Kazakhstan-CIA WFB Map.png|300px|thumb|right|Map of Kazakhstan]]
With an area of 2.7 million [[square kilometer]]s<!--per [[WP:MOSNUM]]--> (1.05 million [[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), Kazakhstan is the ninth-largest nation in the world. It is equivalent to the size of [[Western Europe]]. It shares borders of 6,846 [[kilometer]]s<!--per [[WP:MOSNUM]]--> (4,254&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) with [[Russia]], 2,203 kilometers (1,369&nbsp;mi) with [[Uzbekistan]], 1,533 kilometers (953&nbsp;mi) with [[China]], 1,051 kilometers (653&nbsp;mi) with [[Kyrgyzstan]], and 379 kilometers (235&nbsp;mi) with [[Turkmenistan]]. Major cities include, [[Astana]] (capital since [[December 1997]]), [[Almaty]] (the former capital), [[Karaganda]], [[Shymkent]] (Chimkent), [[Semey]] (Semipalatinsk) and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]]. 
[[Image:Syrdrya River.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Kyzylorda]]
The terrain extends west to east from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Altay Mountains]] and north to south from the plains of [[Siberia|Western Siberia]] to the oasis and desert of [[Central Asia]]. The [[Kazakh Steppe]], with an area of around 804,500 square kilometres (310,600&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi), occupies one-third of the country and is the world's largest dry [[steppe]] region. The steppe is characterized by large areas of [[grassland]]s and sandy regions. Important rivers and lakes include: the [[Aral Sea]], [[Ili River]], [[Irtysh River]], [[Ishim River]], [[Lake Balkhash]], and [[Lake Zaysan]]

The climate is [[continental climate|continental]], with cold summers and colder winters. Precipitation varies between arid and semi-arid conditions.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Kazakhstan]]''
[[Image:Modern Almaty.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A bustling economy]]
The government of Kazakhstan plans to double its [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) by [[2008]] and triple by [[2015]] compared to [[2000]]. The GDP growth was stable in the last five years, and was higher than 9% (the second fastest growing economy in the world in real terms). Analysts estimate a 9.3% growth rate for [[2005]]. The GDP growth in 2004 was 9.4%. Kazakhstan's economy grew by 9.2% in [[2003]], buoyed by high world [[crude oil]] prices. GDP grew 9.5% in [[2002]]; it grew 13.2% in [[2001]], up from 9.8% in 2000.

Kazakhstan's [[monetary policy]] has been well managed. Its principal challenges in 2002 were to manage strong foreign currency inflows without sparking [[inflation]]. In 2003 inflation did not remain under control, registering at 6.8% instead of the forecast level of 5.3%-6.0%. In 2002 inflation was 6.6%, compared to 6.4% in 2001. Because of its strong [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] performance and financial health, in 2000 Kazakhstan became the first former Soviet republic to repay all of its debt to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), 7 years ahead of schedule. In March 2002, the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] graduated Kazakhstan to [[market economy]] status under [[Trade Act of 2002|U.S. trade law]]. The change in status recognized substantive market economy reforms in the areas of currency convertibility, wage rate determination, openness to foreign investment, and government control over the means of production and allocation of resources.

In September 2002, Kazakhstan became the first country in the former [[Soviet Union]] to receive an investment-grade [[credit rating]] from a major international credit rating agency. As of late December 2003, Kazakhstan's gross foreign debt was about $22.9 billion. Total governmental debt was $4.2 billion. This amounts to 14% of the GDP. There has been a noticeable reduction in the ratio of debt to GDP observed in past years; the ratio of total governmental debt to GDP in 2000 was 21.7%, in 2001 it was 17.5%, and in 2002 it was 15.4%.

The upturn in [[economic growth]], combined with the results of earlier [[tax reform|tax]] and financial sector reforms, dramatically improved government finances from the 1999 [[budget deficit]] level of 3.5% of GDP to a deficit of 1.2% of GDP in 2003. Government revenues grew from 19.8% of GDP in 1999 to 22.6% of GDP in 2001, but decreased to 16.2% of GDP in 2003. In 2000, Kazakhstan adopted a new [[tax code]] in an effort to consolidate these gains. On November 29, 2003 the Law on Changes to Tax Code was adopted, which reduced [[Tax rates around the world|tax rates]]. The [[value added tax ]] fell from 16% to 15%, the social tax from 21% to 20%, and the personal [[income tax]] from 30% to 20%. Kazakhstan furthered its reforms by adopting a new land code on June 20, 2003 and a customs code on April 5, 2003.
[[Image:Kazah tenge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Tenge]], Kazakhstan's currency]]
[[Energy]] is the leading economic sector. Production of crude oil and [[natural gas]] condensate in Kazakhstan amounted to 51.2 million [[ton]]s in 2003, which was 8.6% more than in 2002. Kazakhstan raised oil and gas condensate exports to 44.3 million tons in 2003, 13% higher than in 2002. Gas production in Kazakhstan in 2003 amounted to 13.9 billion cubic meters (491 billion&nbsp;[[cubic foot|cu.&nbsp;ft]]), up 22.7% compared to 2002, including natural gas production of 7.3 billion cubic meters (258 billion&nbsp;[[cubic foot|cu.&nbsp;ft]]); Kazakhstan holds about 4 billion tons of proven recoverable oil reserves and 2,000 [[cubic kilometer]]s (480&nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu&nbsp;mi]]) of gas. Industry analysts believe that planned expansion of oil production, coupled with the development of new [[oil field|fields]], will enable the country to produce as much as 3 million barrels (477,000 m³) per day by [[2015]], lifting Kazakhstan into the ranks of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations. Kazakhstan's 2003 oil exports were valued at more than $7 billion, representing 65% of overall exports and 24% of the GDP. Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable [[oil reserves]] are [[Tengiz]] with 7 billion barrels (1.1 km³); [[Karachaganak]] with 8 billion barrels (1.3 km³) and 1,350 km³ of natural gas); and [[Kashagan]] with 7 to 9 billion barrels (1.1 to 1.4 km³).

Kazakhstan instituted an ambitious [[pension]] reform program in 1998. As of January 1, 2005 the pension assets were about $4.1 billion. There are 16 saving pension funds in the republic. The State Accumulating Pension Fund, the only state-owned fund, could be [[Privatization|privatized]] as early as 2006. The country's unified financial regulatory agency oversees and regulates the pension funds. The pension funds' growing demand for quality investment outlets triggered rapid development of the debt [[securities]] market. Pension fund capital is being invested almost exclusively in corporate and government [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], including Government of Kazakhstan Eurobonds. The Kazakhstani banking system is developing rapidly. The banking system's capitalization now exceeds $1 billion. The National Bank has introduced deposit insurance in its campaign to strengthen the banking sector. Several major foreign banks have branches in Kazakhstan, including [[ABN AMRO]], [[Citibank]], and [[HSBC]].

===Agriculture===
[[Image:Kazakhstan 1960s.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kazakhstan is one of the world's largest producers of grain]]
[[Agriculture]] accounted for 13.6% of Kazakhstan's GDP in 2003. [[Grain]] (Kazakhstan is the sixth-largest producer in the world) and [[livestock]] are the most important agricultural commodities. Agricultural land occupies more than 846,000 square kilometres (32,700&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi). The available agricultural land consists of 205,000 square kilometres (79,000&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) of arable land and 611,000 square kilometres (236,000&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) of [[pasture]] and hay land. Chief livestock products are [[dairy product]]s, [[leather]], [[meat]], and [[wool]]. The country's major crops include [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[cotton]], and [[rice]]. Wheat [[export]]s, a major source of [[hard currency]], rank among the leading commodities in Kazakhstan's export trade. In 2003 Kazakhstan harvested 17.6 million tons of grain in gross, 2.8% higher compared to 2002.

===Natural resources===
Natural resources are very abundant in Kazakhstan, not only by the quantity of specific resources, such as [[petroleum]], but also in the different elements found. Out of 110 chemical elements 99 are present, and 60 are being extracted. The deposits of oil, gas, [[titanium]], [[magnesium]], [[tin]], [[uranium]], and [[gold]] are some of the biggest in the world. Significant deposits of [[coal]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] are also present. Kazakhstan holds 300 gold deposits and is the 6th largest supplier of gold in the world. It is also an exporter of [[diamond]]s. Large deposits of [[chemical]]s are also present. [[Petroleum]], [[natural gas]], and mineral exports have attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993.

In total, there are 160 deposits with over or 2.7 billion tons of petroleum. Oil explorations have shown that the deposits on the [[Caspian sea|Caspian shore]] are only a small part of a huge oil deposit. It is said that 3.5 billion tons of oil and 2.5 trillion cubic meters of gas could be found in that area. Overall the estimate of Kazakhstan's oil deposits is 6.1 billion tons. However, there are only 3 [[refinery|refineries]] within the country, situated in [[Atirau]], [[Pavlodar]], and [[Shymkent]]. These are not capable of processing all of the produced crude oil, so most of it is exported to Russia

==Foreign relations==
[[Image:Victor Yushchenko and Nursultan Nazarbayev.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kazakhstan has good relations with its neighbours - 
[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] with [[Viktor Yushchenko]] ]]
Kazakhstan has stable relationships with all of its neighbors and is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and [[Organization of the Islamic Conference ]](OIC). It is an active participant in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) Partnership for Peace program. Kazakhstan is also a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO) and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] along with Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan established the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] in 2000 to re-energize earlier efforts at harmonizing trade tariffs and the creation of a free trade zone under a customs union.

Since independence in 1991, Kazakhstan has pursued what is known as the multidimensional foreign policy (многовекторная внешняя политика), seeking equally good relations with two large neighbors, Russia and China, and the United States and the West generally. The policy has yielded results in the oil and gas sector, where companies from the U.S., Russia, China, and Europe are present at all major fields, and in the multidimensional directions of oil export pipelines out of Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan possesses the Soviet equivalent to the United States' [[Cape Canaveral]], where the [[Soviet Union]] launched its version of the space shuttle and the well-known space station [[Mir]]. Russia currently leases approximately 6,000 square kilometres (2,300&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) of territory enclosing the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] space launch site in south central Kazakhstan.


On June 18, 2006, Kazakhstan joined the club of the world's space powers in its own right when it launched its first commercial satellite, KazSat 1, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on a Russian built booster rocket. [http://today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-06-18T011523Z_01_L18747512_RTRUKOC_0_US-SPACE-KAZAKHSTAN.xml]

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Kazakhstan]]''
[[Image:Kazakh shepard with dogs and horse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kazakh sheperd in Aktobe]]
The majority of modern Kazakhstanis are currently either ethnic [[Kazakhs]] (58%-60%) or [[Russians]] (25%-27%), with smaller [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Uzbek]], [[German people|German]], [[Uyghur]], [[Korean people|Koreans]] and other minorities totalling 15%-17%.  There is also a small but visible Jewish community. Before 1991, one million [[Volga Germans]] lived in Kazakhstan; much of this community emigrated to [[Germany]] following the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]].  Main religious groupings are [[Sunni Islam]], [[Russian Orthodoxy]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox church|Ukrainian Orthodoxy]].  

Kazakhstan is a bilingual country: the [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] language, spoken by 64.4% of the population, has the status of the "state" language, while [[Russian language|Russian]] is declared the "official" language, and is used routinely in business.  

The 1990s were marked by the emigration of much of the country's Europeans, a process that began in the 1970s; this was a major factor in giving the autochthonous Kazakhs a majority along with higher Kazakh birthrates and ethnic Kazakh immigration from [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. In the early 21st century, Kazakhstan has become one of the leading nations in [[international adoption]]s.

In 2001, the Foreign Minister Borat made a documentary investigating British and American lifestyles. It has become a mandatory part of education in Kazakhstan. 

===Kazakhs and Kazakhstanis (terminology)===
For many years, Russians often outnumbered the Kazakhs in many parts of the area known today as Kazakhstan. Even now, Russians and people of other ethnic origins play an important role in the economy, government, etc. At the same time, many non-Kazakhs still commonly refer to Kazakhstan as the homeland of the Kazakhs, and consider countries such as Russia or Germany their true "homeland" (interestingly, many Russians and other ethnic groups have been living in the region for several generations). Many non-Kazakhs, however, consider the country their home, and some resent their role as "outsiders" since the fall of the Soviet Union. A term was coined in Russian to describe any citizens of Kazakhstan including non-Kazakhs (казахстанец), which in English is usually rendered "Kazakhstani". In its correct usage, the word "Kazakh" should only refer to people of actual Kazakh descent (including those living in China, Afghanistan, and other Central Asian countries). A term that better grasps the people in the country as a whole, as well as their collective culture and land is "Kazakhstani". The name Kazakh, both for the people and for the nation itself, is derived from the ancient Turkic words "ka" which means "great" and "sak" which means the name of ancient tribe and the [[Avestan]]/[[Old Persian]](See [[Indo-European languages]]) word "stan" which means "land" or "place of". It is the result of Kazakhs' nomadic horseback culture and is related to the term "[[cossack]]", Saxon and Anglo-Saxon.

==Education==
Education is universal and mandatory through the secondary level, and the [[literacy]] rate is 98.8%.  Primary education lasts for four years preceded by one year of pre-school education. Secondary education consists in three main educational phases: primary education (forms 1-4), basic general education (forms 5-9) and senior level education (forms 10-11 or 12) divided into continued general education and professional education. These three levels of education can be followed in one institution or in different ones (e.g. primary school, then secondary school). Recently, several secondary schools, specialized schools, magnet schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, linguistic and technical gymnasiums, have been founded. Secondary professional education is offered in special professional or technical schools, lyceums or colleges and vocational schools.

At present, there are universities, academies, and institutes, conservatories, higher schools and higher colleges. There are three main levels: basic higher education that provides the fundamentals of the chosen field of study and leads to the award of the Bachelor degree; specialized higher education after which students are awarded the Specialist's Diploma; and scientific-pedagogical higher education which leads to the Master's Degree. Postgraduate education leads to the Kandidat Nauk (Candidate of Sciences) and the Doctor of Sciences.  With the adoption of the Laws on Education and on Higher Education, a private sector has been established and several  private institutions have been licensed.
