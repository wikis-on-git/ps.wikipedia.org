'''Pharmacy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''φάρμακον'' = drug) is the [[profession]] charged with ensuring the safe use of [[medication]]. Traditionally, pharmacists have compounded and dispensed medications on the orders of physicians. More recently, pharmacy has come to include other services related to [[patient care]] including clinical practice, medication review, and drug information. Some of these new pharmaceutical roles are now mandated by law in various [[legislature]]s. [[Pharmacist]]s, therefore, are drug therapy experts, and the primary health professionals who optimize medication management to produce positive health-outcomes.

The [[symbol]]s most commonly associated with pharmacy are the [[mortar and pestle]] and the ℞ (''[[Rx|recipere]]'') character. Pharmacy organisations often employ other elements, such as the [[Bowl of Hygieia]], [[conical measure]]s, and [[caduceus]]es in their [[logos]]. Other symbols are common in different countries such as the green [[Greek cross]] in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]], and the [[Gaper]] in [[The Netherlands]].

==اصول==
The field of Pharmacy can generally be divided into three main disciplines:
*[[Pharmaceutics]]
*[[Pharmaceutical chemistry]] (often [[Medicinal chemistry]])
*[[Pharmacy practice]]

The boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut; and often, collaborative teams from various disciplines research together.

[[Pharmacology]] is sometimes considered a fourth discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Therefore it is usually considered to be a field of the broader [[science]]s.

There are various specialties of pharmacy practice. Some specialisation is based on the place of practice including: community, hospital, [[consultant pharmacist|consultant]], [[locum]], drug information, regulatory affairs, industry, and academia. Other specialisations are based on clinical roles including: nuclear, oncology, cardiovascular, infectious disease, diabetes, nutrition, geriatric, and psychiatric pharmacy.

==Pharmacists==
:''Main article:'' [[Pharmacist]]

[[Pharmacist]]s are highly-trained and skilled healthcare professionals who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients. Many pharmacists are also [[small business|small-business]] owners, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. This unique [[dichotomy]] is often the subject of debate within the profession—in part due to the perception of pharmacists as "common shopkeepers" by many in the community.

Pharmacists are represented internationally by the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP). They are represented at the national level by professional organisations such as the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] (RPSGB), the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Australia]] (PSA) and [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA).
In some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the [[ethics]] of the profession. Since the [http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk Shipman Inquiry], there has been a move in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to separate the two roles.

==Separation of prescribing from dispensing==
In most jurisdictions (such as the [[United States]]), [[pharmacist]]s are regulated separately from [[physician]]s. Specifically, the legislation stipulates that the practice of prescribing must be separate from the practice of dispensing. These jurisdictions also usually specify that ''only'' pharmacists may supply scheduled [[pharmaceutical]]s to the public, and that pharmacists cannot form business [[partnership]]s with physicians or give them "kickback" payments.

In the minority of [[jurisdiction]]s (particularly in [[Asian]] such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]), [[Physician|doctor]]s are allowed to dispense [[medication|drug]]s themselves and the [[practice]] of pharmacy is integrated with that of the [[physician]].

The reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest. Otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in "diagnosing" as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient. Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have [[side-effects]].

A campaign for separation has begun in many countries and has already been successful (like in [[Korea]]). As many of the remaining nations move towards separation, resistance and lobbying from dispensing doctors who have percuniary interests may prove a major stumbling block (e.g. in [[Malaysia]]).

==Community Pharmacy==
A '''pharmacy''' (commonly the '''chemist''' in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]; or '''drugstore''' in [[North America]]; or [[Apothecary]], historically) is the place where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy where the dichotomy of the profession exists&mdash;health professionals who are also retailers.

Community pharmacies usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary where medications are stored and dispensed. The dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, ''etc.'', specified in legislation. Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications; there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained [[pharmacy technician]]s while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients.

All pharmacies are required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when open. In many jurisdictions, it is also a requirement that the owner of a pharmacy must be a registered pharmacist (R.Ph.). This latter requirement has been revoked in many jurisdictions, such that many [[retailer]]s (including [[grocery store]]s and [[mass merchandiser]]s) now include a pharmacy as department of their store.

==Hospital Pharmacy==
Pharmacies within [[hospitals]] differ considerably from community pharmacies. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues whereas pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues. 

Unlike community pharmacies, which are usually independently owned, hospital pharmacies can usually be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Traditionally, hospital pharmacies have also prepared various injectable preparations, such as saline, [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), and other drug infusions; but there has been a trend to [[outsource]] these functions to specialised pharmaceutical companies.

==Internet Pharmacy==
Recently, a number of pharmacies have begun operating over the [[internet]]. Many such pharmacies are, in some ways, similar to community pharmacies; the primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient than traveling to a community drugstore.

Some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription. Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the "inconvenience" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There have also been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.

In the [[United States]], there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from [[Canada]] and other countries, in order to reduce consumer costs. Although importation of prescription medication currently violates [[FDA]] regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.

==The future of pharmacy==
In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists will be paid for their cognitive skills. This paradigm shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in [[Australia]] receive remuneration from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. Many universities are altering their programs to increase emphasis in fields such as pharmacotherapeutics, clinical pharmacy, nuclear pharmacy, disease state management, etc. In Great Britain, pharmacists (and nurses) who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights.
