In the late [[7th century]] a branch of the [[Bulgars]] led by [[Khan]] [[Asparuh]] migrated into the northern [[Balkans]], where they merged with the local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population and possibly remnants of the [[Thracian]] population to form the first Bulgarian state in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;681. This was the first Slavic nation-state in history. The Bulgarian empire was a significant European power in the [[9th century|9th]] and the [[10th century]], while fighting with the [[Byzantine Empire]] for the control of the Balkans. The Bulgarian state was crushed by an assault by the ''[[Kievan Rus'|Rus']]'' in 969 and completely subdued by a determined Byzantine assault under [[Basil II]] in 1018. 

It was re-established in 1185 and continued to be an important power in the European south-east for two more centuries by fighting to assert its place in the region with the [[Byzantine Empire]], imposing defeats on the Crusader states in Greece, as well as [[Hungary]]. By the end of the [[14th century]] the country was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A liberation attempt by the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Hungary|Hungarian]] forces under the rule of [[Wladislaus III of Poland]] was crushed in 1444 in the [[battle of Varna]].

An autonomous Bulgarian principality in its ethnic borders was proclaimed by the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] of [[March 3]], [[1878]], following the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]]. The treaty was, however, not accepted by the [[Great Powers]] for fear that a large Slavic country on the [[Balkans]] would serve Russian interests. This led to the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] which provided for an autonomous Bulgarian principality comprising [[Moesia]] and the region of [[Sofia]]. Most of [[Thrace]] was included in the autonomous region of [[Eastern Rumelia]], whereas the rest of Thrace along with the whole of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] was returned under the sovereignty of the [[Ottomans]]. After [[Unification of Bulgaria|uniting]] with [[Eastern Rumelia]] in 1885, the principality was proclaimed a fully independent kingdom in 1908. The struggle for liberation of the [[Bulgarians]] in the [[Adrianople]] Vilayet and Macedonia continued throughout the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century culminating with the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]] organised by the [[IMARO]] in [[1903]].

In [[1912]] and [[1913]] Bulgaria became involved in the [[Balkan Wars]], entering into conflict first against the Ottoman Empire and then against its former Balkan allies in desperate effort to achieve its national unity. After being defeated in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria lost most of the territory conquered in the first war, as well as [[Southern Dobruja]]. During [[World War I]],  Bulgaria found itself fighting on the losing side after its alliance with the [[Central Powers]]. The defeat led to new territorial losses (the [[Western Outlands]] to [[Serbia]], [[Western Thrace]] to [[Greece]] and again the re-conquered [[Southern Dobruja]] to [[Romania]]. The Balkan Wars and World War I led to the influx of over 250,000 Bulgarian refugees from [[Macedonia]], [[Eastern Thrace|Eastern]] and [[Western Thrace]] and [[Southern Dobruja]]. After regaining control over [[Southern Dobruja]] in [[1940]], Bulgaria allied with the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]]. Bulgaria, however, did not participate directly in the war. It also saved the lives of its own 50,000 [[Bulgarian Jews]] from the [[Nazi]] [[death camp]]s by refusing to comply with a [[31 August]] [[1943]] resolution, which demanded their deportation to [[Auschwitz]].

Bulgaria fell within the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sphere of influence after World War II and became a [[People's Republic]] in 1946 and Moscow's staunchest ally. From the late 1970s it began normalising its relations with Greece and from the 1990s with Turkey. Communist domination ended in 1989, when Bulgaria again held multiparty elections, but economic difficulties and a tide of corruption led to over 600,000 Bulgarians, most of them qualified professionals, to emigrate.

Bulgaria joined [[NATO]] on [[29 March]], [[2004]] and is set to join the [[European Union]] at the earliest on [[1 January]], [[2007]] after signing the [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Treaty of Accession]] on [[25 April]] [[2005]].

== سياست ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Bulgaria]]''

=== Executive ===

The [[president of Bulgaria]] ([[Georgi Purvanov]] since [[22 January]] [[2002]]) is directly elected for a 5-year term with the right to one re-election. The president serves as the [[head of state]] and commander in chief of the armed forces. The president is the head of the Consultative Council for National Security and while unable to initiate [[legislation]], the President can return a bill for further debate, though parliament can overturn the president's veto with a simple majority vote. 

The Council of Ministers is chaired by the Prime Minister ([[Sergey Stanishev]] since [[17 August]] [[2005]]), and is the principal body of the Executive Branch and presently consists of 20 ministers. The Prime Minister is nominated by the largest parliamentary group and is given a mandate by the President to form a cabinet.

The current governmental coalition is made of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), [[National Movement Simeon II]] ([[NMS]]), and the [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] (representing mainly the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minority).

=== Legislative ===
The Bulgarian [[unicameral]] [[parliament]], the National Assembly or [[Narodno Sabranie]], consists of 240 deputies who are elected for 4-year-term stretches by popular vote. The votes are for party or coalition lists of candidates for each of the twenty-eight administrative divisions. A party or [[coalition]] must garner a minimum of 4% of the vote in order to enter parliament. Parliament is responsible for enactment of laws, approval of the budget, scheduling of presidential elections, selection and dismissal of the [[prime Minister of Bulgaria|prime minister]] and other ministers, declaration of war, deployment of troops outside of Bulgaria, and ratification of international treaties and agreements. 

The last elections took place on June 2005. The next elections are planned for summer 2009.

=== Judiciary ===
The Bulgarian judicial system consists of regional, district and appeal courts, as well as a Supreme Court of Cassation. In addition, there is a Supreme Administrative Court and a system of military courts. The Presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation, Supreme Administrative Court and the Prosecutor General are elected by a qualified majority of two thirds from all the members of the Supreme Judicial Council and are appointed by the President of the Republic. The Supreme Judicial Council is in charge of the self-administration and organisation of the Judiciary. 

The Constitutional Court is in charge of reviewing the constitutionality of laws and statutes brought before it, as well as the compliance of these laws with international treaties that the Government has signed. Parliament elects the 12 members of the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds majority, the members serve a nine-year term.

=== Regional and local government ===
The territory of the Republic of Bulgaria is divided into regions and municipalities. In all Bulgaria has 28 regions, each headed by a regional governor appointed by the government. In addition, there are 263 municipalities.

[[دوتنه:Bu-map.png|right|Map of Bulgaria]]

Bulgaria is comprised of portions of the classical regions of [[Thrace]], [[Moesia]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The southwest of the country is mountainous and includes the highest peak of the Balkan Peninsula, peak [[Musala]] at 2,925 metres (9,596&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]); the range of the [[Balkan mountains]] runs west-east through the middle of the country, north of the famous [[Rose Valley]]. Hilly country and plains are found in the southeast, along the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea]] coast in the east, and along Bulgaria's main river, the [[Danube]] in the north. Other major rivers include the [[Struma River|Struma]] and the [[Maritsa|Maritsa river]] in the south.

The Bulgarian [[climate]] is [[temperate climate|temperate]], with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers.

The [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] derives its name from the ''Balkan'' or ''[[Stara Planina]]'' mountain range which runs through the center of Bulgaria into eastern [[Serbia]].

== اقتصاد ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Bulgaria]]''

Bulgaria's economy contracted dramatically after 1989 with the loss of the market of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON) member states, to which the Bulgarian economy had been closely tied. The [[standard of living]] fell by about 40%, but it regained pre-1990 levels in June 2004. In addition, [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Iraq]] took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] grew and [[inflation]] fell. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed due to lack of international economic support and an unstable banking system. Since 1997 the country has been on the path to recovery, with GDP growing at a 4-5% rate, increasing FDI, macroeconomic stability and [[EU]] membership set for 2007.

The former government, elected in 2001, pledged to maintain the fundamental economic policy objectives adopted by its predecessor in 1997, i.e., retaining the Currency Board, practicing sound financial policies, accelerating [[privatisation]], and pursuing structural reforms. Economic forecasts for 2005 and 2006 predict continued growth in the Bulgarian economy. The annual year-on-year GDP growth for 2005 and 2006 is expected to total 5,3% and 6,0%, respectively. Industrial output for 2005 is forecast to rise by 11,9% year-on-year, and for 2006 - by 15,2% year-on-year. Unemployment for 2005 is projected at 11,5% and for 2006 - at under 10%.

On [[April 25]], [[2005]] Bulgaria signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Treaty of Accession]] with the [[European Union]] and is set to join the bloc in 2007.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Bulgaria]]''

[[دوتنه:Bulgarien 0905.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The [[Rila Monastery]] is one of Bulgaria's most important cultural and historical monuments]]
According to the 2001 [[census]], Bulgaria's population is mainly [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]] (83.9%), with two sizable minorities, [[Turkish people|Turks]] (9.4%) and [[Roma and Sinti|Roma]] (4.7%). Of the remaining 2.0%, 0.9% are distributed among some forty smaller minorities, the most numerous of which are the [[Armenians]], [[Russians]], [[Vlachs]], [[Crimean Tatars in Bulgaria|Crimean Tatars]], [[Karakachans]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Jew]]s; the people who have not declared their ethnicity are 1.1% of the total population. 

In the period between [[1985]] and [[1989]], the communist government of Bulgaria attempted to forcefully assimilate the country's Turkish minority. After the introduction of the new laws in 1985, the Bulgarian government banned Turkish education and sought to erase Turkish culture and identity. Turkish names were forcefully changed to slavic ones and some 200,000 ethnic Turks emigrated permanently to Turkey in light of heavy persecution. These laws were removed after the change to democracy in the early months of [[1990]].

[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], is the mother-tongue of 84.8% of the population; it is a member of the [[Slavic languages]]. Bulgarian is the only official language, but other languages are spoken, corresponding closely to ethnic breakdown.

Most Bulgarians (82.6%) are, at least nominally, members of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], the national [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] church. 
Other religious denominations include [[Islam]] (12.2%), various [[Protestant]] denominations (0.7%), [[Roman Catholicism]] (0.5%),  with other denominations, atheists and undeclared numbering ca. 4.1%.

[[دوتنه:AlexanderNevskiCathedral.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]] in Sofia is one of the biggest Orthodox cathedrals in Europe.]]
Most citizens of Bulgaria belong, at least nominally, to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]]. It was was founded in 870 AD under the Patriarchate of Constantinople from which it obtained its first primate, its clergy and theological texts. It has been [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] since 927. The Bulgarian Patriarchate was established in Sofia after the creation of the Bulfarian Exarchate, in 1870. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the independent national church of Bulgaria like the other national branches of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and is considered an inseparable element of Bulgarian national consciousness. The church became subordinate within the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]], twice during the periods of Byzantine (1018-1185) and Ottoman (1396-1878) domination but has been revived every time as a symbol of Bulgarian statehood without breaking away from the Orthodox dogma. In 2001, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church had 6,552,000 members in Bulgaria (82.6% of the population). However many people raised during the 45 years of [[communist]] rule are not religious even though they formally may be members of the church.

Despite the dominant position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church in Bulgarian cultural life, a number of Bulgarian citizens belong to other religious denominations, most notably [[Islam in Bulgaria|Islam]], [[Roman Catholicism in Bulgaria|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism in Bulgaria|Protestantism]]. [[Islam in Bulgaria|Islam]] came to Bulgaria at the end of the [[14th century]] after the conquest of the country by the [[Ottomans]]. It gradually gained ground throughout the 15th and 16th centuries by the introduction of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] colonists and  the conversion of ethnic Bulgarians. At the time of Liberation (1878) no less than 40% of the population of the country was [[Muslim]], but emigration was a key factor in reducing this percentage. In 2001, there were 967,000 [[Muslims]] in Bulgaria (12.2% of the population).

In the 16th and the 17th century missionaries from Rome converted the Bulgarian [[Paulicians]] in the districts of [[Plovdiv]] and [[Svishtov]] to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Today, their descendants form the bulk of Bulgarian Catholics whose number stands at 44,000 in 2001. 
[[Protestantism]] was introduced in Bulgaria by missionaries from the United States in 1857. Missionary work continued throughout the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. In 2001, there were some 42,000 [[Protestants]] in Bulgaria.
