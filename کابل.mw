'''Kābul''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: '''کابل'''), is the [[capital]] and largest city in [[Afghanistan]], with population of about 3 million people. It is an economic and cultural center, situated 5,900 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (1,800 m) above-sea-level in a narrow valley, wedged between the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains along the [[Kabul River]]. Kabul is linked with [[Ghazni]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]] and [[Mazari Sharif]] via a long beltway (circular highway) that stretches across the country. It is also linked by highways with [[Pakistan]] to the southeast and [[Tajikistan]] to the north.

Kabul's main products include [[munition]]s, [[cloth]], [[furniture]], and [[beet sugar]], though, since [[1978]], a state of nearly continuous war has limited the economic productivity of the city.

Kabul is over 3,000 years old. Many empires long fought over the city, due to its strategic location along the trade routes of [[Southern Asia|Southern]] and [[Central Asia]]. In 1504, [[Babur]] captured Kabul and made the city the capital of his [[Moghul Empire]]. Finally, in [[1776]], [[Timur Shah Durrani]] made it the capital of modern Afghanistan.<ref>Britannica Concise Encyclopedia - ''Kabul''...[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368810 Link]</ref> The population of the city is [[multicultural|multi-cultural]] and [[multiethnic|multi-ethnic]], reflecting the diversity of the entire country. Kabul is currently in the process of being rebuilt following decades of wars and chaos.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transport ===
[[Kabul International Airport]] serves the population of the city as a method of traveling to other cities or countries. The airport is a hub to [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], which is the national airlines carrier of Afghanistan. However, airlines from other nations also use the airport to arrive and depart. A new $35 million dollar terminal for international flight passengers, near the old terminal, is under construction and will be completed by 2008.<ref>Pajhwok Afghan News - ''Work on terminal at Kabul Airport starts''...[http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&id=27666 Link]</ref>

[[Image:Airport Road in Kabul City.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Airport Road in the Wazir Akbar Khan district of the city.]]

Kabul has its own public buses (Millie Bus) that take [[commuters]] on daily routes to many destinations throughout the city. The service currently has approximately 800 buses but is gradually expanding and upgrading with more buses being added. Plans are underway to re-introduce the modern [[electric bus]]es that the city once had. Besides the buses, there are yellow [[taxicab]]s that can be spotted just about anywhere in and around the city.

Private vehicles are also on the rise in Kabul, with [[Toyota]], [[Land Rover]], [[BMW]] and [[Hyundai]] dealerships all over the city. More and more people are buying new cars as the roads and highways are being improved. The average car driven in Kabul is a [[Toyota Corolla]]. With the exception of motorcycles many vehicles in the city operate on diesel fuel.

=== Communications and technology ===
GSM/GPRS mobile phone services in the city are provided by [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Roshan (Telecom)|Roshan]] and [[Areeba]], and all have boasted increase in rapid cellular phone usage. In June 2006, [[Etisalat]] announced the acquisition of a mobile phone operator's licence from the Afghan government and its intention to build a country-wide mobile phone network. In November 2006, the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications]] signed a [[US Dollar|US]] 64.5 million dollar agreement with a company (ZTE Corporation) on the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services not just in Kabul but throughout the country.<ref> Pajhwok Afghan News - ''Ministry signs contract with Chinese company''...[http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&id=26882 Link]</ref>

Local (Afghanistani) television channels include:

*[[Ayna TV]] 
*[[Ariana TV]] 
*[[Khorasan TV]] (soon to be broadcast to Kabul from United States)
*[[Lamar TV]]
*[[Noorin TV]]
*[[Tamadun TV]]
*[[Shamshad TV]]
*[[Tolo TV]] 
*[[Radio Kabul|Afghanistan National TV]]

=== Reconstruction and developments ===
As of October 2006, there are fourteen licensed banks in Kabul: including [[Da Afghanistan Bank]], [[Afghanistan International Bank]] (managed by the Dutch ING Bank), [[Standard Chartered Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Punjab National Bank]], [[Habib Bank]] and others. [[Western Union]] offices are also found in many locations throughout the city.

A modern indoor shopping mall ([[Kabul City Center]]) with a 4-star (Safi Landmark) hotel on the top six floors opened in 2005. A 5-star [[Serena Hotel]] also opened in 2005. Another 5-star [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]] is under construction, which is scheduled for completion in 2007. The landmark [[InterContinental Hotel, Kabul|InterContinental Hotel]] has also been refurbished and is in operation.

[[Image:KABULCITYMAP.jpg|thumb|200px|The plan for Kabul's nine billion dollar future modern urban development project, the ''[[City of Light Development]]''.]]

An initial concept design called the [[City of Light Development]], envisioned by Dr. [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]], Principal of [[ARCADD, Inc.]] for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue,<ref>Kabul - City of Light Project...[http://www.cityoflight-kabul.com/p11.htm link]</ref> revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the [[Afghan National Museum]]. Dr. Ashkouri has signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with His Excellency Ambassador [[Said Tayeb Jawad]] in Washington, DC to undertake this project and to develop it for actual implementation over the next 20 to 25 years. Dr. Ashkouri has presented the City of Light Plan to President Karzai and has received a letter of support from the President and the Minister of Urban Development in support of this project’s development.

About {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} from downtown Kabul, in [[Bagrami District|Bagrami]], a {{convert|22|acre|ha|0|sing=on}} wide industrial complex has completed with modern facilities, which will allow companies to operate businesses there. The park has professional management for the daily maintenance of public roads, internal streets, common areas, parking areas, 24 hours perimeter security, access control for vehicles and persons. Another phase with additional {{convert|27|acre|ha|0}} of land will be added immediately proceeding the first phase.<ref>Afghanistan Industrial Parks Development Authority...[http://www.aisa.org.af/IPD/Bagrami.htm Kabul (Bagrami)]</ref>

[[Image:New Building Blocks in Kabul City.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Construction of new building blocks in the city.]]

The city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center giving children a chance to live their childhoods and develop a sense of hope. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor’s office, and the international [[NGO]] [[Glocal Forum]] serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.

Launched in [[2004]], the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the [[Quincy Jones]] Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the [[World Bank]], [[UN]] agencies and major companies.

A $25 million Coca-Cola bottling plant was opened in 2006. Financing was provided by a Dubai-based Afghan family. President Hamid Karzai formally opened the facility in an attempt to attract more foreign investment in the city.

==Administration==
Kabul City is one of the 15 districts of [[Kabul Province]], and is divided into 18 '''sectors'''. Each sector covers several neighborhoods of the city. The number of Kabul's sectors were increased from 11 to 18 in 2005. 

Unlike other cities of the world, Kabul City has two independent councils or administrations at once: [[Prefecture]] and [[Municipality]]. The [[Prefect]] who is also the [[Governor]] of Kabul Province is appointed by the [[Ministry of Interior]], and is responsible for the administrative and formal issues of the entire province. The [[Mayor]] of Kabul City is selected by the [[President of Afghanistan]], who engages in the city's planning and environmental work.

The police and security forces belong to the prefecture and Ministry of Interior. The Chief of Police is selected by the Minister of Interior and is responsible for law enforcement and security of the city.

[[Image:Kabul.PNG|thumb|289px|پلازمېنه|کابل]]
'''کابل''' د [[افغانستان]] پلازمېنه ده. دا سيمه د افغانستان ختيځ لور ته پرته ده او د افغانستان د څلوردېرشو ولايتونو څخه يو ولايت ګڼل کېږي. د کابل ولايت مرکز د کابل ښار په نامه يادېږي او همدا ښار د سمندر د سطحې نه ۱۸۰۰ متره په لوړه کې پروت دی او په همدې توګه دا يو د هغو پلازمېنو څخه دی چې په نړۍ کې تر ټولو لوړه سطحه موقعيت لري. د ۱۳مې پېړۍ په پيل کې کابل په ټوله نړۍ کې د زده کړو ځای او د ښکلو ځايونو په کتار کې شمېرل کېده. خو د هماغه وخت نه راپدېخوا د بېلابېلو جګړو او تاريخي ناورينونو، او د باندنيو ځواکونو د يرغل وروسته کابل ړنګ شو. کابل د افغانستان يو ګڼ فرهڼيز ښار دی چې د حکومت اداري مرکزيت هم همدلته دی. ددغه ښار اوسينی ښاروال [[حاجي دين محمد]] دی.

== جغرافيه ==
[[Image:Mountains of Kabul.jpg|thumb|250px|Kabul City]]
Kabul is located between Latitude 34-31' North and Longitude 69-12' East at an altitude of 1800 m (6000 feet) above sea level, which makes it one of the world's highest capital cities. Kabul is strategically situated in a valley surrounded by high mountains at crossroads of north-south and east-west trade routes. One million year ago the Kabul region was surrounded from south-east between  [[Lowgar]] and [[Paghman]] Mountains; [[Charikar]] in the north and the Ningai Ghar mountains in the west. This region formed an icy sea. In the Silurian time, at the end of ice era, the icebergs are melted gradually and the territory of this region was poured by water under heavy raining. Some deep wells in the region of today's Poli Charkhi in the east part of city are the evidence of that time. Kabul is surrounded by [[Koh-e Paghman]] Mountain from the east, [[Koh-e Qrough]] Mountain from the south-west, [[Koh-e Shirdarwaza]] Mountain from the north-east. Kabul has only one river which is called [[Kabul River]]. Kabul River rises at the Paghman Mountain toward South Pass about 70 km (45 miles) west of Kabul. It flows in an easterly direction, past Kabul, and through [[Jalalabad]] city, and then on to [[Dakka]] where it enters Pakistani territory and finally runs into the Indus at [[Attock]].

The climate within region of Kabul is considered to be [[Desert|arid]] to [[semi-arid]] [[steppe]]. Because of the very low amounts of precipitation, especially from May to November, Kabul can be very dry and dusty. Extreme temperature changes occur from night to day, season to season, and from place to place. The chief characteristic of Afghanistan's climate is a blue cloudless sky with over 300 days of sunshine yearly. Even during the winter, skies usually remain clear between snowfalls, which are on average 15 to 30cm annually. The daily temperature in winter is -15 to -20 degrees [[Celsius]] (°C), and in summer +15 to +30°C. The coldest month of the year is January when the average temperature is -12°C, and the hottest month is July when the average is 25°C. The maximum temperature has been recorded as +36.9°C in July and the minimum as -21.7°C in February.

Kabul City is thought to have been established between 2000 [[BCE]] and 1500 BCE.<ref>''The history of Afghanistan'', [http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html Ghandara.com website]</ref> In [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] (composed between 1700–1100 BCE) the word "''Kubhā''" is mentioned, which refers to [[Kabul River]] and a reference to the settlement Kabura by the [[Persians|Persian]] [[Achaemenids]] around 300 BCE. Kabul was known as ''Chabolo'' in antiquity {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. [[Image:Kabul Walls.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A view of Kabul City's walls, built between 650 and 670 CE by [[Kushano-Hephthalites|Kabul-Shahan]]]]

According to other scholars, the [[Sanskrit]] name of Kabul is derived from [[Kamboja|Kamboj]].<ref>''Supplementary Glossary, p. 304, H. M. Elliot''</ref> It is mentioned as ''Kophes'' or ''Kophene'' in the [[Classics|classical]] writings. ''Gazetteer of Bombay Presidency 1904'' maintains that the ancient name of Kabul was ''Kambojapura'', which [[Ptolemy]] (160 [[Common Era|CE]]) mentions as ''Kaboura'' (from ''Ka(m)bo(j)pura?''). [[Hiuen Tsang]] refers to the name as ''Gaofu'', which according to Dr. J. W. McCrindle, Dr. B. C. Law, Dr. R. K. Mukkerji and others is equivalent to [[Kambojas]] (''Kamboj/Kambuj''). The [[Bactria]]ns founded the town of [[Paropamisadae]] near Kabul, but it was later ceded to the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryans]] in the 1st century BCE.

Kabul (Kaofeu) was conquered by the first [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] Emperor, [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the early 1st century CE and remained Kushan territory until at least the 3rd century CE.<ref> Hill, John E. 2004. ''The Western Regions according to the Hou Hanshu.'' Draft annotated English translation...[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/hou_han_shu.html link]</ref><ref> Hill, John E. 2004. ''The Peoples of the West from the Weilue'' 魏略 ''by Yu Huan'' 魚豢'': A Third Century Chinese Account Composed between 239 and 265 CE.'' Draft annotated English translation... [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/weilue/weilue.html Link]</ref> Kabul was one of the two capital cities of Kushans. It was later conquered by the [[Hephthalites]] in 425 CE followed by the [[Hindu]] [[Shahi]]s. After their defeat, their descendants formed a small dynasty called [[Kushano-Hephthalite|Kabul-Shahan]]. The leaders of Kabul-Shahan built a long defensive wall around the city to protect it from possible attacks or invasions. This wall has survived until today and is considered as an old historical site. 

In 674, the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic invasions]] reached modern-day Afghanistan and occupied Kabul. However, it was not until the 9th century when [[Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar]], a coppersmith turned ruler, established [[Islam]] in [[Kabulistan]]. Over the remaining centuries to come the city was successively controlled by the [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghorids]], [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughols]], [[Durrani Empire|Durranis]], and finally by the [[Barakzai]]s. 

In the [[13th century]] the [[Mongols|Mongol]] horde passed through. In the [[14th century]], Kabul rose again as a trading center under the kingdom of [[Timur|Timur Lung]] (''Tamer Lane''), who married the sister of Kabul's ruler at the time. But as Timurid power waned, the city was captured in [[1504]] by [[Babur]] and made into his headquarters. [[Haidar]], an [[India]]n poet who visited at the time wrote "Dine and drink in Kabul: it is mountain, desert, city, river and all else."

[[Nader Shah]] of Persia captured the city in 1738 but was assassinated nine years later. [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], an Afghan military commander and personal bodyguard of Nader, took the throne in [[1747]], asserted [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] rule and further expanded his new [[Durrani Empire|Afghan Empire]]. His son [[Timur Shah Durrani]], after inheriting power, transferred the capital of Afghanistan from [[Kandahar]] to Kabul in [[1776]].<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica - ''The Durrani dynasty (from Afghanistan)''...[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-21396/Afghanistan Link]</ref> Timur Shah died in 1793 and was succeeded by his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani]].

In 1826, the kingdom was claimed by [[Dost Mohammed]] and taken from him by the [[British Indian Army]] in 1839 (see [[Afghan Wars]]), who installed the unpopular puppet [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]]. An 1841 local uprising resulted in the loss of the British mission and the subsequent [[Massacre of Elphinstone's army]] of approximately 16,000 people, which included civilians and [[camp follower]]s on their retreat from Kabul to [[Jalalabad]]. In 1842 the British returned, plundering [[Bala Hissar]] in revenge before retreating back to [[India]]. Dost Mohammed returned to the throne.

The British invaded in 1878 as Kabul was under [[Sher Ali Khan]]'s rule, but the British residents were again massacred. The invaders again came in 1879 under [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|General Roberts]], partially destroying Bala Hissar before retreating to India. [[Amir Abdur Rahman]] was left in control of the country.

In the early 20th century, King [[Amanullah Khan]] rose to power. His reforms included electricity for the city and schooling for girls. He drove a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]], and lived in the famous [[Darul Aman Palace]]. In 1919, after the Third Anglo-Afghan War, Amanullah announced Afghanistan's independence from [[foreign affairs|foreign interventions]] at [[Id Gah Mosque|Eidgah Mosque]]. In 1929, Ammanullah Khan left Kabul due to a local uprise and his brother [[Mohammad Nadir Shah|Nader Khan]] took control. King Nader Khan was assassinated in 1933 and his 19 year-old son, [[Mohammad Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], became the long lasting [[King of Afghanistan]]. [[Image:Downtown area of Kabul.jpg|thumb|left|280px|A section of downtown area during winter.]]

[[Kabul University]] opened for classes in early 1930s, and in 1940s, the city began to grow as an industrial center. The streets of the city began being paved in the 1950s.

In the 1960s, Kabul developed a cosmopolitan mood. The first [[Marks and Spencer]] store in [[Central Asia]] was built there. [[Kabul Zoo]] was inaugurated in 1967, which was maintained with the help of visiting [[Germany|German]] [[Zoology|Zoologists]].

In 1969, a religious uprising at the [[Pul-e Khishti Mosque]] protested the Soviet Union's increasing influence over Afghan politics and  [[Islam|religion]]. This protest ended in the arrest of many of its organizers including [[Mawlana Faizani]], a popular Islamic scholar.

In July 1973, Zahir Shah was ousted in a bloodless coup and Kabul became the capital of a republic under [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]], the new President.

In 1975 an east-west electric trolley-bus system provided public transportation across the city. The system was built with assistance from [[Czechoslovakia]].

After the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], on [[December 24]], [[1979]], the [[Red Army]] occupied the capital. They turned the city into their command center during the 10-year conflict between the Soviet-allied government and the [[Mujahideen]] rebels. The American [[Embassy]] in Kabul closed on [[January 30]], [[1989]]. The city fell into the hands of local [[militia]]s after the 1992 collapse of [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s pro-communist government. As these forces divided into warring factions, the city increasingly suffered. In December, the last of the 86 city trolley buses came to a halt due to the conflict. A system of 800 public buses continued to provide transportation services to the city.

[[Image:New Building Blocks in Kabul.jpg|thumb|200px|New building blocks in Kabul, which is part of a bigger plan to modernize the city and bring it to international standards.]]

By 1993 electricity and water in the city was completely out. At this time, [[Burhannudin Rabbani]]'s militia ([[Jamiat-e Islami]]) held power but the nominal prime minister [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]] began shelling the city, which lasted until 1996. Kabul was factionalised, and fighting continued between Jamiat-e Islami, [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and the [[Hezbi Wahdat]]. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed and many more fled as [[Afghan refugees|refugees]]. The [[United Nations]] estimated that about 90% of the buildings in Kabul were destroyed during these years.

Kabul was captured by the [[Taliban]] in September of 1996, publicly lynching ex-President [[Najibullah]] and his brother. During this time, all the fighting between different militias came to an end. Burhannudin Rabbani, Gulbuddin Heckmatyar, Abdul Rashid Dostum, [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], and the rest all fled the city.

Approximately five years later, in October 2001, the [[United States]] invaded Afghanistan. The Taliban abandoned Kabul in the following months due to extensive American bombing, while the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] (former mujahideen or millias) came to retake control of the city. On [[December 20]], [[2001]], Kabul became the capital of the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]], which transformed to the present [[government of Afghanistan]] that is led by US-backed President [[Hamid Karzai]]. 

Since the beginning of [[2003]], the city is slowly developing with the help of foreign investment. Security is also improving by the year, despite the occasional attacks on government forces.

Kabul has been long known for its politics and different [[warlord]]s. It was under the control of many political groups and warlords when Mohammad Najibullah's government collapsed. Kabul city was in the hands of many political groups who fought for power until it was taken over by the [[Taliban]] in 1996 and its politics was changed. Kabul's politics become more aligned with the Islamic regime and new laws were introduced by the Taliban. There was only one leader for Afghanistan [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], the head of Taliban who ran Kabul's political party until the US invaded on [[October 7]], [[2001]]. New laws and humanities came in effect to enable Kabul to recover from the destruction caused by the Taliban. [[Loya Jirga]] took place to solve the current political problems and situations in Kabul and introduce new laws. Kabul citizens have been given the right to vote.

After being re-scheduled twice, Afghanistan's presidential [[elections]] were held on [[October 9]], [[2004]]. Over 8 million Afghans voted in the elections. The [[Joint Electoral Management]] Body of Afghanistan certified the elections on November 3rd, and declared [[Hamid Karzai]], the interim President, the winner with 55.4% of the vote. Karzai's strongest opponent, Yunis Qanooni, received 16.3% of the vote. The elections were not without controversy; allegations of fraud and ballot stuffing were brought up by many of the presidential candidates including Yunis Qanooni. Many felt that Hamid Karzai had an unfair advantage over the other candidates as he had access to financial and logistical resources that many of the other candidates did not have. A panel of international experts was set up to investigate the matter. The panel did find evidence of voting irregularities, however, they said that it was not enough to affect the outcome of the elections. Some people claimed that they were forced to vote for the current president and some claim that they were paid to do so. 

With help from the United States and the United Nations, Afghanistan adopted its new constitution, establishing the country as an Islamic Republic, in early January 2004. According to the constitution, the Afghan government consists of a powerful and popularly elected President, two Vice Presidents, and a National Assembly consisting of two houses: the House of People ([[Wolesi Jirga]]), and the House of Elders ([[Meshrano Jirga]]). There is also an independent Judiciary branch consisting of the Supreme Court ([[Stera Mahkama]]), [[High Courts]] and [[Appeal Courts]]. The President appoints the members of the Supreme Court with the approval of the Wolesi Jirga. Assembly elections were planned for late 2005.

Most of Kabul's economy depended on its tourists in the 1960s and 1970s. Kabul had textile, cotton production, and carpet production industries, but most of its economy came through tourism which it lost during its destruction. Kabul's produces include: natural gas, cotton, wool, carpets, agriculture, and some small production companies. Kabul has trade partnerships with the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[USA]], [[India]], [[South Korea]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kenya]], [[Russia]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Iran]]. Kabul's economy was influenced by the American power and has increased by almost 3500% after being down for 25 years. A new currency was introduced to Afghans which helped the economy. New business was in the new regime. Many American industries were interested in the new Kabul and many new companies have since then opened their branches in Kabul.  The Kabul City Centre Mall was built and has nearly 100 shops. [http://www.iwpr.net/?p=arr&s=f&o=257693&apc_state=heniarr200511]
The economy is in a boom level and is increasing dramatically. Home costs are going up as well as wages of employees. The cost of living has increased dramatically which is a problem for the non-educated Afghans, who cannot support themselves. The UN also helps Afghans in need of help by providing aid, food and school materials for schools. Many international aid organizations are contributing to the Afghanistan economy.

== ډيموګرافي ==
Kabul is a mosaic of ethnic groups although the majority of its population speak the [[Persian language]] (usually of the [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] dialect). There is also a significant number of [[Pashto|Pashto-speakers]] as well. Bilingualism is common in the area because of the large movements of people from other provinces into Kabul Province.

The ethnic [[Tajiks]] make up the largest percentage of the population of the province, while there are other important minorities like [[Pashtun]]s [[Hazara people|Hazara]]s, [[Uzbeks]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]s, [[Baloch]]s, [[Sikh]]s and [[Hindu]]s that are found mainly in the capital city. 

About 85% of the population is [[Sunnite]] while 14% include [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ite]]s. [[Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism]] form the remaining 1%.

Transportation in Kabul is improving as the numbers of new vehicles and experienced drivers are increasing. There is public transportation service in the Kabul vicinity, but many roads are in disrepair. Drivers are also impeded by the large number of cyclists. More vehicles are seen in the city because people are purchasing cars. Taxi cabs are found everywhere in the city, also in most of the districts of Kabul.

Kabul's Milli Bus (National Bus) system, which has about 200 buses, provides service to the city and nearby areas. There are several new highways in the province, and the government has scheduled to rebuild most of the smaller roads. Funding for the roads comes from current drivers who must pay toll charges for driving on highways and major roads. The money is collected by the government through issuing motorists monthly, quarterly or annual inspection certificates that are affixed to the windshield of their vehicles. 

Trucks are used to transport goods from one district to another, or to other cities of the country. The Afghan government, with the help of foreign companies or organizations, have begun work on many of Kabul's roads. Auto companies like [[Honda]], [[Toyota]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chevrolet]] have also been reintroduced in Kabul.

Kabul is Afghanistan's center for education. People from all over the world, including from all the provinces of the country come to Kabul for education. There are many schools and universities that have opened doors for men and women. In the 1970s, about 55% of Kabul's population was educated without materials or proper learning resources to get a proper education. Most of the young children are sent to work by their parents to support their living costs. The education rate has declined dramatically during the last 20 years. Most of the schools in Kabul were set as battle points during the wars and have been demolished. 

Kabul's education level is going up now by the help of many international organizations, and more people are being sent back to schools to get a degree. The value of education is being reintroduced in the communities, and they are encouraged to send their children to schools for a better education and a better life. Most of the people of Afghanistan, who took refuge in Pakistan, Iran and India, have returned to Kabul with their degrees and been able to obtain better jobs. Most of them are contributing their knowledge to the community by opening new courses and institutes. According to [[UNICEF]], Kabul's education level is in a boom now and is getting better and better.

Kabul is the center of annual [[Buzkashi]] and [[Soccer]] tournaments, where teams from all over [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] participate. Sports is a daily routine for employees in Afghanistan, when they all join each other in tournaments and matches, specially soccer games. Afghanistan's Soccer Team also participated in many Asian Soccer Leagues. Many Afghans who were living as refugees in [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] returned back to their country, and they brought the game of [[cricket]] with them. Afghanistan now has national Cricket Team that plays internationally. They play mostly against Pakistani and Hindi Teams as well as some Arab nations in the Middle East. 

There are [[Boxing]], [[Taekwondo]], [[Volleyball]], and [[Kung fu]] teams in Kabul, which participate in tournaments locally and go on tours to other Asian countries. One of the oldest and most popular stadiums in Kabul is [[Ghazi Stadium]], where tournaments, concerts, and national celebrations take place, however the city has lost most of the stadiums it previously had. Ghazi Stadium is currently going through a reconstruction programme whereby a new design and a new system will be established for the stadium. There is also another new stadium under construction near Kabul City. Schools and universities encourage participation in team sports, and there is a group of Afghans are being trained in Kabul for the next [[Olympic Games]].
