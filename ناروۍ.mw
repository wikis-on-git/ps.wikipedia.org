== تاريخ ==
:''Main article: [[History of Norway]]''

Archeological finds indicate that there were people in Norway about [[10th millennium BC|12,000 years ago]]. They probably came from more southern regions, that is northern [[Germany]], and travelled further north along the Norwegian coastline.

In the [[9th century]], Norway consisted of a number of [[petty kingdom]]s. According to tradition, [[Harald Fairhair]] gathered the small kingdoms into one in 872 with the [[battle of Hafrsfjord]].  He became the first king of a united Norway.

The [[Viking]] age ([[8th century|8th]] to [[11th century|11th centuries]]) was one of unification and expansion. The Norwegians established settlements on [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]] and parts of the British Islands, and attempted to settle at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]], [[Canada]] (it is the [[Vinland]] of the ''[[Saga of Eric the Red]]'').  Norwegians founded the modern-day [[Ireland|Irish]] cities of [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford City|Waterford]] and established trading communities near the [[Celt]]ic settlements of [[Cork]] and [[Dublin]] which later became Ireland's two most important cities.

In [[1349]], the [[Black Death]] wiped out between ⅓ and ⅔ of the Norwegian population, causing a decline in both society and economics.  During this decline, the [[Fairhair dynasty]] died out in [[1387]]. Royal politics at the time resulted in several personal unions between the Nordic countries, eventually bringing the thrones of Norway, [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]] under the control of Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe]] when the country entered into the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark and Sweden.  Sweden declared its independence in [[1523]], but Norway remained under the Danish crown until [[1814]].  During the [[national romanticism]] of the [[19th century]], this period has sometimes been referred to as the "400-Year Night", since all of the kingdom's royal, intellectual, and administrative power was centred in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.  Other factors also contributed to Norway's decline in this period. With the introduction of [[Protestantism]] in [[1537]], Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of [[Olav II of Norway|St. Olav]] at the [[Nidaros]] shrine, and with them, much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of [[Europe]].  Additionally, Norway saw its land area decrease in the [[17th century]] with the loss of the provinces [[Bohuslän|Båhuslen]], [[Jämtland|Jemtland]], and [[Härjedalen|Herjedalen]] to Sweden, as a result of the wars between [[Denmark-Norway]] and Sweden.

After Denmark-Norway was attacked by [[England]], it entered into an alliance with [[Napoleon]], and in [[1814]] found itself on the losing side in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and in dire economic conditions. The Dano-Norwegian [[Oldenburg]] king was forced to cede Norway to the king of [[Sweden]]. Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on [[American constitution|American]] and [[French constitution|French]] models, and elected the Danish crown prince [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian Fredrik]] as king on [[May 17]] [[1814]].  However, Sweden militarily forced Norway into a [[personal union]] with Sweden, establishing [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] as king of Norway (as '''Carl II'''). Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and independent institutions, except for the foreign service. See also [[Norway in 1814]].

This period also saw the rise of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] cultural movement, as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character.  The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature ([[Henrik Wergeland]], [[Maurits Christopher Hansen]], [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]], [[Jørgen Moe]], [[Henrik Ibsen]]), painting ([[Hans Gude]], [[Adolph Tiedemand]]), music ([[Edvard Grieg]]), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today's two official written forms for [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]; [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]].

[[Christian Michelsen|Peter Christian Hersleb Kjerschow Michelsen]] (March 15, 1857 – June 29, 1925), a Norwegian shipping magnate and statesman, was Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907. Michelsen is most known for his central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on [[June 7]] [[1905]], and was one of Norway's most influential politicians of his day.  Norway's growing dissatisfaction with the union with Sweden during the late 19th century, combined with National Romanticism and the awakening sense of nationality contributed to the dissolution of the union. The Norwegian government offered the throne of Norway to the Danish Prince Carl. After a referendum confirming the monarchy, the Parliament unanimously elected him king. He took the name of [[Haakon VII]], after the medieval kings of independent Norway. In [[1913]], Norwegian women gained [[suffrage]].

Norway was a neutral country during [[World War I]]. Norway also attempted to claim neutrality during [[World War II]], but was invaded by German forces on [[April 9]], [[1940]] ([[Operation Weserübung]]). The Allies also had plans to invade Norway, in order to take advantage of her strategically important Atlantic coast, but were thwarted by the German operation. Norway put up a stiff fight against the German occupation and armed resistance in Norway went on for two months. The battle of [[Vinjesvingen]] eventually became the last stronghold of Norwegian resistance in southern Norway in May, while the armed forces in the north surrendered in early June. King Haakon and the Norwegian government continued the fight from exile in [[Rotherhithe]], [[London]]. On the day of the invasion, the collaborative leader of the small National-Socialist party [[Nasjonal Samling]] — [[Vidkun Quisling]] — tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority, ''Reichskommissar'' [[Josef Terboven]]. Quisling, as ''minister president'', later formed a government under German control. During the five years of [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation]], Norwegians built a strong [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance movement]] which fought the German occupation forces with both armed resistance and civil disobedience. Notable was also the effort of the Norwegian Merchant Navy. At the time of the invasion Norway had the third largest, fastest and the most effective Merchant Navy in the world. It was lead by the Norwegian shipping company Nortraship under the allied force throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the evacuation of Dunkirk to the Normandy landings. 

In [[1944]], the Germans evacuated the provinces of [[Finnmark]] and northern [[Troms]], using a [[scorched earth]] tactic to create a vast area of ''No-man's land'' in response to the [[Red Army]] attacking their positions in eastern Finnmark. The Soviets attacked eastern Finnmark to create a buffer zone after pushing the German forces out of the arctic [[Kola peninsula]]. The Russians peacefully returned the area to Norwegian control after the war. The German forces in Norway surrendered on [[May 8]] [[1945]].

The [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation during World War II]] disturbed the Norwegians' confidence in neutrality, and they turned instead to [[collective security]]. Norway was one of the signatories of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] in [[1949]] and was a founding member of the [[United Nations]], providing its first secretary general – [[Trygve Lie]]. Norway has twice voted against joining the [[European Union]] (in [[1972]] and [[1994]]), but is associated with the EU via the [[European Economic Area]]. However, Norway is a member of the much smaller [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).

Norway is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] of [[government]].

The Royal House is a branch of the princely family of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|Glücksburg]], originally from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in [[Germany]]. As it stands, however, the functions of the King, [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]], are mainly ceremonial, but he has influence as the symbol of national unity. Although the [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] of [[1814]] grants important executive powers to the King, these are almost always exercised by the [[Government of Norway|Council of State]] in the name of the King (King's Council, or cabinet). The reserve powers vested in the Monarch by the [[constitution]] are  significant and an important security part of the role of the [[Monarchy]], and were last used during [[World War II]]. The Council of State consists of a [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] and his council, formally appointed by the King. [[Parliamentarism]] has evolved since [[1884]] and entails that the cabinet must not have the parliament against it, and that the appointment by the King is a formality.

[[دوتنه:Stortinget,_Norway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Stortinget, Oslo]]

The Norwegian [[parliament]], [[Stortinget]], currently has 169 members (increased from 165, effective from the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|elections of 12 September 2005]]). The members are elected from the 19 [[counties of Norway|counties]] for 4-year terms according to a system of [[proportional representation]]. The Storting divides itself into two chambers, the ''[[Odelsting]]'' and the ''[[Lagting]]'' when voting on legislation. Laws are proposed by the government through a Member of the Council of State or by a member of the Odelsting and decided on by the Odelsting and Lagting, in case of repeated disagreement by the joint Storting. However, in modern time the Lagting rarely disagrees and mainly just [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber-stamps]] the Odelsting's decision. Before the present Storting is a proposed constitutional amendment which would repeal the division.

Impeachment cases are very rare (the last being held in [[1927]] when prime minister [[Abraham Berge]] was acquitted) and may be brought against Members of the Council of State, or of the Supreme Court or of the Storting, for criminal offences which they may have committed in their official capacity. Indictments are raised by the Odelsting and judged by the Lagting and the Supreme Court justices as part of the High Court of the Realm. Apart from this, the Storting functions as a [[unicameral]] parliament.

The regular courts include the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]] or ''Høyesterett'' (18 permanent judges and a [[chief justice]]), courts of appeal, city and district courts, and conciliation councils. Judges attached to regular courts are appointed by the [[Government of Norway|King in council]] after nomination by the Ministry of Justice. The special High Court of the Realm, which consists of the Supreme Court plus the Lagting, hears [[impeachment]] cases.

In order to form a government, more than half (currently at least 10 out of 19 members) of the Council of State are required to belong to the [[Church of Norway]].

[[دوتنه:reine-3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Reine, Lofoten, seen from top of Reinebringen (June, 2003).]]

The landscape is generally rugged and mountainous, with several major [[glacier]]s occupying central mountain plateau.  Its coastline of over 83,000 kilometres (51,575&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) <ref>[http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/norway/environment/032091-991558/dok-bn.html Information from the Government and Ministries of Norway]</ref> is punctuated by steep-sloped inlets known as [[fjord]]s, as well as a multitude of [[island]]s and [[islet]]s. The northern part of the country is also known as the ''Land of the Midnight Sun'' because of its location north of the [[Arctic Circle]], where for part of each summer the sun does not set, and in winter much of its land remains dark for long periods. In summertime in the southern part of Norway, the sun is only away for a few hours.

Norway is bounded by seas of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]]: the [[North Sea]] to the southwest and its large inlet the [[Skagerrak]] to the south, and the [[Norwegian Sea]] to the west. In the northeast is the [[Barents Sea]], part of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. To the east, in order from south to north, it shares a long border with [[Sweden]], a shorter one with [[Finland]], and a still shorter one with [[Russia]].  Norway's highest point is the [[Galdhøpiggen]] at 2,469 metres (8,100&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]). With a maximum depth of 514 metres (1,686&nbsp;ft), [[Hornindalsvatnet]] is Norway's and [[Europe]]'s deepest lake.

The Norwegian [[climate]] is fairly [[temperate climate|temperate]], especially along the coast under the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. The inland climate can be more severe and to the north more [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] conditions are found, especially in [[Finnmark]].

Norway is the home of several famous playwrights and novelists, among others [[Ludvig Holberg|Baron Ludvig Holdberg]],  [[Henrik Ibsen]],  [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] and more recently, [[Jon Fosse]], and [[Georg Johannesen]], The playwright/novelists [[Knut Hamsun]] and [[Sigrid Undset]], have both won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in [[1920]] and [[1928]]  respectively. Norway is the homeland of [[Expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Edvard Munch]] and the sculptor [[Gustav Vigeland]] and [[romanticism|romanticist]] [[composer]] [[Edvard Grieg]].  Many Norwegians have explored the farthest corners of the world, i.e. [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]], and [[Thor Heyerdahl]].

Composers [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Ole Bull]], [[Christian Sinding]] and [[Arne Nordheim]] are recognised contributors to the [[Music of Norway]]. Among the contributors to pop music are [[A-ha]], [[Röyksopp]], [[Motorpsycho]] and [[Turbonegro]].  Norway is known for its large contributions to music, particularly in the [[black metal]] scene.  Where such bands as [[Darkthrone]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Burzum]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Gorgoroth (band)|Gorgoroth]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] have all made a name for themselves.

Norwegians celebrate their national day on [[May 17]], the [[Norwegian Constitution Day]]. Many people wear [[bunad]] (which are traditional costumes or modern costumes, based on at least some traditional designs) and a majority of the nation (especially children and the [[Russ]]) watch or participate in the town parades taking place all over the country, a tradition founded by the poet [[Henrik Wergeland]].  The day was originally a celebration of national independence by the middle and upper class, while the working class celebrated [[1 May]]. However, during the social democratic rule after [[World War II]] it became a major public feast, celebrated by all social classes. Attempts to make the day more political - especially in the 70's - have not had much effect.

The Norwegian language has two official written forms: [[bokmål]] and [[nynorsk]]. Additionally [[riksmål]] is much used, e.g. in press and literature. 

Non-Norwegian languages like Sami and Finnish are also used in northernmost Norway by ethnic minorities.

که څه هم د نورون لرغونې ژبه په څو ګړدودونو(لحجو)  وېشل کېږي چې ټول هاغه خلک کوم چې په سکېنډيناويايي  سيمو کې اوسېدل او اوسيږي هرې سيمې ځانته ګړدود درلوده اوتر اوسه ېې دا لړۍ روانه ده. خو دلته يوازې د ناروې د سيمې نورون لرغونې ژبه څېړو. دا لړۍ له 700م پېر نه تر 1350م پېر پورې رسېږي .د نورون ژبې ته زړه ايسلېنډي ژبه هم وېل کېږي دا ځکه چې په هغه پېرکې د نورون ژبې ډېری ليکلي اسار له ايسلېنډ نه پلاس راغلي، او هاغه پېر ته ناروېژيان د ناروېژيانواوايسلېنډيانو يو ګډژبني اوفرهڼګي پېرهم وايي . دې سره سره په ناروې کې چې د نورون لرغونې ژبې کوم اسار پلاس راغلي نو دوی ورته زړه ناروېژي هم وايي ځکه چې په ناروې کې ېې هم د نورون ژبې يوګړدود(لحجه) پاتې و اوله هغو څخه څو ليکلي اسار ترلاسه شوي .  ناروېژيان پدې اند دي چې ددوی پخوانی نسل چې وايکنګز ( د درياب غله ) نومېدل دشمالي سکېنډيناويا په لور لاړل او خپل ځانوته ېې له ايسلېنډ نه نيولې تر فرويا او ورپسې نورو شمالي سيمو کې مځکې په زور ونيولې او همدلته مېشته شول. وايکنګان ډېرياغيان ، چپاولګران او غله و.او دوی وايي چې همدا وايکنګان و چې دغه نورون ژبه ېې کوله اوپدو کې هم څو ګړدودونه و.  په همدې نورون کې دلرغوني پېر کړکيسې پاتې دي چې ډېری ېې د ليکلو په بڼه ترلاسه شوي . چې لاپورې ېې ليکوال څرګند نه دی. پدې اساروکې ځينې د ډبرليک په بڼه ځينې  ېې دپاڼو په بڼه پاتې شوي چې ورته خپل خپل نومونه هم لري . پدې لرغونو اسارو کې د سيمو د بزګرانو کيسې،دهغوی ځينې نومونه او په هکله نور معلومات د شعر په بڼه راغونډ دي. لرغونپوهان وايي چې دا اسار په 1200 مې او 1300 مې پېړۍ کې ليکل شوي. د نورون لرغونې ژبه له اوسينۍ دواړوناروېژي ګړدودونو سره ډېر لوی توپير لري. خوبيا برعکس د نورون لرغونې ژبه له اوسينۍ ايسلېنډۍ  ژبې سره ډېر ورته والی لري.

=== د ناروېژي ژبې دوهم پېر (1500ز. - 1850ز.) ===
له 1500مې پېړۍ نه تر1814مې پېړۍ پورې د ناروې په نوم ځانته هر اړخيزه خپلواکه هېواد نه موندل کېده.  په اوسينۍ  ناروې باندې د ډنمارک برلاسيتوب لورايه ښکاره کېده. ډنمارکي او سويډني ژبو د ځينو سيمه ايزو ناروېژي ګړدودونو سره سم به لکه کنډيباغي وېل کېده خو د ليکلو په بڼه به ډانمارکي چلېده. پدې ګډوډو ګړدودونو کې نه يوازې ډانمارکي او سويډني برلاسيتوب درلود بلکې د ايسلېنډي ژبې بنسټيزه ريښې هم لورايه ښکارېدې ورسره د جرمني ژبې ډيری وييکي به دهمغه پېرځينوسيمه ايزوملکانو،مزهبي مشرانو، سوداګرواو کاتبانو کارولې، اومزهبي مشرانو به په ټولنه کې ډېررول درلود. دا لړۍ تر 1550م پورې  روانه وه کله چې په همدې کال کې په ډانمارکي ژبه کې بايبل (انجيل) راوواته او بيا دهمدې انجيل له کبله ناروېژيان د ليک او لوست جوګه شول. لدې نه وروسته د 1600مې نه تر 1700مې پېړۍ پېر د ډانمارکي ژبې لوړې ستحې معياري کېدل ګڼلای کېږي. دا ژبه به ناروېژيانو خپل په ګړدودونو سربېره کاروله، دا به د ناروېژي نسله مزهبي مشرانو په خولې کې لورايه ښکارېدله. ډېرو لږو خلکو نيمه سمه کارولی شوه. ډېرو به خپل په ګړدود غږېدل تر څو په 1814م کې ناروېژيانو د خپلواک هېواد لپاره هلې ځلې پېل کړې او د همدې کال د مۍ په 17مه نېټه ناروېژيانو پخپله يو اساسي قانون وليکه چې پکې ليکل شوي وو چې ناروې دې يو ازاده، خپلواک، او نه بېلېدونکی هېواد وي. که څه هم ناروې د ډنمارک له ولکې ووته خو د ډنمارک باچا دناروې واک او کړه وړه سويډن سره ګډ کړه اود سويډن باچا ته ېې د ناروې ټول واک وروسپاره. بيا ناروې د سويډن سره په ګډ واک کې تر 1905 م کاله پاته شوه.د ناروې دګډ واک لامل ېې ډېر ناروېژيان د خپلو نالوستوب ، ساده ګي ، او پوره په سياست نه پوهېدنه ګڼي . د سويډن څخه په کال 1905 م کې بېلېدنه او يو خپلواک هېواد کېدنه د ناروې د خپلواکۍ ورځ ګڼل کېږي . خو رسمن په ناروې کې د اساسي قانون د رامنځته کېدو نېټه چې 17م د مۍ 1814 م نه حسابېږي په خوښۍ او چشن ېې لمانځي . همدا نېټه د ډانمارک له اوږدمحالي برلاسي حکومت نه د خلاسون نېټه ګڼل کېږي. د ناروېژي اوسيني دوه رسمي ګړدودونه چې منځ ته راغلي ناروېژيان ېې له 1800مې پېړۍ نه اټکلوي. چې دې اوسينۍ رسمي ژبو ته بوکمول او نينوشک وايي ، که څه هم دواړه ژبې يوازې سيمه ايز ګړدودونه دي وييکي ، ژبدود او ليکدود ېې يو ډول دی غير له ځينې ويونو او تلفظ کې چې توپير ښکاري او بس.

=== د ناروېژي ژبې درېېم پېر (له بوکمول نه تر نينوشک) ===
ناروېژي ژبه په دوه لويو ګړدودونووېشل شوې ده ، چې دواړه ګړدودونه ېې په دوه سيمو وېشل شوي او دا دوه ګړدودونه خپل خپل نومونه لري چې ورته بوکمول او نينوشک وايي . بوکمول د حکومت په رسمي چارو کې لوی رول لوبوي چې ورته هوووډ مول وايي چې لفظي مانا ېې رسمي او لومړنی حدف راوځي. او په څنګ کې ېې بله سيمه ايزه ژبه يا ګړدود (نينوشک)  ده چې ورته سيده مول وايي يعنې ورسره حدف په نوم يادېږي.  که څه هم دا دواړه ګړدودونه  د ناروې رسمي ژبې دي خو د ډانمارکي ژبې تر اغېزې لاندې راغلي او لومړی ګړدود چې بوکمول نومېږي ټوله د ډنمارکي تر اغېزې لاندې ده ،دا ځکه چې د بوکمول ژبې بنسټ ايښودونکی کنوډ کنوډسن ( زېږېدنه 1812..1895)  وروسته له 1850مې نه د ډانمارکي ژبې نه ناروېژي بوکمول ژبه جوړونه پېل کړه او يوازې د ژبې د تلفظ په برخه کې ېې توپيرونه ښکاري چې په ننۍ ناروېژي رسمي ژبې پېژندل شوې او ډېر وييکي ېې د وخت دبدلون سره نوي شوي هم دي.  نينوشک د ډانمارکي ژبې تر اغېزې ډېره کمه راغلې ، ځکه چې د نينوشک ژبې جوړونکی ايوار اوسن (زېږېدلی1813،1896) په کال 1842م نه تر 1848 پورې د نينوشک ژبې بنسټ کېښود. دا ژبه د ناروېژيانو په قول د ناروې له بېلابېلوګړدودونو نه جوړه شوې.  او بل يوازينی او ځانګړی توپير ېې له بوکمول سره په ژبدوديزه برخه کې په غږيزه او ليکدوديزه څانګه کې ښکاري .

=== مذهب ===
:''Main article: [[Religion in Norway]]''
Religion in Norway is overwhelmingly [[Protestant]] (Evangelical-Lutheran). Much due to a strong tradition of baptism, 89% of the population belong to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway]] which is the [[state religion|established religion]]. The Norwegians, like all of the peoples of Scandinavia, were pagans believing in [[Norse mythology]]; the [[Sámi]] having a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] religion. Due to the efforts of Christian missionaries, Norway was forcibly Christianised in a gradual process starting at approximately 1000 AD and which was substantially finished by 1150AD. Prior to the [[Reformation]], Norwegians were part of the [[Catholic Church]] with the conversion to Protestantism occurring in 1536. [[Islam]] is now the second  largest religion due to recent migration trends although the census shows that there are more people with no religious beliefs.

== Human rights in Norway ==
[[Freedom of expression]] is enshrined in paragraph 100 , [[Freedom of religion]] in paragraph 2 of the [[Constitution of Norway]], though many consider this compromised in practice by the establishment of a state church.  The press is not censored, but most editors adhere to self-imposed commandments of caution ("[[:no:Vær Varsom-plakaten|Vær Varsom-plakaten]]").
Public radio and TV broadcast mostly without interference from the government, although permission to broadcast depends on the programme spectrum.

The constitution forbids [[retroactive law]]s, punishment not based on laws and court decisions, and the use of [[torture]].
In 1999 the Human Right conventions of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]] were constituted as law in Norway, ''Menneskerettsloven''. [http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19990521-030.html]
However, Norwegian Lawyers as well as the Council of Europe's Committee Against Torture have expressed their concern about unwarranted imprisonment of criminal defendants and the use of solitary confinement in Norway, deeming it torture. [http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/article1274357.ece]
Also the treatment of refugees has been under discussion.

In 2005 the international conventions against discrimination of women and race discrimination were incorporated in, but not superior to, Norwegian law.
[[Amnesty International]] has recently focused on violence against women in Norway and shortage of public services to victims of violence. [http://www.amnesty.no/web.nsf/pages/71EA018C83278F58C125711D003A4239]

Norway has mandatory military service of 9-12 months for men between the ages of 18 (17 with parental consent) and 44. Conscientious objectors serve 12 months in an alternative civilian national service. If a candidate refuses to attend the check-up ("sesjon") they are liable to prosecution. If convicted, the objector is a [[prisoner of conscience]] by international standards{{fact}}.

Practising homosexuality was officially legalised in 1972; homosexual partnerships in 1993. According to Statistisk sentralbyrå (SSB) there were 192 homosexual partnerships recorded in 2004. Since 2002 it has become possible for homosexual partners to adopt each other's children from previous relationships, although joint adoption is still not allowed.

[[دوتنه:Map_Norway_political-geo.png|thumb|275px|left|يوه سياسي جغرافيکي نخشه, exhibiting its 19 first-order [[administrative division|subnational divisions]] (''fylker'' or "counties")]]

Norway is divided into 19 administrative regions, called ''fylker'' (singular ''fylke'') and 431 ''kommuner'' (singular ''kommune''). ''Fylke'' and ''kommune'' are officially translated to [[English language|English]] as ''[[county]]'' and ''[[municipality]]''. The ''fylke'' is the intermediate administration between state and municipality. Note: The 19 ''fylker'' might be replaced with 5 - 9 larger regions by 2010.

The [[counties of Norway]] are:
* [[Akershus]]
* [[Aust-Agder]]
* [[Buskerud]]
* [[Finnmark]]
* [[Hedmark]]
* [[Hordaland]]
* [[Møre og Romsdal]]

== اقتصاد ==
:''Main article: [[Economy of Norway]]''
[[دوتنه:henningsvaer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Henningsvær, a fishing village in Lofoten during fishing season (April, 2001).]]

The Norwegian economy is an example of [[mixed economy]], featuring a combination of [[free market]] activity and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the vital [[petroleum]] sector. The control mechanisms over the petroleum resources is a combination of state ownership in major operators in the Norwegian fields ([[Statoil]] ca 70% in [[2005]], [[Norsk Hydro]] 43% in [[2004]]) while specific taxes on oil-profits for all operators are set to 78%, finally the government controls licencing of exploration and production of fields. The country is richly endowed with natural resources: [[petroleum]], [[hydropower]], [[fish]], [[forestry|forests]], and [[minerals]]. Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world, partly from petroleum production but mainly from efficient economic policies, creating a good environment for doing business. Norway has a very high employment ratio. 

In 2004, oil and gas accounted for 50% of exports. Only [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Russia]] export more oil than Norway, which is not a member of [[OPEC]]. The last 30 years, the Norwegian economy has shown various signs of the economic phenomenon called [[Dutch disease]]. In response to Dutch Disease, and to concerns about oil and gas reserve depletions, in 1995 the Norwegian state started to put away the annual surplus in a fund, now called [[The Petroleum Fund of Norway|Government Petroleum Fund]]. The fund is invested in developed financial markets outside Norway. The fiscal strategy is to spend the "normal interest" of the fund each year, set to 4 per cent. By January 2006, the Fund was at USD 200 billion, representing 70 per cent of GDP in Norway. 

Norway opted to stay out of the [[European Union]] during a referendum in 1972, and again in November [[Norwegian EU referendum, 1994|1994]]. However, Norway, together with [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], participates in the [[EU]]'s single market via the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty, between the [[EU]] nations and the [[EFTA]] nations, EØS-loven [http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19921127-109.html], is constituted as superior law in Norway, which makes Norway a full member of EU's free trade market.

In [[2000]] the government sold one-third of the then 100% state-owned oil company [[Statoil]]. The [[economic growth]] was 0.8% in [[1999]], 2.7% in [[2000]], and 1.3% in [[2001]]. After little growth in [[2002]] and [[2003]], the economy expanded more rapidly in [[2004]].

Recent research shows early evidence of massive amounts of [[coal]] beneath the oil-reserves on the [[continental shelf]] of Norway.<ref>[http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/34152/story.htm www.planetark.com] - Research by graduate students of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]] and researchers at [[SINTEF]] in [[Trondheim]] </ref>. A rough estimate has been given at 3×10<small><sup>12</sup></small>&nbsp;[[tonne]]s of coal of unknown quality in these reserves. In comparison, the currently known coal reserves for the entire world is estimated at 0.9×10<small><sup>12</sup></small>&nbsp;tonnes. The coal is inaccessible today, but there are realistic hopes that it can be accessed in the future.

[[Animal rights]] and anti-[[whaling]] groups have commented that given Norway's economic position it is [[paradox]]ical that this is one of a very small number of countries actively engaged in, and favouring the continuation of, commercial whaling. This is despite the argued negligible contribution that whaling makes to the economy, and despite opposition from around the world ([http://www.wspa-usa.org/pages/543_norway_set_to_kill_more_whales.cfm]). Many supporters of whaling agree that its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] importance is negligible, but hold that the livelihood of individuals and small firms depend on it and that [[sustainable development]] depends on human [[harvest]]ing of all non-[[endangered species]] ([http://www.highnorth.no/]), and that it is an important part of [[culture]] in costal areas. Norway's whaling today is limited to the non-endangered [[Minke Whale]], whom are killed using explosive grenade harpoons, which also accounts for more than 90% of the catch in Norwegian waters since the 1920s ([http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=598156]).

1 Norwegian Krone = 0.159418442 U.S. Dollars

1 U.S. Dollar = 6.2728 Norwegian Kroner

1 Euro = about 7.99029264 Norwegian Kroner

As of Aug 16, 2006

== Demographics ==
:''Main article: [[Demographics of Norway]]''

[[دوتنه:Borgundstavkirke.jpg|thumb|[[Borgund stave church]]]]

The size of the Norwegian population is around 4.6 million and is increasing by 0.4% per year (estimate July 2004). [[Ethnicity|Ethnically]] most Norwegians are [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] / North [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], while small minorities in the north are [[Sami people|Sami]] or [[Finnish people|Finnish]] (see also [[Kven]]). The Sami are considered an indigenous people and traditionally live in the Northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. The largest concentration of Sami people is, however, found in Norway's capital [[Oslo]]. <!--In recent year it has been questioned if the Sami really were the first to populate Norway. If that's the case, it would make the ethnically Norwegians of Norse origin the oldest people in the country.--> <!--These two sentences need a reference. And since "indigenous" says very little about timelines, the new information fits better under history than demographics.-->

In recent years, [[immigration]] has accounted for more than half the population growth, and 7.9% of the population are immigrants as of [[1 January]] [[2005]]. The largest immigrant groups are [[Demographics of Pakistan|Pakistanis]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Demographics of Iraq|Iraqis]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Somalia|Somalis]]. (Here, immigrants are defined as persons with two foreign-born parents [http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/minifakta_en/en/minifakta.pdf].)

Approximately 86% of Norway's inhabitants are members of the state church, the [[Church of Norway|Evangelic Lutheran Church of Norway]]. Other [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations total about 4.5% (the [[Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Norway|Evangelical Lutheran Free Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal congregations]], the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]], etc). Among other religions, [[Islam]] is the largest in Norway with around 1.5%, and other religions comprise less than 1% each, (including [[Judaism]]; see [[Jews in Norway]]). Around 1.5% adhere to the secular [[Human-Etisk Forbund|Human Ethical Union]]. As of [[1 January]] [[2003]] approximately 5% of the population are unaffiliated ([http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/07/02/10/trosamf_en/]).

The [[Norwegian language]] has two official written forms, ''[[Bokmål]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]''. They have officially equal status, i.e. they are both used in public administration, in schools, churches, and on radio and television, but Bokmål is used by the majority. Around 95 percent of the population speak Norwegian as their native tongue, although many speak [[dialect]]s that differ significantly from the written language. Nevertheless, all of the Norwegian dialects are interintelligible. Several [[Sami languages]] are spoken and written throughout the country, especially in the north, by the [[Sami people]]. The [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Norwegian language and the [[Finno-Ugric]] Sami languages are entirely unrelated. However, the [[Finnish language]] is distantly related to the Sami language.
