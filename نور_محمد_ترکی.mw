'''نور محمد ترکی''' ([[۱۵ د جولای]]، [[۱٩۱۳]] - [[۱۴ سېپتمبر]], [[۱٩٧٩]]) د افغاني سياست يوه پېژندلې څېره، اماتور شاعر، او په ښکاره توګه يو مشهور انقلابی وه. نوموړی د ۱۹۷۸ زېږيز کال نه تر خپلې مړينې پورې د افغانستان ولسمشر پاتې شوی.

In the months following the coup, he and other party leaders initiated radical policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established power structures in the rural areas. He ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and a long history of resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control.

== پخواني وختونه، سياسي او شخصي ژوند ==

په ۱ د [[جنوري]]، [[۱۹۶۵]]، [[د افغانستان د خلق ډيموکراټيک ګوند]] بنسټ کېښوده. The PDPA, a communist party in fact if not in name, was established for the primary purpose of gaining parliamentary seats. The PDPA was comprised of a small group of men, followers of Nur Mohammad Taraki and [[ببرک کارمل]], both avowed [[Marxist-Leninists]] with a pro-Moscow orientation. 

Most observers described the 1965 elections as remarkably fair. Taraki was elected to Parliament in 1965, and started one of the first major leftist newspaper, [[Khalq]] (Masses), which lasted little more than a month before being silenced by a government ban.

In 1967 the PDPA split into two groups: [[Khalq]] (Masses) and [[Parcham]] (Banner) headed by '''Nur Muhammad Taraki''' and Babrak Karmal, respectively. The split reflected deep ethnic, class, and ideological differences. The Khalq faction was more militantly Marxist and somewhat more independent of the Soviet Union than the Parcham faction.

On [[April 19]], [[1978]] a prominent leftist, '''[[Mir Akbar Khyber]]''', was killed by the government of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]. His death served as a rallying point for the Afghan communists. Fearing a communist [[coup d'etat]], Daud ordered the arrest of certain PDPA leaders, including '''Taraki''' and Babrak Karmal, while placing others such as [[Hafizullah Amin]] under house arrest. 


On [[April 27]], [[1978]] the coup was initiated, reportedly by [[Hafizullah Amin]] while still under house arrest. Mohammed Daoud Khan was killed the next day along with most of his family. The PDPA rapidly gained control and on [[May 1]], '''Nur Mohammed Taraki''' became President. The country was then renamed the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] (DRA), installing a regime that would last, in some form or another, until [[April]] [[1992]].

Taraki became president, prime minister and General Secretary of the PDPA. However, the rivalry between the Khalq and Parcham factions continued. The Government was divided between President '''Nur Muhammad Taraki''' and Deputy Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin of the [[Khalq]] faction against [[Parcham]] leaders such as [[Babrak Karmal]] and [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. 

After three months, President Taraki sent the Parcham leaders to [[India]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]] as ambassadors. Babrak Karmal became the Ambassador to [[Czechoslovakia]] and his mistress, '''Anahita Ratebzad''', Ambassador to [[Yugoslavia]], while [[Mohammad Najibullah]] became Ambassador to [[Iran]]. Taraki then began to purge Parcham members from his government with many being arrested and executed. 

'''Barbrak Karmal''' was recalled but went into hiding with Anahita Ratebzad in the [[Soviet Union]] fearing execution if he returned; '''Muhammad Najibullah''' followed them. Taraki then stripped them of all official positions.  Amin became prime minister on [[28 March]], [[1979]] with Taraki remaining President.

On [[December 5]], [[1978]], he sponsored a friendship treaty with the [[Soviet Union]] (later used as a pretext for the Soviet invasion). Major uprisings occurred regularly against his government. During its first 18 months of rule, the PDPA brutally imposed a Marxist-style "reform" program, which ran counter to deeply rooted Afghan traditions. 

Decrees forcing changes in marriage customs and pushing through an ill-conceived land reform were particularly misunderstood by virtually all Afghans. In addition, thousands of members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment, and the intelligentsia were imprisoned, tortured, or murdered. 

Taraki was also responsable to introduce women to the political life. A prominent example was '''Anahita Ratebzad''', who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the '''Revolutionary Council'''. Ratebzad wrote the famous '''[[New Kabul Times]]''' editorial ([[May 28]] [[1978]]) which declared that ''Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country....Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention.'' 

Taraki as president of Afghanistan attended a conference of the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned nations]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. On his way back stopped in [[Moscow]] to meet with [[Leonid Brezhnev]].Taraki reached [[Moscow]] on [[March 20]], [[1979]] with a formal request for Soviet ground troops. 

[[Alexei Kosygin]], then Premier of the USSR, told him that ''We believe it would be a fatal mistake to commit ground troops... if our troops went in, the situation in your country... would get worse.'' Despite this statement Taraki negotiated some armed support - helicopter gunships with Russian pilots and maintenance crews, 500 military advisors, 700 paratroopers disguised as technicians to defend Kabul airport, also significant food aid (300,000 tons of wheat).

[[Brezhnev]] further warned Taraki that full Soviet intervention "would only play into the hands of our enemies - both yours and ours." Brezhnev also advised Taraki to ease up on the drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime. Finally, he advised Taraki to remove Prime Minister Amin.

The intense rivalry between Taraki and Amin within the Khalq faction heated up. In [[September]] [[1979]], Taraki's followers had made several attempts on Amin's life.

Taraki's death was first noted in the '''New Kabul Times''' on [[October 10]], which reported that the former leader only recently hailed as the "great teacher... great genius... great leader" had died quietly "of serious illness, which he had been suffering for some time."

==<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype"> وژل کېدل ==
Less than three months later, after the Amin government had been overthrown, the newly installed followers of Babrak Karmal gave another account of Taraki's death. 

According to this account, Amin ordered the commander of the palace guard to have Taraki executed. Taraki reportedly was suffocated with a pillow over his head. Amin's emergence from the power struggle within the small divided communist party in Afghanistan alarmed the Soviets and would usher in the series of events which lead to the Soviet invasion.
