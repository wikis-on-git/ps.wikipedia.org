Goethe was one of the key figures of [[German literature]] and the movement of [[Weimar Classicism]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; this movement coincides with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Sentimentality]] (''{{lang|de|Empfindsamkeit}}''), ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' and [[Romanticism]]. The author of the scientific text ''[[Theory of Colours]]'', he influenced [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] with his focus on plant [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].<ref name="darwin1">{{citebook|last=Darwin|first=C.

Goethe is the originator of the concept of ''Weltliteratur'' ("[[world literature]]"), having taken great interest in the literatures of [[English literature|England]], [[French literature|France]], [[Italian literature|Italy]], [[Ancient Greek literature|classical Greece]], [[Persian literature|Persia]], [[Arabic literature|the Arab world]], and others. His influence on [[German philosophy]] is virtually immeasurable, having major effect especially on the generation of [[Hegel]] and [[Schelling]], although Goethe himself expressly and decidedly refrained from practicing [[philosophy]] in the rarefied sense.

Goethe's influence spread across Europe, and for the next century his works were a major source of inspiration in [[European classical music|music]], [[drama]], [[poetry]] and [[philosophy]]. Goethe is considered by many to be the most important writer in the German language and one of the most important thinkers in [[Western culture]] as well. Early in his career, however, he wondered whether painting might not be his true vocation; late in his life, he expressed the expectation that he would ultimately be remembered above all for his work in [[Theory of Colours|colour]].

== Legal career ==
Goethe studied [[law]] in [[Leipzig]] from 1765 to 1768. Learning age-old judicial rules by heart was something he strongly detested. He preferred to attend the poetry lessons of [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Käthchen Schönkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the [[Rococo]] genre. In 1770, he anonymously released ''Annette'', his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]]. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy ''Die Mitschuldigen''. The restaurant [[Auerbachs Keller]] and its legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Faust's]] 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his [[closet drama]] ''[[Faust Part One]]''. Because his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.

In Frankfurt, Goethe became severely ill. During the next year and a half which followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. Bored in bed, he wrote an impudent crime comedy. In April 1770, his father lost his patience; Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies in [[Strasbourg]].

In [[Alsace]], Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who happened to be in town on the occasion of an eye operation. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, it was Herder who kindled his interest in Shakespeare, [[Ossian]] and in the notion of Volkspoesie (folk poetry). On October 14th 1772 he held a speech in his parental home in honour of the first German "Shakespeare Day". His first meeting with Shakespeare's works is described as his personally awakening in literature.<ref>[http://www.uni-duisburg-essen.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/goetheshak.htm Originally speech of Goethe to the ''Shakespeare's Day'' by University Duisburg</ref>

On a trip to the village Sesenheim, Goethe fell in love with Friederike Brion, but, after a couple of weeks, terminated the relationship. Several of his poems, like ''{{lang|de|Willkommen und Abschied}}'', ''{{lang|de|Sesenheimer Lieder}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Heideröslein}}'', originate from this time.

Despite being based on his own ideas, his legal [[thesis]] was published uncensored. Shortly after, he was offered a career in the [[French government]]. Goethe rejected it; he did not want to commit himself, but to instead remain an "original genius".

At the end of August 1771, Goethe was certified as a [[licensee]] in Frankfurt. He wanted to make the [[jurisdiction]] progressively more humane. In his first cases, he proceeded too vigorously, was reprimanded and lost the position. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the [[court]] of [[Darmstadt]], where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his [[brother-in-law]]) and [[Johann Heinrich Merck]]. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the [[biography]] of a [[Nobility|noble]] [[highwayman]] from the [[Peasants' War]]. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful [[drama]]. Entitled ''[[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen]]'', the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.

Goethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at [[Wetzlar]]. In 1774 Goethe wrote the book which would bring him world-wide fame, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. Despite the immense success of ''Werther'', it did not bring Goethe much financial gain{{ndash}} copyright law at the time being essentially nonexistent. (In later years Goethe would bypass this problem by periodically authorizing "new, revised" editions of his '''Complete Works'''.<ref>see ''Goethe and his Publishers''</ref>)

== Early years in Weimar ==
[[دوتنه:goethe.png|thumb|right|Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]
In 1775, Goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', to the court of [[Carl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]]. (The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's 26.) Goethe thus went to live in [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]], where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's chief adviser.

Goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. Goethe was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1782 (this being indicated by the "von" in his name).

During Goethe's term of office as a member of the Geheime Consilium, the top deliberative circle of the Duke Carl August of Saxony-Weimar, there are three cases of the killing of a newborn infant by its mother. Whereas in 1781, Dorothea Altwein was pardoned to lifelong penal servitude (she was released after 27 years), and Maria Rost assigned to lifelong penal servitude by the Duke, without judicial sentence (she was released after 6 years), Johanna Höhn was executed. Johanna Catharina Höhn, born the 15th of April 1759 in Tannroda in Saxony-Weimar, had killed her just-born baby, a boy, in an attack of panic. She was adjudicated on death, only by the sword, because there were arguments for mitigation. Duke Carl August would pardon Johanna Höhn to lifelong penal servitude. Therefore he commended the members of his government and the members of his deliberative circle to give their votes to the question, whether the capital punishment for this delict should be repealed. He himself was voting for repealing and to substitute by lifelong penal servitude. As one of the three members of the Geheime Consilium Goethe gave his vote for maintaining the capital punishment, at 4th of November 1783, after the votes of the others, Fritsch and Schnauss. Goethe' vote decided the issue: In Saxony-Weimar the capital punishment was not repealed, and the Duke ordered the execution, just after Goethe's vote. Johanna Höhn was beheaded at 28th of November 1783. Goethe gave his vote in the same year, in which he wrote his poem “Edel sei der Mensch, hilfreich und gut”.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

== Italy ==
[[دوتنه:Der junge Goethe, gemalt von Angelica Kauffmann 1787.JPG|thumb|right|Goethe, age 38, painted by [[Angelika Kauffmann]] 1787]]
Goethe's journey to the [[Italian peninsula]] from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his æsthetical and philosophical development. His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical art of ancient [[Art in ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Roman Art|Rome]]. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists [[Angelica Kauffmann]] and [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], as well as encountering such notable characters as [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton]] and [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] (see [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]).

He also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that "To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything." While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.

Goethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction ''[[Italian Journey]]''. ''Italian Journey'' only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in [[Venice]]. This "gap in the record" has been the source of much speculation over the years.

In the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816 ''Italian Journey'' inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in [[George Elliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]''.

== Weimar ==
In late 1792, Goethe took part in the [[battle of Valmy]] against [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]], assisting Duke [[Carl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Carl August]] of [[Saxe-Weimar]] during the failed invasion of France. Again during the [[Siege of Mainz]] he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his '''Complete Works'''.

In 1794 [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.

In 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress [[Christiane Vulpius]], the sister of [[Christian August Vulpius|Christian A. Vulpius]], and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, [[Napoleon]]'s army invaded the town. The French "spoon guards", the least-disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house. {{Quotation|[[دوتنه:Johann Wolfgang Goethe 1811.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Goethe. Painting by Luise Seidler (Weimar 1811)]]
The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown&nbsp;… he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him&nbsp;… . His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work. Goethe noted in his diary: "Fires, rapine, a frightful night&nbsp;… Preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck." The luck was Goethe's, the steadfastness was displayed by Christiane.|''[[Schopenhauer]] and the Wild Years of Philosophy'', Ch. 5<ref>{{citebook|last=Safranski|first=Rüdiger|title=Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1990|isbn=0674792750}}</ref>}}

[[دوتنه:Ulrike von Levetzow.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Ulrike von Levetzow]]. This 18 year old girl inspired Goethe to the famous ''[[Marienbad Elegy]]'']]
The next day, Goethe legitimized their relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the court chapel. The marriage of Goethe and Christiane Vulpius produced one son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (25 December 1789 {{ndash}} 28 October 1830), whose wife, Ottilie von Pogwisch (31 October 1796 {{ndash}} 26 October 1872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832. The younger couple had three children: Walther, Freiherr von Goethe (9 April 1818 {{ndash}} 15 April 1885), Wolfgang, Freiherr von Goethe (18 September 1820 {{ndash}} 20 January 1883) and Alma von Goethe (29 October 1827 {{ndash}} 29 September 1844). 

Christiane Vulpius died in 1816.

== Later life ==
Post-1793, Goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature. By 1820, Goethe was on amiable terms with [[Kaspar Maria von Sternberg]]. 
In 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, Goethe fell in love with [[Ulrike von Levetzow]] whom he wanted to marry, but, because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed. Their last meeting in [[Carlsbad]] on 5 September 1823 inspired him to the famous ''[[Marienbad Elegy]]'' which he considered one of his finest and dearest works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamelika.cz/SHAMELIKA/1974/1974_16/h74_16.htm|title=Goethe's third summer}}</ref>

In 1832, after a life of vast productivity, Goethe died in [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]]. He is buried in the Ducal Vault at Weimar's Historical Cemetery.

[[Johann Peter Eckermann|Eckermann]] closes his famous work, ''[[Conversations with Goethe]]'', with this passage:

{{Quotation|The morning after Goethe's death, a deep desire seized me to look once again upon his earthly garment. His faithful servant, Frederick, opened for me the chamber in which he was laid out. Stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance. The mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts. I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode. I laid my hand on his heart - there was a deep silence - and I turned away to give free vent to my suppressed tears.|(p. 426, Da Capo Press edition, [[John Oxenford]] translation)}}

The first production of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'' took place in [[Weimar]] in 1850.  The conductor was [[Franz Liszt]], who chose the date 28 August in honour of Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954</ref>

=== Literary work ===
The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were his tragedy ''[[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen]]'' (1773), which was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (called ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'' in German) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' period which marked the early phase of [[Romanticism]] - indeed the book is often considered to be the "spark" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first "best-seller". (For the entirety of his life this was the work with which the vast majority of Goethe's contemporaries associated him). During the years at Weimar before he met [[Schiller]] he began ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', wrote the dramas [[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|''Iphigenie auf Tauris'']] (''Iphigenia in Tauris''), [[Egmont (play)|''Egmont'']], [[Torquato Tasso (play)|''Torquato Tasso'']], and the fable ''Reineke Fuchs''.

To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong [[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]] (the continuation of ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''), the [[idyll]] of ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', and the ''[[Roman Elegies]]''. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared ''[[Faust Part One]]'', ''[[Elective Affinities]]'', the [[West-östlicher Diwan|''West-Eastern Divan'']] (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of [[Hafez]]), his autobiographical ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' (''From My Life: Poetry and Truth'') which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', and a series of treatises on art. His writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.
[[دوتنه:Hafiz Goethe.JPG|thumb|Hāfez-Goethe memorial in Weimar.]]

''[[Faust Part Two]]'' was only finished in the year of his death, and was published posthumously.

=== Scientific work ===
{{Quotation|As to what I have done as a poet,… I take no pride in it… But that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours - of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.|[[Johann Eckermann]], ''Conversations with Goethe''}}

Although his literary work has attracted the greatest amount of interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natureinstitute.org/about/who/goethe.htm |publisher=The Nature Institute|title=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe |accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> He wrote several works on plant [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and colour theory.

With his focus on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] he influenced [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].<ref name="Opitz" /><ref name="darwin1"/> His studies led him to independently discover the human [[Globular process|intermaxillary bone]] in 1784, which [[Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet|Broussonet]] (1779) and [[Félix Vicq-d'Azyr|Vicq d'Azyr]] (1780) had (using different methods) identified several years earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=K. Barteczko and M. Jacob |title=A re-evaluation of the premaxillary bone in humans |journal=Anatomy and Embryology |year=1999 |volume=207 |issue=6 |pages=417–437 |doi=10.1007/s00429-003-0366-x }}</ref> While not the only one in his time to question the prevailing view that this bone did not exist in humans, Goethe, who believed ancient anatomists had known about this bone, was the first to prove its peculiarity to all mammals. In 1790, he published his ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Fjuaog1_E0C&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&ots=ezKJugQmvs&dq=intermaxillary+bone+prove&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&sig=jkPjZ1STzEfso5aFHxmFqxeof18|title=[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>
[[دوتنه:Goethe-LightSpectrum.svg|thumb|200px|left|Light spectrum, from ''Theory of Colours'' – Goethe observed that with a prism, colour arises at light-dark edges, and the spectrum occurs where these coloured edges overlap]]

During his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the ''leaf'' - he writes, "from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other".<ref>{{cite book |last=Goethe |first=J.W. |title=Italian Journey |publisher=Suhrkamp ed., vol 6 | translator = Robert R Heitner}}</ref>

In 1810, Goethe published his [[Theory of Colours]], which he considered his most important work. In it, he (contentiously) characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light. After being translated into English by [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] in 1840, this theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably [[J. M. W. Turner]] (Bockemuhl, 1991<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockemuhl |first=M. |title=Turner |publisher=Taschen, Koln |year=1991|isbn=3822863254}}</ref>). It also inspired the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], to write his ''Remarks on Colour''. Goethe was vehemently opposed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive description of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although Goethe cannot necessarily be criticized for the accuracy and extent of his observations, scientists in general have found little use for his theory because not much can be predicted by means of it. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, 'for the colours diametrically opposed to each other… are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. (Goethe, ''Theory of Colours'', 1810<ref>{{cite book |last=Goethe |first=Johann |title=Theory of Colours, paragraph #50 |year=1810}}</ref>). In this, he anticipated [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process|opponent color theory]] (1872).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html |title=Goethe's Color Theory|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

Goethe outlines his method in the essay, ''The experiment as mediator between subject and object'' (1772). In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, [[Rudolf Steiner]], presents Goethe's approach to science as [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenological]]. Steiner elaborated on this in the books ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_index.html |title=The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> and ''Goethe's World View'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA006/English/MP1985/GA006_index.html |title=Goethe's World View|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> in which he emphasizes the need of the perceiving organ of intuition in order to grasp Goethe's biological archetype (i.e. ''The Typus'').

The short [[epistolary novel]], ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'', or ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. Goethe admitted that he "shot his hero to save himself": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary [[archetype]]. The fact that ''Werther'' ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral{{ndash}} a funeral which "no clergyman attended"{{ndash}} made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide was considered sinful by [[Christian doctrine]]: suicides were denied [[Christian burial]] with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|publisher=Pips Project|title=The Stigma of Suicide - A history}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://elsinore.ucsc.edu/burial/burialSuicide.html|title=Ophelia's Burial}}</ref> Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.

The next work, his epic [[closet drama]] [[Goethe's Faust|''Faust'']], was to be completed in stages, and only published in its entirety after his death. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. The first operatic version, by [[Spohr]], appeared in 1814, and was subsequently the inspiration for operas and oratorios by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Gounod]], [[Boito]], [[Busoni]], and [[Schnittke]] as well as symphonic works by [[Liszt]], [[Wagner]], and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. Faust became the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ur-/ ur-myth] of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the [[Goetheanum]] staged the world [[premiere]] of a complete production of Faust. On occasion, the play is still staged in Germany and other parts around the world.

[[دوتنه:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein 007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Goethe in the Roman Campagna'' (1786) by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]]. Oil on canvas, 164 x 206&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.staedelmuseum.de/index.php?id=442|publisher=[[Städel]]|accessdate=2008-08-28|title=Goethe in the Roman Campagna}}</ref>]]
Goethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed ''Innerlichkeit'' ("introversion") and represented by, for example, [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]. Goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Hugo Wolf|Wolf]]. Perhaps the single most influential piece is "Mignon's Song" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: "''{{lang|de|Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn}}''?" ("Do you know the land where the lemons bloom?").

He is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as "Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him", "Divide and rule, a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one", and "Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from ''Faust'', such as "{{lang|de|Das also war des Pudels Kern}}", "{{lang|de|Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss}}", or "{{lang|de|Grau ist alle Theorie}}" have entered everyday German usage.

It may be taken as another measure of Goethe's fame that other well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to him, such as [[Hippocrates]]' "Art is long, life is short", which is found in Goethe's ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''.

=== Eroticism ===
Many of Goethe's works, especially [[Goethe's Faust|''Faust'']], the ''[[Roman Elegies]]'', and the ''Venetian Epigrams'', depict hetero- and homosexual erotic passions and acts. In Faust, having signed (the Devil insists on his signature in an actual contract) his deal with the devil, the very first use of his new power thus gained sees Faust raping a young teenage girl. In fact, some of the ''Venetian Epigrams'' were held back from publication due to their sexual content. However, Karl Hugo Pruys caused national controversy in Germany when his 1999 book ''The Tiger's Tender Touch: The Erotic Life of Goethe'' tentatively deduced from Goethe's writings the possibility of Goethe's [[homosexuality]].<ref>Karl Hugo Pruys, ''The Tiger's Tender Touch: The Erotic Life of Goethe''. Trans. Kathleen Bunten. (Edition Q, 1999). ISBN 1-883695-12-0.</ref> The sexual portraitures and allusions in his work may stem from one of the many effects of Goethe's eye-opening sojourn in Italy, where men, who shunned the prevalence of women's [[venereal disease]]s and unconscionable conditions{{Vague|date=November 2008}}, embraced homosexuality as a solution that was not widely imitated outside of Italy.<ref>''Outing Goethe and His Age'', edited by Alice A. Kuzniar (Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1996) (page number needed). ISBN 0-8047-2615-9.</ref> Whatever the case, Goethe clearly saw [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in general as a topic that merited poetic and artistic depiction. This went against the thought of his time, when the very private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative, and makes him appear more modern than he is typically thought to be.<ref>''Outing Goethe and His Age''; edited by Alice A. Kuzniar (page number needed)</ref>

=== Religion ===
Born into a Protestant (Lutheran) family, Goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the 1755 [[Lisbon earthquake]] and the [[Seven Years' War]]. His later spiritual perspective evolved among [[pantheism]], [[humanism]], and various elements of Western [[esotericism]], as seen most vividly in Part II of ''Faust''.

A year before his death he expressed an identification with the [[Hypsistarians]], an ancient Jewish-pagan sect of the [[Black Sea]] region. After describing his difficulties with mainstream religion, [[Goethe]] laments:
{{quotation|…I have found no confession of faith to which I could ally myself without reservation. Now in my old age, however, I have learned of a sect, the Hypsistarians, who, hemmed in between heathens, Jews and Christians, declared that they would treasure, admire, and honour the best, the most perfect that might come to their knowledge, and inasmuch as it must have a close connection to the Godhead, pay it reverence. A joyous light thus beamed at me suddenly out of a dark age, for I had the feeling that all my life I had been aspiring to qualify as a Hypsistarian. That, however, is no small task, for how does one, in the limitations of one's individuality, come to know what is most excellent?|from a letter to Sulpiz Boisserée dated 22 March 1831<ref>quoted in Peter Boerner, ''Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 1832/1982: A Biographical Essay''. Bonn: Inter Nationes, 1981 p. 82]</ref>}}

:"Science and art belong to the whole world, and before them vanish the barriers of nationality."  (Goethe) 

Goethe had a great effect on the nineteenth century. In many respects, he was the originator of many ideas which later became widespread. He produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism, a theory of [[optics|colours]] and early work on [[evolution]] and [[linguistics]]. He was fascinated by [[mineralogy]], and the mineral [[goethite]] is named after him. His non-fiction writings, most of which are philosophic and aphoristic in nature, spurred the development of many philosophers, including [[G.W.F. Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Carl Gustav Jung|Carl Jung]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Along with [[Schiller]], he was one of the leading figures of [[Weimar Classicism]].

Goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and epigrammatic, and epic. He would argue that [[classicism]] was the means of controlling art, and that [[romanticism]] was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. Even in contemporary culture, he stands in the background as the author of the story upon which Disney's [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]] is based.

His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. Beethoven declared that a "Faust" Symphony would be the greatest thing for Art. Liszt and Mahler both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this seminal work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: [[Doctor Faustus]]. [[دوتنه:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|Second Goetheanum]] The Faust tragedy/drama, often called "{{lang|de|'''Das''' [[Drama]] der Deutschen}}" ('''the''' drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation. Followers of the twentieth century esotericist [[Rudolf Steiner]] built a theatre named the [[Goetheanum]] after him - where festival performances of [[Faust]] are still performed.

Goethe was also a cultural force, and by researching folk traditions, he created many of the norms for celebrating [[Christmas]], and argued that the organic nature of the land moulded the people and their customs—an argument that has recurred ever since, including recently in the work of [[Jared Diamond]]. He argued that laws could not be created by pure rationalism, since geography and history shaped habits and patterns. This stood in sharp contrast to the prevailing [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that reason was sufficient to create well-ordered societies and good laws.

It was to a considerable degree due to Goethe's reputation that the city of [[Weimar]] was chosen in 1919 as the venue for the [[Weimar National Assembly|national assembly]], convened to draft [[Weimar constitution|a new constitution]] for what would become known as Germany's [[Weimar Republic]]. 

The Federal Republic of Germany’s cultural institution, [[Goethe-Institut|The Goethe-Institut]] is named after him, and promotes the study of German abroad and fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on its culture, society and politics.

=== Influence ===
Goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional. This is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: "There is nothing worse than imagination without taste". He argued in his scientific works that a "formative impulse", which he said is operative in every organism, causes an organism to form itself according to its own distinct laws, and therefore rational laws or fiats could not be imposed at all from a higher, transcendent sphere; this placed him in direct opposition to those who attempted to form "enlightened" monarchies based on "rational" laws by, for example, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of Austria or, the subsequent Emperor of the French, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]]. A quotation from his ''Scientific Studies'' will suffice:

{{Quotation|We conceive of the individual animal as a small world, existing for its own sake, by its own means. Every creature is its own reason to be. All its parts have a direct effect on one another, a relationship to one another, thereby constantly renewing the circle of life; thus we are justified in considering every animal physiologically perfect. Viewed from within, no part of the animal is a useless or arbitrary product of the formative impulse (as so often thought). Externally, some parts may seem useless because the inner coherence of the animal nature has given them this form without regard to outer circumstance. Thus…[not] the question, What are they for? but rather, Where do they come from?|Suhrkamp ed., vol 12, p. 121; trans. Douglas Miller|Scientific Studies}}

This change later became the basis for 19th century thought; organic rather than geometrical, evolving rather than created, and based on sensibility and intuition, rather than on imposed order, culminating in, as he said, a "living quality" wherein the subject and object are dissolved together in a poise of inquiry. Consequently, he embraced neither [[teleological]] nor [[deterministic]] views of growth within every organism. Instead, the world as a whole grows through continual, external, and internal strife. Moreover, he did not embrace the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] views that contemporaneous science subsumed during his time, and there with he denied rationality's superiority as the sole interpretation of reality. Furthermore, he declared that all knowledge is related to humanity through its functional value alone and that knowledge presupposes a [[Perspectivism|perspectival]] quality. He also stated that the fundamental nature of the world is [[aesthetic]].

His views make him, along with [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classicistic]] period of architecture; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems. Thinkers such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s. His ideas on evolution would frame the question which [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] would approach within the scientific paradigm.
