'''Business''' refers to at least three closely related commercial topics.  The first is a commercial, professional or industrial organization or enterprise, generally referred to as "a business."  The second is commercial, professional, and industrial activity generally, as in "business continues to evolve as markets change."  Finally, business can be used to refer to a particular area of economic activity, such as the "record business" or the "computer business" (see [[Industry]]).  This article is concerned primarily with the first definition of individual businesses, but also contains links to general business and [[management]] topics, in the sense of the second definition.

Individual businesses are established in order to perform [[economic]] activities.  With some exceptions (such as [[cooperative]]s, [[non-profit organization]]s and generally, institutions of [[government]]), businesses exist to produce [[profit]]. In other words, the owners and operators of a business have as one of their main objectives the receipt or generation of a [[financial return]] in exchange for expending [[time]], [[effort]] and [[capital]].

There are many types of businesses, and, as a result, businesses can be classified in many ways.  One of the most common focuses on the primary profit-generating activities of a business, for example:


* [[Manufacturer]]s produce [[product (business)|products]], from raw materials or component parts, which they then sell at a profit.  Companies that make physical goods, such as cars or pipes, are considered manufacturers.
* [[service|Service businesses]] offer intangible goods or services and typically generate a profit by charging for labor or other services provided to other businesses or [[consumers]].  Organizations ranging from house painters to consulting firms to restaurants are types of service businesses.
* [[Retail]]ers and [[distribution (business)|Distributors]] act as middle-men in getting goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumer, generating a profit as a result of providing sales or distribution services.  Most consumer-oriented stores and catalogue companies are distributors or retailers.
* [[Agriculture]] and [[mining]] businesses are concerned with the production of raw material, such as plants or minerals.
* [[Financial]] businesses include banks and other companies that generate profit through investment and management of [[capital]].
* Information businesses generate profits primarily from the resale of intellectual property and include movie studios, publishers and packaged software companies.
* [[Utilities]] produce public services, such as heat, electricity, or sewage treatment, and are usually government chartered.
* [[Real estate]] businesses generate profit from the selling, renting, and development of properties, homes, and buildings.
* [[transport|Transportation]] businesses deliver goods and individuals from location to location, generating a profit on the transportation costs.

There are many other divisions and subdivisions of businesses.  The authoritative list of business types for North America (although it is widely used around the world) is generally considered to be the NAICS, or [[North American Industry Classification System]]. The equivalent European Union list is the [http://www.fifoost.org/database/nace/nace-en_2002AB.php NACE].
