'''Lithuania''', officially the '''Republic of Lithuania''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: ''Lietuva''; official — ''Lietuvos Respublika''), is a country in northern Europe. The largest of the three [[Baltic States]] situated along the [[Baltic Sea]], it shares borders with [[لاتويا]] to the north, [[Belarus]] to the southeast, [[Poland]] to the south, and the [[Russia]]n exclave of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] to the southwest. Lithuania has been a member state of the [[European Union]] since [[May 1]] [[2004]].

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Lithuania}}

Lithuania entered into the annals of European history when it was first mentioned in a medieval German manuscript, the ''[[Quedlinburg]] Chronicle'', on February 14, 1009. The Lithuanian lands were united by [[Mindaugas]] in 1235, and neighboring countries referred to it as "the state of Lithuania". The official coronation of Mindaugas as [[King of Lithuania]], on July 6, 1253, marked its recognition by [[Christendom]], and the official recognition of Lithuanian statehood as the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] <ref> {{lt icon}} Tomas Baranauskas. [http://www.voruta.lt/article.php?article=118&showtype=archive ''Lietuvos karalystei – 750 (750 years for Kingdom of Lithuania)''].2001 </ref>. 

During the early period of the [[Gediminids]] (1316-1430), the state occupied the territories of present-day [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of [[Poland]] and [[Russia]] <ref> {{en icon}}Paul Magocsi. ''History of the Ukraine''. University of Toronto Press, 1996. p.128 </ref>. By the end of the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest country in [[Europe]] <ref> {{en icon}}Robert Bideleux. A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change. Routledge, 1998. p.122</ref> . The Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched across a substantial part of Europe, from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]]. Lithuanian nobility, city dwellers and peasants accepted Christianity in 1385, following Poland's offer of its crown to [[Jogaila]], the Grand Duke of Lithuania. [[Grand Duke]] [[Jogaila]] was crowned King of Poland on February 2, 1386. Lithuania and [[Poland]] were joined into a [[personal union]], as both countries were ruled by the same [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. 

In 1401, the formal union was dissolved as a result of disputes over legal terminology, and [[Vytautas]], the cousin of [[Jogaila]], became the Grand Duke of Lithuania. A royal crown had been bestowed upon [[Vytautas]] in 1429 by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund, the Holy Roman Emperor]], but Polish magnates prevented the coronation of Vytautas by seizing the crown as it was being brought to him. A new crown was ordered in Germany and a new date set for the coronation, but a month later Vytautas died.
 
In 1569, Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state called the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. As a member of the Commonwealth, Lithuania retained its sovereignity and its institutions, including a separate army and currency <ref> {{en icon}} Stone, Daniel. ''The Polish-Lithuanian state: 1386-1795''. University of Washington Press , 2001. p. 63</ref>. In 1795, the joint state was dissolved by the third [[Partition of Poland|Partition of the Commonwealth]], which forfeited its lands to [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]], under duress. Over ninety percent of Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire and the remainder into [[Prussia]]. 

On February 16, [[1918]], Lithuania re-established its independence. From July, [[1918]], until November of that year, [[Monaco]]-born [[King]] [[Mindaugas II]] was pronounced the titular [[monarch]] of Lithuania, until the country's [[parliament]] opted for a [[republic|republican]] form of government. From the outset, territorial disputes with Poland (over the [[Vilnius region]] and the [[Suvalkai region]]) and with [[Germany]] (over the [[Klaipėda region]], German: Memelland) preoccupied the foreign policy of the new nation. During the interwar period, the constitutional capitol was [[Vilnius]], although the city itself was annexed by Poland from 1920 to 1939 (see [[History of Vilnius]] for more details). The Lithuanian government at the time was relocated to [[Kaunas]], which officially held the status of [[temporary capital of Lithuania|temporary capital]].  

In [[1940]], at the beginning of [[World War II]], the Soviet Union [[occupation|occupied]] and [[annexation|annexed]] Lithuania in accordance with the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. It later came under German occupation, during which around 190,000 or 91% of the [[Lithuanian Jews]] were killed, resulting in one of the worst [[death rate]]s of the [[Holocaust]]. After the retreat of the [[Wermacht|German army]], Lithuania was re-occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1944. 

During the Soviet and [[Nazi]] occupations between 1940 and 1954, Lithuania lost over 780,000 residents. An estimated 120,000 to 300,000 of that number were killed or [[exile]]d to [[Siberia]] by the [[Soviets]], while others chose to emigrate to western countries.
  
[[Image:LithuaniaHistory.png|left|thumb|200px|Map showing changes in the territory of Lithuania from the 13th century to the present day]]

Fifty years of communist rule ended with the advent of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] in the late 1980s. Lithuania, led by [[Sąjūdis]], an anti-communist and anti-Soviet [[independence movement]], proclaimed its renewed independence on March 11, 1990. Lithuania was the first Soviet republic to do so, though Soviet forces unsuccessfully tried to suppress this secession. The Soviets attacked the [[Vilnius TV Tower]] on the night of January 13, 1991, an act that resulted in the death of 13 Lithuanian civilians <ref>{{En icon}}''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4059000/4059959.stm BBC Story]''</ref>. The last Russian troops left Lithuania on August 31, 1993 — even earlier than they departed [[East Germany]]. 

On February 4, 1991, [[Iceland]] became the first country to recognize Lithuanian independence. [[Sweden]] was the first to open an embassy in the country. The [[United States of America]] never recognized the Soviet claim to Lithuania or to the other two Baltic republics.

Lithuania joined the [[United Nations]] on September 17, 1991. On May 31, 2001, Lithuania became the 141st member of the [[World Trade Organization]]. Since 1988, Lithuania has sought closer ties with the West, and so on January 4, 1994, it became the first of the [[Baltic States]] to apply for [[NATO]] membership. On March 29, 2004, it became a full and equal NATO member and on May 1, 2004, Lithuania joined the [[European Union]].

Since Lithuania declared independence on March 11, 1990, it has kept strong democratic traditions. In the first general elections after the independence on October 25, 1992, 56.75% of the total number of voters supported the [[Constitution of Lithuania|new constitution]]<ref> {{lt icon}}[http://www3.lrs.lt/docs2/QKVXRGNF.DOC Nuo 1991 m. iki šiol paskelbtų referendumų rezultatai (Results from Refrenda 1991-Present)], Microsoft Word Document, [[Seimas]]. Accessed June 4, 2006.</ref>. Drafting the constitution was a long and complicated process. The role of the President fueled the most heated debates. Drawing from the interwar experiences, politicians made many different proposals ranging from strong [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] to the [[United States|United States']] model. Eventually a compromise [[semi-presidential system]] was agreed upon.<ref>Lina Kulikauskienė, Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucija (Constitution of Lithuania), Native History, CD, 2002. ISBN 9986-9216-7-8</ref>. 

The Lithuanian [[head of state]] is the [[List of Presidents of Lithuania|President]], elected directly for a five-year term; he or she may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The post of President is largely ceremonial with functions of overseeing foreign affairs and national security policy. The President is also the commander-in-chief. The President, with the approval of the parliamentary body, the [[Seimas]], also appoints the [[prime minister]] and on the latter's nomination, appoints the rest of the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], as well as a number of other top civil servants and the judges for all courts. The judges of the [[Constitution]]al Court (''Konstitucinis Teismas''), who serve for nine year terms, are appointed by the President (three judges), the Chairman of the Seimas (three judges) and the chairman of the Supreme Court (three judges).

The [[unicameral]] Lithuanian [[parliament]], the ''[[Seimas]]'', has 141 members who are elected to four-year terms. 71 of the members of this [[legislative]] body are elected in single constituencies, and the other 70 are elected in a nationwide vote by [[proportional representation]]. A party must receive at least 5% of the national vote to be represented in the Seimas.

== Administration ==
{{Main article|Subdivisions of Lithuania}}

[[Image:Municipalities in Lithuania.png|right|thumb|350px|Lithuania is subdivided into 10 counties and 60 municipalities]]
The current administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union. Lithuania now has a three-part administrative division: Lithuania is divided into [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]] (Lithuanian: singular — ''apskritis'', plural — ''apskritys'') that are further subdivided into [[List of municipalities of Lithuania|60 municipalities]] (Lithuanian: singular — ''savivaldybė'', plural — ''savivaldybės'') which consist of over 500 [[elderate]]s (Lithuanian: singular — ''seniūnija'', plural — ''seniūnijos'').  

The counties are ruled by [[county governor]]s (Lithuanian: ''apskrities viršininkas'') who are appointed by the central government. These officials ensure that the municipalities adhere to the laws of Lithuania and the constitution. County government oversees local governments and their implementation of the national laws, programs, and policies<ref name=county>{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=270541 Lietuvos Respublikos apskrities valdymo įstatymas (Republic of Lithuania Law on County Governing)], [[Seimas]] law database, December 15, 1994, Law no. I-707. Accessed June 3, 2006.</ref>. 

Municipalities are the most important unit. Some municipalities are historically called "district municipalities", and thus are often shortened to "district"; others are called "city municipalities", sometimes shortened to "city." Each municipality has its own elected government. In the past, the election of municipality councils occurred once every three years, but it now takes place every four years. The council elects the [[mayor]] of the municipality and other required personnel. The municipality councils also appoint [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] to govern the elderates. There is currently a proposal for [[direct election]] of mayors and elders, however that would require an amendment to the constitution<ref>{{lt icon}} Justinas Vanagas, [http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/article.php?id=7418983 Seimo prioritetai šią sesiją – tiesioginiai mero rinkimai, gyventojų nuosavybė ir euras (Seimas Priorities this session: direct election of mayors, property of residents, and euro)], Delfi.lt, September 5, 2005. Accessed June 3, 2006.</ref>.

Elderates are the smallest units and they do not play a role in national politics. They were created so that people could receive necessary services close to their homes; for example, in rural areas the elderates register births and deaths. They are most active in the social sector: they identify needy individuals or families and distribute welfare or organize other forms of relief<ref name=elderates>{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter2/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=146527 Lietuvos Respublikos vietos savivaldos įstatymo pakeitimo įstatymas (Republic of Lithuania Law on Amending the Law on Local Self-Governing)], [[Seimas]] law database, October 12, 2000, Law no. VIII-2018. Accessed June 3, 2006.</ref>.

The current system of administrative division receives frequent criticism for being too bureaucratic and ineffective. Significant complaints are made about the number of counties, since they do not have much power vested in them. One proposal is to create four lands, a new administrative unit, the boundaries of which would be determined by the [[Regions of Lithuania|ethnographic regions of Lithuania]]. The benefit would be that the lands would follow natural boundaries, rather than being defined by bureaucrats or politicians<ref>{{lt icon}} Dr. Žilvytis Bernardas Šaknys [http://www3.vrk.lt/pls/inter/dba_intra.W3_VIEWER.ViewDoc?p_int_tekst_id=21329&p_int_tv_id=2231&p_org=0 Lietuvos Respublikos administracinio teritorinio suskirstymo perspektyvos: etnografiniai kultūriniai regionai (Perspectives of Republic of Lithuania Administrative Subdivision: Ethnographic — Cultural Regions)], The Council for the Protection of Ethnic Culture, [[Seimas]], December 12, 2002. Accessed June 4, 2006.</ref>. Another of the proposed solutions involves reducing the number of counties so that there would be five in total, each based in one of the five largest cities with populations of over 100,000<ref>{{lt icon}} Dr. Antanas Tyla, [http://www3.vrk.lt/pls/inter/dba_intra.W3_VIEWER.ViewDoc?p_int_tekst_id=21323&p_int_tv_id=2231&p_org=0 Pastabos dėl Apskričių valdymo reformos koncepcijos (Notes on Conception of County Governing Reform)], The Council for the Protection of Ethnic Culture, [[Seimas]], May 16, 2001. Accessed June 4, 2006.</ref>. Others complain that elderates have no real power and receive too little attention; they could potentially become local initiative communities which could tackle many rural problems<ref>{{lt icon}} Indrė Makaraitytė, [http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/atgimimas/article.php?id=5663231 Europos Sąjungos pinigai kaimo neišgelbės (Money from the European Union Will Not Save the Rural Areas)], Atgimimas, Delfi.lt, December 16, 2004.

[[Image:Kretinga rural tourism.jpg|thumb|200px|A cottage at a hotel in a rural area is a sign of increasingly popular rural tourism]]
Lithuania is situated in northern [[Europe]] and is the largest and most populous of the [[Baltic states]]. It has around 99 [[kilometre]]s (61.5 [[mile|mi]]) of sandy coastline, of which only about 38 kilometres (24 mi) face the open [[Baltic Sea]]; the rest of the coast is sheltered by the [[Curonian Spit|Curonian sand peninsula]]. Lithuania's major [[Ice-free port|warm-water port]], [[Klaipėda]], lies at the narrow mouth of the [[Curonian Lagoon]] (Lithuanian: ''Kuršių marios''), a shallow lagoon extending south to [[Kaliningrad]]. The main river, the [[Neman River]], and some of its tributaries carry international shipping vessels. 

The Lithuanian landscape has been smoothed by glaciers. The highest areas are the [[moraine|moraines]] in the western uplands and eastern highlands, none of which are taller than 300 metres (1,000 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level, with the maximum elevation being [[Juozapinė Hill]] at 292 metres (958 ft). The terrain features numerous lakes, [[Lake Vištytis]] for example, and wetlands; a mixed forest zone covers 30% of the country. The [[climate]] lies between maritime and continental, with wet, moderate winters and summers. According to some geographers, Lithuania's capitol, [[Vilnius]], lies a few kilometres south of the [[geographical centre of Europe]].

Lithuania consists of the following [[Regions of Lithuania|historical and cultural regions]]:
*[[Aukštaitija]] — literally, the "Highlands"
*[[Samogitia]] (Lithuanian: ''Žemaitija'') — literally, the "Lowlands"
*[[Dzūkija]] (Lithuanian: ''Dzūkija'' or ''Dainava'')
*[[Sudovia]] (Lithuanian: ''Sūduva'' or ''Suvalkija'')
*[[Lithuania Minor]] also known as "Prussian Lithuania" — (Lithuanian: ''Mažoji Lietuva'' or ''Prūsų Lietuva''). Most of it is currently controlled by [[Russia]] ([[Kaliningrad Oblast]]).

== Economy ==
{{Main article|Economy of Lithuania}}
[[Image:Vilnius skyline at night.Lithuania.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Vilnius]] Financial Center is a symbol of rapid economic growth of Lithuania]]

In 2003, prior to joining the European Union, Lithuania had the highest economic growth rate amongst all candidate and member countries, reaching 8.8% in the third quarter. In 2004 -7%; 2005 - 7.5%; 2006 second quarter - 7.7%  growth in GDP reflected impressive economic development <ref> {{en icon}} Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. ''[http://www.std.lt/en/pages/view/?id=1665  Change of GDP, 2002-2006]''</ref> . Most of the trade Lithuania conducts is within the [[European Union]].

It is a  member of the [[World Trade Organization]], and the [[European Union]]. By UN classification, Lithuania is a country with a high average income. The country boasts a well developed modern infrastructure of railways, airports and four lane highways. It has almost full employment, with an unemployment rate of only 2.9%. According to officially published figures, EU membership fueled a booming economy, increased outsourcing into the country, and boosted the tourism sector. The [[Lithuanian litas|litas]], the national currency, has been pegged to the [[Euro]] since February 2, 2002 at the rate of EUR 1.00 = LTL 3.4528 <ref> {{en icon}} ''[http://www.lb.lt/home/default.asp Lietuvos Bankas]''</ref>, and Lithuania is expected to switch to the Euro on [[1 January]] [[2009]].
[[Image:Klaipeda port.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Klaipėda]] port is the only port in Lithuania and is vital to its economy]]
Like other countries in the region ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]]) Lithuania also has a [[Flat tax|flat tax rate ]] rather than a [[Graduated tax|progressive scheme]]. Lithuanian income levels still lag behind the rest of the older EU members, with per capita GDP in 2006 at 56% of the EU average. Lower wages may have been a factor that in 2004 influenced the trend of emigration to wealthiest EU countries, something that has been made legally possible as a result of [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]]. In 2006 income tax was reduced to 27% and a further reduction to 24% is expected in 2008. Income tax reduction and 12% annual wage growth is starting to make an impact with some emigrees gradually beginning to come back.<ref>[http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/article.php?id=10004761 Lithuanian News]</ref> The latest official data show emigration in early 2006 to be 30% lower than the previous year, with 3,483 people leaving in four months.

== Demographics ==
{{Main article|Demographics of Lithuania}}
[[Image:GreatCourtyard.jpg|thumb|200px|The great yard of [[Vilnius University]], one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe. About 70% of Lithuanian high school graduates continue their studies in universities and colleges.]][[Image:Lithuania Paluse church.jpg|thumb|200px|The oldest wooden church is located in [[Palūšė]]. Lithuania has strong Catholic traditions.]]

===Ethnic diversity===
83.5% of the Lithuanian population are ethnic Lithuanians who speak the [[Lithuanian language]] (one of the two surviving members of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic language group]]), which is the official language of the state. Several sizable minorities exist, such as [[Poles]] (6.7%), [[Russians]] (6.3%), and [[Belarusians]] (1.2%) <ref>{{en icon}} Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. ''[http://www.std.lt/en/pages/view/?id=1731  Population by ethnicity, census]''. Updated in 2005 </ref>  . 

Poles are the largest minority, concentrated in southeast Lithuania (the [[Vilnius region]]). Russians are the second largest minority, concentrated mostly in two cities; they constitute sizeable minorities in [[Vilnius]] (13%) and [[Klaipėda]] (20%) and a slim majority in the town of [[Visaginas]] (55%)

Because of Soviet occupation, most Lithuanians are bilingual in Russian. According to the Eurostat poll about 80% of the Lithuanians can hold a conversation in Russian and almost all are familiar with the most general phrases and expressions.  Nowadays, most Lithuanian schools teach English as a first foreign language, but students may also study German, or, in some schools, French.  Schools where Russian and Polish are the primary languages of education exist in the areas populated by these minorities.

===Religion===
The historically predominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has been the majority confession since the [[Christianize|Christianization]] of Lithuania in the [[14th century]]. No less than 79% <ref> {{en icon}} Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. ''[http://www.std.lt/en/pages/view/?id=1734  Population by Religious Confession, census]''. Updated in 2005 </ref> of Lithuanians are Roman Catholic. The [[Roman Catholic]] Church used to be an influential factor in the country, and some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime and, after independence was regained, against socialism and [[liberalism]], especially in ethical questions.

The nationally renowned anti-communist resistance [[shrine]], the [[Hill of Crosses]], upon which thousands of [[Latin rite]] [[crucifix|crosses]] of all sizes have been placed, is located near the city of [[Šiauliai]]. During the late [[1800s]], the erecting of Latin crosses upon the mentioned hill was forbidden by the Czarist [[Russian Orthodox]] authorities. During the [[20th century]], the [[Soviet]] authorities also forbade such explicit religious symbols. The crosses were removed in [[1961]], with tractors and bulldozers, but despite Soviet prohibitions, Lithuanian Roman Catholics continued to put small crucifixes and larger crosses on this ''Hill of the Crosses''. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the hill during his visit to Lithuania, primarily because it was a sign of anti-Communist Catholic resistance, as well as a Roman Catholic religious site. Lithuania was the only majority-Catholic former Soviet republic.

The diverse Protestant community (1.9 % of the total population) is much smaller than the Roman Catholic Church; Protestants are scattered all over the northern and western parts of Lithuania. Lithuania was historically positioned in between the two German-controlled states of [[Livonia]] to the north and the Protestant [[East Prussia|formerly monastic, Teutonic State of Prussia]] to its south. From those two regions in 16th century [[Lutheran]] Protestantism started to spread into the country. Since [[1945]] [[Lutheranism]] in the country has declined. [[Baptist]], [[Calvinist]], and other Protestant churches have attempted to convert members into their faiths since [[1990]]. 

The country also has minority communities of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] (mainly among the [[Russia]]n minority), to which about 4.9 % of the total population belongs, as well as of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Karaism]] (an ancient offshoot of Judaism represented by a long-standing community in [[Trakai]]), which together make up another 1.6 % of the population.
