The '''Pamir languages''' are an [[Language area|areal]] group of the [[Eastern Iranian languages]], spoken by numerous people in the [[Pamir Mountains]], primarily along the [[Panj River]] and its tributaries. This includes the [[Badakhshan Province]] of Northeastern [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] of Eastern [[Tajikistan]]. Pamir communities are also be found in the adjacent [[Chitral District]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Gojal]], [[Gilgit Baltistan]] in [[Pakistan]].  [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], one of the languages of the Pamir group, is spoken beyond the [[Sarikol Range]] on the Afghanistan-China border, and thus qualifies as the easternmost of the extant Iranian languages. The only other living member of the Southeastern Iranian group is [[Pashto language|Pashto]].

No features uniting the Pamir languages as a single subgroup of Iranian have been demonstrated.<ref name="AW09">Antje Wendtland (2009), ''The position of the Pamir languages within East Iranian'', [http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:305500 Orientalia Suecana LVIII]</ref> The [[Ethnologue]] lists Pamir languages along with Pashto as Southeastern Iranian,<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=12-16 Southeastern Iranian Family Tree]. SIL International. Ethnologue: Languages of the World.</ref> however, according to [[Encyclopedia Iranica]], Pamir languages and Pashto belong to the North-Eastern Iranian branch.<ref name = "Iranica">Nicholas Sims-Williams, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eastern-iranian-languages Eastern Iranian languages], in Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, 2010. ''"The Modern Eastern Iranian languages are even more numerous and varied. Most of them are classified as North-Eastern: Ossetic; Yaghnobi (which derives from a dialect closely related to Sogdian); the Shughni group (Shughni, Roshani, Khufi, Bartangi, Roshorvi, Sarikoli), with which Yaz-1ghulami (Sokolova 1967) and the now extinct Wanji (J. Payne in Schmitt, p. 420) are closely linked; Ishkashmi, Sanglichi, and Zebaki; Wakhi; Munji and Yidgha; and Pashto."''</ref> Members of the Pamir language area include four reliable groups: a Shughni–Yazgulyam group including [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], and [[Yazgulyam language|Yazgulyam]]; [[Munji language|Munji]] and [[Yidgha language|Yidgha]]; [[Ishkashimi language|Ishkamimi]] and related dialects; and [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]]. They have the [[subject–object–verb]] [[syntactic]] [[Linguistic typology|typology]].

The vast majority of Pamir languages speakers in Tajikistan and Afghanistan also use [[Tajik language|Tajik]] (Persian) as literary language, which is&mdash;unlike the languages of the Pamir group&mdash;a [[Southwestern Iranian language|Southwestern Iranian]] tongue. The language group is endangered, with the total number of speakers roughly around 100,000 in 1990.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Pamir language family was sometimes referred to as the '''Ghalchah languages''' by western scholars.<ref name=avja>In his 1892 work on the [[Avestan language]] Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson, '''The later Iranian languages, New Persian, Kurdish, Afghan, Ossetish, Baluchi, Ghalach and some minor modern dialects." {{cite book |title=An Avesta grammar in comparison with Sanskrit and The Avestan alphabet and its transcription |last=Jackson |first=Abraham Valentine Williams  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1892 |publisher=AMS Press |location=[[Stuttgart]] |isbn= |page=xxx |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zboIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA38&dq=Ghalcha&lr=&as_brr=1&ei=LZToS9znI47qzASqtbXnCQ&cd=12#v=onepage&q=Ghalcha&f=false |accessdate=}}</ref> The term Ghalchah is no longer used to refer to the Pamir languages or the native speakers of these languages.

One of the most prolific researchers of the Pamir languages was [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Ivan Ivanovich Zarubin]].

==Shughni–Yazgulami branch==

The [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], and [[Yazgulyam language|Yazgulyam]] languages belong to the Shughni–Yazgulami branch. There are about 75,000 speakers of languages in this family in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikstan]] (including the dialects of [[Rushani language|Rushani]], [[Bartangi language|Bartangi]], [[Oroshor language|Oroshor]], [[Khufi language|Khufi]], and [[Shughni language|Shughni]]). In 1982, there were about 20,000 speakers of Sarikoli in the [[Sarikol Valley]] located in the [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]] in [[Xinjiang]] Province, [[China]]. Shughni and Sarikoli are not mutually intelligible. In 1994, there were 4000 speakers of Yazgulyam along the [[Yazgulyam River]] in [[Tajikistan]]. Yazgulyam is not written.

The [[Vanji language]] was spoken in the [[Vanj]] river valley the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] in [[Tajikistan]], and was related to [[Yazgulyam language|Yazgulyam]]. In the 19th century, the region was forcibly annexed to the [[Bukharan Emirate]] and a violent assimilation campaign was undertaken. By the end of the 19th century the Vanji language had disappeared, displaced by [[Tajik language|Tajik Persian]].

==Munji–Yidgha branch==

The [[Munji language|Munji]] and [[Yidgha language|Yidgha]] languages are closely related.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} There are about 6,000 speakers of [[Yidgha language|Yidgha]] in [[Pakistan]], and in 1992 there were around 2,500 speakers of Munji in the [[Munjan Valley|Munjan]] and [[Mamalgha Valley]]s of northeastern [[Afghanistan]]. Munji–Yidgha shares with [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] a development *ð > {{IPA|/l/}}, absent from the other three Pamir groups.

A probable third, extinct language of the branch was Sarghulami, spoken in Afghanistan until the early 20th century. The only known record of the language is a wordlist elicited from a Munji informant in 1916.

==سنګلیچي شکاشمي==

د [[سنګلیچي]] او [[اشکاشمي ژبه|شکاشمي]] ژبې ویونکي په افغانستان، تاجسکتان، کې څه باندې ۳۵۰۰ تنه ویونکي لري. 
ددې ژبې ګړدودونه: 
 ([[سنګلیچي]], [[شکاشمي ژبه|شکاشمي]], [[زیباکي]]) دي. د یادولو ده چې دا ژبې لیکنۍ ژبې نه دي.

==واخي==

د [[واخي ژبه|واخي ژبې]] ویونکي څه باندې ۵۸۰۰۰ تنه دي چې په [[افغانستان]], [[تاجکستان]], [[چین]], [[پاکستان]], [[روس]], او [[توریکه]] کې اوسېږي.
