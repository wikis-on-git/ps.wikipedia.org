'''Moksha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मोक्ष, ''liberation'') or '''Mukti''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मुक्ति, ''release'') refers, in Indian religions, to liberation from the [[samsara|cycle]] of death and [[rebirth]] and all the suffering and limitation entailed in embodied worldly existence. In higher [[Hindu philosophy]], it is seen as a transcendence of phenomenal being, of any sense of [[consciousness]] of [[time]], [[space]], and [[Causality|causation]] ([[karma]]). It is not seen as a [[soteriology|soteriological]] goal in the same sense as in, say, a [[Christian]] context, but signifies rather a dissolution of the sense of self as an egoistic personality - the undoing of conditioned mentality-materiality or ''nama-roopa'' (lit. name-form). Liberation is achieved by (and accompanied with) the complete stilling of all passions - a state of being known as [[Nirvana]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought differs slightly from the [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantist]] reading of liberation. [[Jainism]] and [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] traditions also believe in Moksha.

==Hinduism==

In [[Hinduism]], liberation occurs when the individual soul (human mind/spirit) or [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] recognizes its identity with the Ground of all being - the Source of all phenomenal existence known as [[Brahman]]. It is technically incorrect, nonetheless, to view them - both often spoken of as ''Self'' - as a monist being of sorts, something possessing substances, qualities or attributes. In actuality, [[Hindu scripture]] like the [[Upanishads]] and [[Bhagavad Gita]], and especially the non-dual Hindu school of [[Advaita Vedanta]], say that the Self or Super-Soul is beyond being and non-being, beyond any sense of tangibility and comprehension. Moksha is seen as a final release from one's worldly conception of self, the loosening of the shackle of experiential duality and a re-establishment in one's own fundamental nature, though the nature is seen as ineffable and beyond sensation. The actual state of salvation is seen differently depending on one's beliefs.

* In [[Advaita]] philosophy, the ultimate truth is not a singular Godhead, per se, but rather is oneness without form or being, something that essentially is without manifestation. Moksha is union with this oneness. The concepts of Moksha and Buddhist Nirvana are comparable. Indeed, there is much overlap in their views of consciousness and attainment of enlightenment. For  liberal Advaitists, Moksha is seen as complementing, rather than denying, the 'voidness' of Buddhism.

* In [[Dvaita|dualist]] and [[Vishistadvaita|qualified advaitic]] Hinduism, Moksha means union or close association with God. See [[Krishnology]].

===Means to achieve Moksha===

There are believed to be four [[yoga]]s (disciplines) or [[marg]]s (paths) for the attainment of Moksha. They are the ways of selfless work ([[Karma Yoga]]), of self-dissolving love ([[Bhakti Yoga]]), of absolute discernment ([[Jnana Yoga]]), and of 'royal' meditative immersion ([[Raja Yoga]]). Different schools of [[Hinduism]] place varying emphasis on one path or other, some of the most famous being the [[Tantra|tantric]] and [[Yoga|yogic]] practices developed in [[Hinduism]]. Today, the two major schools of thought are [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Bhakti]] branches.

# Bhakti sees the Self as God, most often a personified monotheistic conception of [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or [[Devi]] (the Mother Goddess). Unlike in Abrahamic traditions, this monotheism does not prevent a Hindu from worship of other aspects of God, beings or teachers, as they are all seen as rays from a single source. However, it is worthy of note that the Bhagavad Gita condemns worship of demigods, as it does not lead to Moksha. The concept is essentially of self-dissolution in love, since the ideal nature of being is seen as that of harmony, euphony, its manifest essence being love. By immersing oneself in the love of God, one's [[Karma]]s (good or bad, regardless) slough off, one's illusions about beings decay and 'truth' is soon known and lived. 
# [[Vedanta]] finds itself split three-fold, though the dualist and modified non-dualist schools are primarily associated with the foregoing thought of [[Bhakti]]. The most famous today is [[Advaita Vedanta]], a non-dual (i.e. no separation between the individual and reality/God/etc.) perspective which often played the role of [[Hindu]] foil to contemporary [[Buddhist]] philosophy. In general, it focused on intense meditation and moral realignment, its bedrock being the [[Upanishads]], [[Brahma Sutras]] and the teachings of its putative founder, [[Adi Shankara]]. Through discernment of the real and the unreal, as a peeling of the layers of an onion, the ''sadhak'' (practitioner) would unravel the [[maya (illusion)]] of being and the cosmos to find nothing within, a nothingness which was paradoxically being, and transcendentally beyond both such inadequate descriptions. This was [[Moksha]], this was [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] and [[Brahman]] realized as the substance and void of existential duality.

Moksha in the sacred Hindu temple dance, as in the [[classical Indian dance]] too, is symbolized by Shiva raising his right leg, as if freeing himself from the gravitation of the material world.

One must achieve Moksha on his or her own. An [[Arhat]] or a [[Siddha]] may inspire, but does not intervene.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the concept of Moksha is similar to that of Jainsim. It occurs when a soul is liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

==Jainism==
In [[Jainism]], Moksha and Nirvana are the same. When a soul (atman) achieves Nirvana, it is released from the cycle of births and deaths, and achieves its pure self. It then becomes a [[Siddha]] (literally one who has accomplished his ultimate objective), and hence a god, worthy of worship. 

In [[Jainism]], attaining Moksha requires annihilation of all karmas, good and bad; because if karma is left, it must bear fruit. 

==Surat Shbda Yoga==
In [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] beliefs, attaining Self-Realization and above results in [[Jiva]]n [[moksha|Moksha/Mukti]] (liberation/release from the cycle of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] while in the physical body – spiritual freedom here and now).
