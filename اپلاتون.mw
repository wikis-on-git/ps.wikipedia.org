'''افلاطون''' ([[يوناني ژبه|يوناني]]: Πλάτων, ''Plátōn'') (c.[[427 BC|427]]&ndash;c.[[347 BC]]) يو ډېر زيات اغېزناکه [[زوړ يوناني|زوړ يوناني فېلسوف]] او د [[سقراط]] زده کوونکی وه، هغه د فلسفي ديالوګونو ليکوال او په [[آتېن]] کې د [[اکادمۍ Academy]] بنسټګر دی، چېرته چې [[ارسطو]] هم زده کړې کړي. 

Plato lectured extensively at the Academy, and wrote on many philosophical issues, dealing especially in [[political philosophy|politics]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. The most important writings of Plato are his [[dialogue]]s, although a handful of [[epigram]]s also survived, and some [[letter]]s have come down to us under his name. It is believed that all of Plato's authentic dialogues survive. However, some dialogues ascribed to Plato by the Greeks are now considered by the consensus of scholars to be either suspect (e.g., ''[[Alcibiades (dialogues)|First Alcibiades]]'', ''[[Clitophon (dialogue)|Clitophon]]'') or probably spurious (such as ''[[Demodocus (dialogue)|Demodocus]]'', or the ''[[Alcibiades (dialogues)|Second Alcibiades]]''). The letters are all considered to probably be spurious, with the possible exception of the Seventh Letter.

The dialogues of Plato are lively, often humorous or ironic, full of memorable characters and humble detail.  It is generally agreed that Plato is the most enjoyable of philosophers to read.

[[Socrates]] is often a character in the dialogues of Plato. How much of the content and argument of any given dialogue is Socrates' point of view, and how much of it is Plato's, is heavily disputed, since Socrates himself did not write down his teachings; this ambiguity is often referred to as the "[[Socratic problem]]". However, Plato was doubtless strongly influenced by Socrates' teachings, so many of the ideas presented, at least in his early works, were likely borrowings or adaptations.

==ژوندليک==
Plato was born in Athens or [[Aegina]] in May or December in [[428 BC|428]] or [[427 BC]]. He was raised in a moderately well-to-do aristocratic family. His father was named Ariston, and his mother Perictione. His family claimed descent from the ancient [[King of Athens|Athenian kings]], and he was related &mdash; though there is disagreement as to exactly how &mdash; to the prominent politician [[Critias]]. According to a late [[Hellenistic]] account by [[Diogenes Laertius]], Plato's given name was ''Aristocles'', whereas his wrestling coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him ''Platon'', meaning ''broad'' on account of his robust figure. Diogenes mentions alternative accounts that Plato derived his name from the breadth (''platutês'') of his eloquence, or else because he was very wide (''platus'') across the forehead. According to [[Dicaearchus]], Plato wrestled at the [[Isthmian games]]. Such was his learning and ability that the ancient Greeks declared him to be the son of Apollo and told how, in his infancy, bees had settled on his lips, as prophecy of the honeyed words which were to flow from them.

Plato became a pupil of Socrates in his youth, and&mdash;at least according to his own account&mdash;he attended his master's trial, though not his execution. He was deeply affected by the city's treatment of Socrates, and much of his early work records his memories of his teacher. It is suggested that much of his [[ethics|ethical]] writing is in pursuit of a society where similar injustices could not occur. During the twelve years following the death of Socrates, he traveled extensively in Italy, Sicily, Egypt, and Cyrene in a quest for knowledge.

After his return to Athens at the age of 40, Plato founded one of the earliest known organized schools in Western civilization on a plot of land in the Grove of Academe. The [[Academy]] was "a large enclosure of ground which was once the property of a citizen at Athens named [[Academus]]... some, however, say that it received its name from an ancient hero" (Robinson, Arch. Graec. I i 16), and it operated until AD [[529]], when it was closed by [[Justinian I]] of [[Byzantium]], who saw it as a threat to the propagation of [[Christianity]]. Many intellectuals were schooled in the Academy, the most prominent one being [[Aristotle]].

Plato was also deeply influenced by a number of prior philosophers, including: the [[Pythagoreans]], whose notions of numerical [[harmony]] have clear echoes in Plato's notion of [[the Forms]]; [[Anaxagoras]], who taught Socrates and who held that the [[mind]], or [[reason]], pervades everything; and [[Parmenides]], who argued for the unity of all things and may have influenced Plato's concept of the [[soul]].

===Themes===
Unlike Socrates, Plato wrote down his philosophical views, leaving behind a considerable number of manuscripts.

In Plato's writings are debates concerning the best possible form of [[government]], featuring adherents of [[aristocracy]], [[democracy]], [[monarchy]] as well as other issues.  A central theme is the conflict between [[nature]] and [[convention]], concerning the role of [[heredity]] and the [[environmental psychology|environment]] on human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[personality]] long before the modern "[[nature versus nurture]]" debate began in the time of [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], with its modern continuation in such controversial works as ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' and ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

Another key distinction and theme in the Platonic corpus is the dichotomy between [[knowledge]] and [[opinion]], which foreshadow modern debates between [[David Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], and has been taken up by [[postmodern]]ists and their opponents, more commonly as the distinction between the '[[objective]]' and the '[[subjective]]'.

Even the story of the lost city or continent of [[Atlantis]] came to us as an illustrative story told by Plato in his ''[[Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias]]''.

Plato also had a position on the art of writing as opposed oral communication. This is evidenced in his [[Phaedrus]]{{rf|1|Plato1}} dialogue and his Seventh Epistle.{{rf|2|Plato2}} He said that oral communication is superior to the written word, especially in the accuracy of the oral word over the written word and in his Seventh Epistle that nothing of importance should be written down but transmitted orally.

===Form and basis===
Plato wrote mainly in the form known as [[dialogue]]. In the early dialogues, several characters discuss a topic by asking questions of one another. Socrates figures prominently, and a lively, more disorganized form of ''[[elenchos]]''/[[dialectic]] is present; these are called the [[Socratic Dialogue]]s.  

The nature of these dialogues changed a great deal over the course of Plato's life. It is generally agreed that Plato's earlier works are more closely based on Socrates' thought, whereas his later writing increasingly breaks away from the views of his former teacher. In the middle dialogues, Socrates becomes a mouthpiece for Plato's own philosophy, and the question-and-answer style is more ''[[pro forma]]'': the main figure represents Plato and the minor characters have little to say except "yes", "of course" and "very true". The late dialogues read more like [[treatise]]s, and Socrates is often absent or quiet. It is assumed that while some of the early dialogues could be based on Socrates' actual conversations, the later dialogues were written entirely by Plato.  The question of which, if any, of the dialogues are truly Socratic is known as the [[Socratic problem]].

The ostensible ''[[mise en scène]]'' of a dialogue distances both Plato and a given reader from the philosophy being discussed; one can choose between at least two options of [[perception]]: either to participate in the dialogues, in the [[idea]]s being discussed, or choose to see the [[content]] as expressive of the personalities contained within the work.

The dialogue format also allows Plato to put unpopular opinions in the mouth of unsympathetic characters, such as [[Thrasymachus]] in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.

:''Main article: [[Platonic idealism]]''

'''Platonism''' has traditionally been interpreted as a form of metaphysical [[dualism]], sometimes referred to as '''Platonic''' or '''Exaggerated Realism'''. According to this reading, Plato's metaphysics divides the world into two distinct aspects: the intelligible world of "forms", and the perceptual world we see around us.  The perceptual world consists of imperfect copies of the intelligible ''[[form]]s'' or ''[[idea]]s''. These forms are unchangeable and perfect, and are only comprehensible by the use of the intellect or understanding&mdash;i.e., a capacity of the mind that does not include [[perception|sense-perception]] or [[imagination]]. This division can also be found  in [[Zoroaster|Zoroastrian]] philosophy, in which the dichotomy is referenced as the ''Minu'' (intelligence) and ''Giti'' (perceptual) worlds. The [[Zoroastrian]] ideal city, ''Shahrivar'', also exhibits certain similarities with Plato's ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]''. The existence and  direction of influence here is uncertain; while [[Zoroaster]] lived well before Plato, few of the earliest writings of Zoroastrianism survive unaltered. 

[[Image:PlatosCave.gif|thumb|right|350px|Illustrating Plato's Allegory of the Cave]]
In the ''Republic'' Books VI and VII, Plato uses a number of [[metaphor]]s to explain his metaphysical views: the [[Plato's metaphor of the sun|metaphor of the sun]], the well-known [[Plato's allegory of the cave|allegory of the cave]], and most explicitly, [[the divided line of Plato|the divided line]].

Taken together, these metaphors convey a complex, and, in places, difficult theory: there is something called [[The Form of the Good]] (often interpreted as Plato's God), which is the ultimate object of [[knowledge]] and which, as it were, sheds light on all the other forms (i.e., [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]: [[abstraction|abstract]] [[kind (word)|kinds]] and [[attribute]]s), and from which all other forms "emanate".  The Form of the Good does this in somewhat the same way as the sun sheds light on, or makes visible and "generates" things, in the perceptual world. (See [[Plato's metaphor of the sun]])

In the perceptual world, the particular objects we see around us bear only a dim resemblance to the more ultimately real forms of Plato's intelligible world; it is as if we are seeing shadows of cut-out shapes on the walls of a cave, which are mere representations of the [[reality]] outside the cave, illuminated by the sun. (See [[Plato's allegory of the cave]])

We can imagine everything in the [[universe]] represented on a line of increasing reality; it is divided once in the middle, and then once again in each of the resulting parts. The first division represents that between the intelligible and the perceptual worlds. This is followed by a ''corresponding'' division in each of these worlds: the segment representing the perceptual world is divided into segments representing "real things" on the one hand, and shadows, reflections and representations on the other. Similarly, the segment representing the intelligible world is divided into segments representing [[first principle]]s and most general forms, on the one hand, and more derivative, "reflected" forms, on the other. (See [[the divided line of Plato]])

The form of government derived from this philosophy turns out to be one of a rigidly fixed [[hierarchy]] of [[hereditary]] [[social class]]es, in which the [[arts]] are mostly suppressed for the good of the state, the size of the city and its social classes is determined by mathematical formulae, and [[eugenics|eugenic]] measures are applied secretly by rigging the lotteries in which the right to reproduce is allocated. The exact relationship of such a government to the lofty philosophy presented in the book has been debated.

Plato's metaphysics, and particularly its [[dualism]] between the intelligible and the perceptual, would inspire later [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] thinkers, such as [[Plotinus]] and [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], and many other metaphysical realists. Although Platonistic philosophers like Plotinus rebuked Gnosticism (see Plotinus' [[Enneads]]). One reason being the Gnostic vilification of nature and Plato's [[Demiurge]] from ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. Plato also influenced [[Saint Justin Martyr]]. For more on Platonic realism in general, see [[Platonic realism]] and [[the Forms]]. 

Although this interpretation of Plato's writings (particularly the [[Republic]]) has enjoyed immense popularity throughout the long history of Western philosophy, it is also possible to interpret his suggestions more conservatively, favoring a more epistemological than metaphysical reading of such famous metaphors as the Cave and the Divided Line.  There are obvious parallels between the Cave allegory and the life of Plato's teacher [[Socrates]] (who was killed in his attempt to "open the eyes" of the Athenians).  This example reveals the dramatic complexity that often lies under the surface of Plato's writing (remember that in the [[Republic]], it is Socrates who relates the story.).

===منځوي ډيالوګونه===
Late in the early dialogues Plato's Socrates actually begins supplying answers to some of the questions he asks, or putting forth positive doctrines.  This is generally seen as the first appearance of Plato's own views.  The first of these, that goodness is wisdom and that no one does evil willingly, was perhaps Socrates' own view.  What becomes most prominent in the middle dialogues is the idea that knowledge comes of grasping unchanging forms or essences, paired with the attempts to investigate such essences.  The immortality of the soul, and specific doctrines about justice, truth, and beauty, begin appearing here.  The [[Symposium]] and the [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] are considered the centrepieces of Plato's middle period.

====وروستي ډيالوګونه====
The [[Parmenides]] presents a series of criticisms of the Theory of Forms which are widely taken to indicate Plato's abandonment of the doctrine.  In most of the remaining dialogues the theory is absent (the [[Timaeus]] is an important, and hence controversially placed, exception).  Socrates is either absent or a minor figure in the discussion.
