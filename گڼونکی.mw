An '''Accountant''' is a practitioner of [[accountancy]], which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and other decision makers make resource allocation decisions.

The word "Accountant" is derived from the French word 'Compter' which took its origin from the Latin word 'Computare'. The word was formerly written in English as "Accomptant", but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the "p", became gradually changed both in pronunciation and in orthography to its present form.<ref>Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy - constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4[http://www.archive.org/download/accountancyconst00pixluoft/accountancyconst00pixluoft.pdf]</ref>

===Canada===
In Canada, there are three recognized accounting bodies: the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CA) and the provincial and territorial CA Institutes, [[Certified General Accountant|the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada (CGA)]], and the [[Society of Management Accountants of Canada]], also known as the Certified Management Accountants (CMA). CA and CGA were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively and CMA was established in 1920.

The CA program focuses on public accounting and candidates must obtain auditing experience from public accounting firms; the CGA program takes a general approach allowing candidates to focus in their own financial career choices; the CMA program focuses in management accounting. The CA and CMA programs require a candidate to obtain a degree as a program entry requirement. The CGA program requires a degree as an exit requirement prior to certification.

Auditing and Public Accounting are regulated by the provinces. Historically, only CAs can perform audits in [[Ontario]]. In 2004, the provincial government of [[Ontario]] passed a new Public Accounting Act that would allow qualified CGAs and CMAs to perform audits, conditional on their organizations being able to demonstrate that their qualification and regulatory programs are equivalent in rigour to that of the CA program. As of March 2006, this process of evaluation had not yet begun. In [[Quebec]] as well, CAs still have exclusive public company audit rights by statute. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], CAs and CGAs have equal status regarding public accounting and auditing; In the rest of [[Canada]], CAs, CGAs, and CMAs are considered equivalents pursuant to provincial and territorial legislation.

As of year 2006, the Chartered Certified Accountant ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] or FCCA) is also recognized by Canadian government as an eligible qualification to audit federal government institutions in Canada. Furthermore, The Canadian branch of [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] is pursuing recognition for statutory audit purposes in the province of Ontario under the province's Public Accounting Act of 2004.

===Australia===
In Australia there are four main local professional accountancy bodies.

*'''Certified Practicing Accountants''' (CPA) are members of [[CPA Australia]].
*'''Professional National Accountants''' (PNA) and '''Member of National Institute of Accountants''' (MNIA) are members of [[National Institute of Accountants]] Australia.

*'''[[Chartered Accountant#Australia|Chartered Accountants]]''' are members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia.

However, the Chartered Certified Accountant ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] or FCCA) qualification is also recognized as a prescribed body for insolvency purposes under the Corporation Act 2001, section 1282 and for audit purposes by ASIC under Practice Statement 180 Auditor recognition in [[Australia]].

Additionally the [[Institute of Certified Management Accountants]] (ICMA) awards the CMA designation, and is specialized in the area of [[Management Accounting]].

==United States of America==
In the [[United States]], legally practicing accountants are [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), and other non-statutory accountants are [[Certified Internal Auditor]]s (CIAs), [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs) and [[Accredited Business Accountant]]s (ABAs).  The difference between these certifications is primarily the legal status and the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification.  Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant.

A CPA is licensed by the state of his/her residence to provide auditing services to the public, although most CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services.  The requirements for receiving the CPA license varies from state to state, although the passage of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant examination is required by all states. [http://www.accountingmajors.com/accountingmajors/articles/cpa-exam.html] This examination is designed and graded by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].

A CIA is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate passed a rigorous examination of four parts. A CIA mostly provides his/her services directly to his/her employer rather than the public.

A CMA is granted a certificate from the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate passed a rigorous examination of four parts and meet the practical experience requirement from the IMA.  A CMA mostly provides his/her services directly to his/her employers rather than the public.  A CMA can also provide his services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.

An ABA is granted accreditation from the [[Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation]] (ACAT), provided that the candidate passed the eight-hour Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which tests proficiency in financial accounting, reporting, statement preparation, taxation, business consulting services, business law, and ethics. An ABA specializes in the needs of small-to-mid-size businesses and in financial services to individuals and families. In states where use of the word "accountant” is not permitted by non state licensed individuals, the practitioner may use Accredited Business adviser.

The [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that there are about one million persons [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm] employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.

[[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax law]] grants accountants a limited form of [[accountant-client privilege]].

== Hong Kong==
{{main|Accountancy in Hong Kong}}

<br />
In November 2008, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited has removed the requirement for a qualified accountant from the Listing Rules but expanded the Code Provisions in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices regarding internal controls to make specific references to the responsibility of the directors to conduct an annual review of the adequacy of staffing of the financial reporting function and the oversight role of the audit committee.
