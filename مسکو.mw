Likewise, it is the [[Largest European metropolitan areas|most populous city in Europe]]. Historically, its position was central in the Russian homeland. It was the capital of the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Muscovite Russia]], the pre-Imperial Russian state. It is the site of the famous [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], which now serves as the ceremonial residence of the [[President of the Russian Federation|President]].

Moscow's architecture and performing arts culture are world-renowned. Moscow is also well known as the site of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], with its elegant [[onion dome]]s, as well as the [[Cathedral of Christ the Savior]]. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]], whose residence is the [[Danilov Monastery]], serves as the head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

Moscow developed into a stable and prosperous principality for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia. 

Under [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] the city replaced [[Tver]] as capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] and became the sole collector of taxes for the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatar]] rulers. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the [[Khan]]. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons but was passed intact to his eldest. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the [[Tatars]] in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. After that, Moscow took the leading role in liberating [[Russia]] from [[Tatar]] domination. In 1480, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] had [[Great standing on the Ugra river|finally broken the Russians free]] from [[Tatars|Tatar]] control, allowing Moscow to become the center of power in [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html |title=The Mongol Connection: Mongol Influences on the Development of Moscow |last=Vogel |first=Michael |publisher=Indiana University South Bend |accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref> The Russian capital, which had wandered from Kiev to Vladimir, came to rest in this city by the end of his reign, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of present-day Russia and parts of other lands. 

The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the [[Time of Troubles|liberation of Moscow from the Polish-Lithuanian invaders]] (1612), the [[Salt Riot]] (1648), the [[Copper Riot]] (1662), and the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]]. The city ceased to be Russia's capital in 1712, after the founding of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]] in 1703. When [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] invaded in 1812, the Muscovites burned the city and evacuated, as Napoleon's forces were approaching on [[September 14]].  Napoleon's army, plagued by hunger, cold, and poor supply lines, was forced to retreat. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or [[Mayor]], was officially introduced in Moscow, and [[Alexander Adrianov]] became Moscow's first official mayor. Following the success of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], on [[March 12]], [[1918]], Moscow became the capital of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and the [[Soviet Union]] less than five years later.<ref name="embassy-geo">{{cite web|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/GEOGRAF.HTM |title=Geographi |publisher=The Russian Embassy |accessdate=2006-07-18}}</ref> [[دوتنه:Kremlevskaya Naberezhnaja Moscow.hires.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Kremlin Embankment and Moscow skyline with [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] on the left and [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] on the right]]

During the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the [[Red Army]] was located in Moscow. In 1941, sixteen divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), twenty-five battalions (18,500 people) and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. In November 1941, German [[Army Group Center]] was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from [[October 20]] the city was declared to be under [[siege]]. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. It is of some note that Stalin refused to leave the city, meaning the general staff and the council of people's commissars remained in the city as well. Despite the siege and the bombings, the construction of [[Moscow Metro|Moscow's metro system]], which began in the early 1930s, continued through the war and by the end of the war several new metro lines were opened. On [[May 1]], [[1944]] a medal ''For the defence of Moscow'' and in 1947 another medal ''In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow'' were instituted. On [[May 8]], [[1965]] in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the victory in [[World War II]], Moscow was one of twelve Soviet cities awarded the title of the [[Hero City]]. In 1980, it hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]].

In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by the government members opposed to the reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When the [[USSR]] was dissolved in the same year, Moscow continued to be the capital of [[Russia]]. Since then, the emergence of a [[market economy]] in Moscow has produced an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, [[architecture]], and lifestyles.

== حکومت ==
[[دوتنه:Msk all districts abc eng.svg|thumb|225px|The [[district]]s of Moscow]]
Moscow is the seat of power for the Russian Federation. At the center of the city, in the [[Central Administrative Okrug, Moscow|Central Administrative Okrug]], is the [[Moscow Kremlin]], which houses the home of the [[President of Russia]] as well as many of the facilities for the national government. This includes numerous [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|military headquarters]] and the headquarters of the [[Moscow Military District]]. Moscow, like with any national [[capital]], is also the host of all the foreign [[diplomatic missions|embassies]] and diplomats representing a multitude of nations in Russia. On a slightly smaller scale, Moscow is located within the [[Central Federal District]], one of the seven [[federal districts of Russia]]. As result, it falls under the administration of a representative appointed by the [[President of Russia]] to head the district. Moscow is also designated as one of only two federal cities - [[Saint Petersburg]] being the other - within Russia. Since all [[Federal subjects of Russia|Russian subjects]] - republics, provinces, cities, and territories - have two representatives within the [[Federation Council of Russia]], the over 10 million Muscovites are represented by just two people - 1.1% of the Council - despite the fact that they account for 7.3% of the total population of Russia. Lastly, Moscow is located within the [[central economic region]], one of [[Economic regions of Russia|twelve regions]] within Russia with similar economic goals.

The entire city of Moscow is headed by one [[mayor]] (currently [[Yuriy Luzhkov]]). It is divided into 10 administrative and 123 municipal districts ([[okrug]]s). Administrative districts: Zelenogradskiy Administrative Okrug (City of [[Zelenograd]] in the federal classification), Northern Administrative Okrug, North-Eastern Administrative Okrug, North-Western Administrative Okrug, [[Central Administrative Okrug, Moscow|Central Administrative Okrug]], Eastern Administrative Okrug, Southern Administrative Okrug, South-Eastern Administrative Okrug, South-Western Administrative Okrug, and Western Administrative Okrug. Nine of the ten administrative districts, except of Zelenogradskiy, are located within City of Moscow main boundaries.

Each administrative district consists of several municipal districts ([[raion]]s). Each municipal and administrative district has its own [[coat of arms]], flag, and elected head official. Additionally, most raions have their own cable television, computer network, and official newspaper. Along with municipal districts are Territorial Unities with Special Status or territories. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations, such as the case with the [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre]], the [[Botanical Garden]], large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different raions. There are no ethnic-specific raions in Moscow in the manner [[Chinatown]]s exist in some [[North America]]n and [[East Asia]]n cities. And although raions are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, [[Moscow metro|metro]] stations or green zones are considered more prestigious. 

In addition to being the capital of Russia, Moscow is the capital of the [[Moscow Oblast]]. Since Moscow is a [[Federal cities of Russia|Federal City]], it is not actually within the oblast. (See [[List of capitals outside of the territories they serve]].)

[[دوتنه:ClimateMoscowRussia.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Average temperature (red) and precipitations (blue) in Moscow]]
Moscow is exposed to cold winters, warm and mild summers, and very brief spring and autumn seasons. Typical high temperatures in the warm months of July and August are around 23[[Celsius|°C]] (68[[Fahrenheit|°F]]); in the winter, temperatures normally drop to approximately -12[[Celsius|°C]] (10[[Fahrenheit|°F]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/RSXX0063?from=search |title=Monthly Averages for Moscow, Russia |accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref> Monthly rainfall totals vary minimally throughout the year, although the [[precipitation]] levels tend to be higher during the summer than during the winter. Due to the significant variation in temperature between the winter and summer months as well as the limited fluctuation in precipitation levels during the summer, Moscow is considered to be within a [[continental climate]] zone.

== City layout ==
[[دوتنه:Map of Moscow 1784.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The layout of Moscow, from a 1784 map]]
Moscow is situated on the banks of the [[Moskva River]], which flows for just over five hundred kilometers through western Russia, in the center of the East-European plain. 

Moscow's road system is centered roughly around the heart of the city, the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. From there, the roads in general radiate out to intersect with a sequence of circular roads or "rings" focused at the Kremlin.

The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso ([[Boulevard Ring]]), was built at the former location of the [[16th century|sixteenth century]] city wall around what used to be called [[Bely Gorod]] (White Town).<ref name="golden-ring" /> The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a [[horseshoe]]-like arc that goes from the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] to the [[Yauza River]]. In addition, the Boulevard Ring changes street names numerous times throughout its journey across the city.

The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso ([[Garden Ring]]). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a sixteenth century wall that used to encompass part of the city.<ref name="golden-ring" /> The third ring, the Third Transport Ring, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed [[freeway]]. The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, is currently under construction to further reduce traffic congestion. The outermost ring within Moscow is the [[MKAD|Moscow Automobile Ring Road]] (often called the ''MKAD'' from the Russian ''Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога''), which forms the approximate boundary of the city.

Outside the city, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits.

== Architecture ==
[[دوتنه:ost.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Ostankino Tower]] - the tallest free-standing structure in [[Eurasia]]]] 
For a long time the view of the city was dominated by numerous orthodox churches. The look of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, mostly due to [[Joseph Stalin]], who oversaw a large-scale effort to modernize the city. He introduced broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, but he also destroyed a great number of historically significant architectural works. The [[Sukharev Tower]], as well as numerous mansions and stores lining the major streets, and various works of religious architecture, such as the [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazan Cathedral]] and the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], were all destroyed during Stalin's rule. During the 1990s, however, both the latter were rebuilt.

Architect [[Vladimir Shukhov]] was responsible for building several of Moscow's landmarks during early Soviet Russia. The [[Shukhov Tower]], just one of many [[Hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid towers]] designed by Shukhov, was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a [[Russia]]n broadcasting company.<ref name="stako">{{cite web|url=http://www.stako.ru/HOME_EMm.htm |publisher=Melnikov Institute |title=Memorial |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the [[constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the [[State Universal Store|Upper Trade Rows (GUM)]] on [[Red Square]],<ref name="stako" /> bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults. 

Stalin, however, is also credited with building the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|The Seven Sisters]], comprising seven, cathedral-like structures. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Municipal Building in [[New York]], and their style - with intricate exteriors and a large central spire - has been described as ''[[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist gothic architecture]]''. All seven towers can be seen from most elevations in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the [[Ostankino Tower]] which, when it was completed in 1967, was the tallest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's second-tallest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2000/08/30/170-print.html |publisher=Reuters ''via'' The Moscow Times |accessdate=2006-07-06 |date=[[2000-08-30]] |title=Moscow TV Broadcasts Set to Resume After Fire |last=Shukshin |first=Andrei}}</ref>
The Soviet policy of providing mandatory housing for every citizen or their family, and the rapid growth of the Muscovite population in Soviet times, also led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks, which can often be differentiated by age, sturdiness of construction, or 'style' according to the neighborhood and the materials used. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power - Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc - and they are usually ill-maintained. The Stalinist-era constructions, usually in the central city, are massive and usually ornamented with [[Socialist realism]] motifs that imitate [[classical architecture|classical]] themes. However, small churches - almost always [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] - that hint on the city's past still dot various parts of the city. The Old [[Arbat]], a popular tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the [[20th century|twentieth century]]. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist [[façade]]s of [[Tverskaya Street]], for example) are also examples of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] decadence in [[Tsar]]ist times. [[Ostankino]], [[Kuskovo]], [[Uzkoye]] and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some [[:Category:Monasteries in Moscow|convents and monasteries]], both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.

Attempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These revamped structures are easily spotted by their bright new colours and spotless facades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet [[avant-garde]] work too, such as the house of the architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the [[Arbat]] area. Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-[[Modernist]] styles employed, such as with the [[Novy Arbat]] project, familiarly known as "false teeth of Moscow" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in the Moscow downtown involved in the project.

Like in [[London]], but on a broader scale, plaques on the house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well-known to the outside world. There are also many 'house-museums' of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.

=== Museums and galleries ===
[[دوتنه:Gmii.jpg|The [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]]|thumb|right|250px]] 
Many of Moscow's museums and galleries have [[Collection (museum)|collections]] that can be compared to those of the best museums of [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]. Frequent art exhibitions thrive on both the new and the classic, as they once did in pre-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] times, and are derived from diverse branches of the arts - [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[sculpture]]. 

One of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], which was founded by [[Pavel Tretyakov]], a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.<ref>See also: [http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/english/ The Official Site of the Tretyakov Gallery] Retrieved on [[2006-07-08]].</ref> Currently the Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov, the original gallery in the [[Tretyakovskaya]] area on the south bank of the [[Moskva River]], houses the works of the classic Russian tradition.<ref name="trety">{{cite web|url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/english/about.shtml |title=About The State Tretyakov Gallery |accessdate=2006-07-10 |publisher=The State Tretyakov Gallery}}</ref> The works of famous pre-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] painters, such as [[Ilya Repin]], as well as the works of early Russian [[icon painting|icon painters]] can be found in the Old Tretyakov Gallery. Visitors can even see rare originals by early-[[15th century|fifteenth century]] [[iconography|iconographer]] [[Andrei Rublev]].<ref name="trety" /> The New Tretyakov, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary artists, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early twentieth century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s famous ''[[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]]'' and a mixture of other [[avant-garde]] works by artists like [[Kazimir Malevich]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. [[Socialist realism]] features can also be find within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.
[[دوتنه:Tretyakovgallery.jpg|[[Tretyakov Gallery]]|thumb|left|200px]]

Another art museum in the city of Moscow is the [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], which was founded by, among others, [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]'s father. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] in that its halls are a cross-section of world civilizations, with many plaster casts of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts famous paintings from every major Western era of art; works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] are all sampled there.

The [[State Historical Museum]] of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history wedged between [[Red Square]] and [[Manege Square]] in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers in the millions. The [[Polytechnical Museum]]<ref>See also: {{ru_icon}} [http://eng.polymus.ru/rv/ The Official Site of the Polytechnical Museum] Retrieved on [[2006-07-23]]. ({{en icon}} [http://eng.polymus.ru/rv/ English version])</ref>, founded in 1872 is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata of the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.polymus.ru/?s=19&lvl=1 |title=The Museum Collections |publisher=Polytechnical Museum |accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref> The [[Borodino Panorama]]<ref>See also: [http://www.1812panorama.ru/ The official site of Borodino Panorama museum]</ref> museum located on Kutuzov Avenue provides an opportunity for visitors to experience being on a battlefield with a 360° [[diorama]]. It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon's army, that includes also the Triumphal arch erected in 1827.

=== Theatres and other performing arts ===
[[دوتنه:Bolshoi_th.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bolshoi theater]]
Moscow is also the heart of Russian performing arts, including [[Russian ballet|ballet]] and film. There are ninety-three theaters, 132 cinemas and twenty-four concert-halls in Moscow<ref name="mosru-stats" />. 

Among Moscow's many theatres and ballet studios is the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and the [[Malyi Theatre]] as well as [[Vakhtangov Theatre]] and [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. The repertories in a typical Moscow season are exhaustive and modern interpretations of classic works, whether operatic or theatrical, are quite common. [[State Central Concert Hall Rossia]] <ref>See also: [http://www.gckz.ru/english/rossia.html The Official Site of the State Central Concert Hall "Rossia"]. Retrieved on [[2006-07-17]].</ref>, famous for ballet and estrade performances, is the place of frequent concerts of pop-stars such as [[Alla Pugacheva]] and is situated in the soon to be demolished building of [[Hotel Rossiya]], the largest hotel in Europe.

It also has the largest [[Organ (music)|organ]] in Russia installed in Svetlanov hall.

There are also two large [[circus]]es in Moscow: [[Moscow State Circus]] and [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard]] <ref>See also: {{ru_icon}} [http://www.circusnikulin.ru/ The Official Site of the Moscow Nikulun Circus]. Retrieved on [[2006-07-17]].</ref> named after [[Yuri Nikulin]].

Soviet films are integral to film history and the [[Mosfilm]] studio was at the heart of many Soviet classic films as it is responsible for both artistic and mainstream productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mosfilm.ru/index.php?File=units/eng/history.htm&Style=text&Lang=eng |title=History of the Mosfilm concern studios foundation |publisher=MosFilm |accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> . However, despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally-renowned Russian filmmakers, the once prolific native studios are much quieter. Rare and historical films may be seen in Salut cinema where films from the [[Museum of Cinema]] <ref>See also: [http://www.museikino.ru The Official Site of the Museum of Cinema].

Moscow is home to more Olympic champions than any other city in the world.{{fact}} It was the host city of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], although the [[yachting]] events were held at [[Tallinn]], in present-day [[Estonia]]. Large athletic facilities and the main international airport, Sheremetyevo Terminal 2, were built in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow had also made a bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. However, when final voting commenced on [[July 6]], [[2005]], Moscow was the first city to be eliminated from further rounds. The Games were finally awarded to [[London 2012|London]].

Clubs such as [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo]], [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]],[[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]] and [[Zenit Saint Petersburg]] are prominent on the European stage.

Because of Moscow's cold locale, [[winter sport]]s have a large following as well. Many of Moscow's large parks offer marked trails for skiers and frozen ponds and canals for skaters.

Moscow also hosts the annual [[Kremlin Cup]], a popular [[tennis]] tournament on both the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] and [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tours. In 2006 the event is to be held from the 9th-15th October on both the women and men's tennis tour.

Several Moscow institutions have divisions in other regions and countries around the world, including Russian neighbor [[Mongolia]].

Although Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards [[engineering]] or the fundamental science, in recent years Moscow has seen a significant growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in [[Business school|business]] and [[management]]. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and increased their student enrollments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] degrees, including the [[Master of Business Administration]]. [[Student exchange program]]s with different (especially, [[Europe]]an) countries also have become widespread in Moscow's universities, while many schools within the Russian capital will also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.

== Science and research ==
[[دوتنه:Sk334.jpg|thumb|right|The headquarters of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], Moscow|250px]]
Moscow is known as one of the most important science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] are located in Moscow as well as numerous research and applied science institutions.

The [[Kurchatov Institute]], Russia's leading research and development institution in the field of nuclear energy, where the first [[nuclear reactor]] in Europe was built, [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]], [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]], [[Institute for Physical Problems|Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems]] and [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] are all situated in Moscow.

== Transport ==
=== Intercity transport ===
[[دوتنه:trvn2.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Electric railway ([[elektrichka]]) station in [[Vnukovo Airport]]]]
There are five airports serving Moscow: [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]], [[Domodedovo International Airport]], [[Bykovo Airport]], [[Ostafievo International Airport]] and [[Vnukovo International Airport]]. Sheremetyevo International Airport is the most common entry point for foreign passengers (as it handles sixty percent of all international flights)<ref name="4airports">{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/feature/2004/06/21/airports.shtml |publisher=MosNews |title=A City of Four Airports |date=[[2004-06-21]] |accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> although other airports also serve the city of Moscow, particularly with flights within Russia and to and from states from the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/byplane.html |accessdate=2006-07-03 |title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Plane |publisher=The Moscow Times}}</ref> [[Domodedovo International Airport]] is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput. Moscow's airports are at different distances from the city center; Bykovo Airport is the farthest of the five, located 35 [[kilometer]]s (21 [[mile]]s) from the city center<ref name="4airports" /> and Ostafievo airport is the nearest.

[[دوتنه:srv2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[North river terminal]] in Moscow]]
Likewise, Moscow employs several train stations to serve the city. All of Moscow's nine rail terminals (or ''vokzals'') - [[Belorusskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Kazanskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Kievskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Kurskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Leningradskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Paveletskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Rizhskiy Rail Terminal]], [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal|Savyolovskiy Rail Terminal]], and [[Yaroslavlskiy Rail Terminal]] - are located close to the city center, but they each handle trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.<ref name="mostimestrain">{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |publisher=The Moscow Times |title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Train |accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref> There are also many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As trains are relatively cheap, they are the mode of preference for travelling Russians, especially when departing to [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is also the western terminus of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which traverses nearly 9300 kilometers of territory to [[Vladivostok]].

Moscow also has two passenger river terminials ([[South River Terminal]] and [[North River Terminal]] or Rechnoy vokzal) and regular motorship routes and cruises along [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Oka River|Oka]] rivers used mostly for entertainment. North river terminal, built in 1937 is also the main hub for long-lange river routes. There are also three freight ports serving Moscow. Besides this Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses ([[Moscow Avtovokzal]]) with daily overturn of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow<ref>See also: {{ru icon}} [http://www.kvartirant.ru/news/?news_id=10891&date=12.05.2006&date2=2006-05-12] Realty news].

=== Local transport ===
[[دوتنه:Moscowmetro-2005-2.png|right|thumb|220px|Map of the [[Moscow Metro]]]]
Local transport includes the [[Moscow Metro]], a [[Rapid transit|metro]] system famous for its art, [[mural]]s, [[mosaic]]s, and ornate [[chandelier]]s. When it first opened in 1935, the system had just one line. But today, the Moscow Metro contains twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 172 stations. [[Park Pobedy]] ("Victory Park"), completed in 2003, is the deepest metro station in the world, which also contains the longest [[escalator]]s in Europe. The Moscow Metro is [[Top 10 rail systems in terms of annual passenger rides|one of world's busiest]] metro system, serving more than seven million passengers daily.<ref name="metro">{{ru icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=99 |title=Московский метрополитен |accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>  There is also a [[Moscow monorail|monorail line]], operated by the same company. Facing serious transportation problems Moscow has wide plans of expansion of Moscow Metro.

[[دوتنه:mon2.jpg|left|thumb|220px|[[Moscow Monorail]]]]
As Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to four kilometers, an extensive bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Suburbs and satellite cities also connected by commuter [[elektrichka|electric rail network]]. The buses are very frequent, often more than one a minute. Every large street in the city is served by at least one bus route. There are also extensive [[tram]] and [[trolleybus]] networks.

There are over 2.6 million cars in the city on a daily basis.<ref name="mosru-stats" /> Recent years have seen explosive growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and the lack of parking space to become major problems.

The [[MKAD]], along with the [[Third Ring|Third Transport Ring]] and the future [[Fourth Transport Ring]], is one of only three [[freeway]]s that run within Moscow city limits. However, as one can easily observe from a map of Moscow area, there are several other roadway systems that form [[concentric circles]] around the city.

[[دوتنه:moscowskyline.jpg|thumb|230px|Moscow skyline in 2006, with construction in the right.]]
In 2006, [[Mercer Management Consulting]] named Moscow the world's [[List of most expensive cities|most expensive city]], ahead of perennial winner [[Tokyo]], due to the stable [[Russian ruble]] as well as increasing housing prices within the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/23/pf/expensive_cities/index.htm |last=Sahadi |first=Jeanne |date=[[2006-06-23]] |accessdate=2006-07-04 |publisher=CNNMoney |title=World's most expensive cities}}</ref> Some prices are considerably higher for the foreign visitor than for locals. For locals, small apartments bought or given by the state in the Soviet era, coupled with extremely low utility costs and a low income tax of 13% serve to lower the [[cost of living]] greatly.

=== Business and Trade ===
A significant portion of Russia's profits and development is concentrated in Moscow as many multi-national corporations have branches and offices in the city. The plush offices and the lifestyles of the typical corporate employee in Moscow are often indistinguishable from any other [[Western Europe]]an city, although the average salary for the Muscovite is lower.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/04-08-2005/8687-salary-0 |publisher=Pravda |title=Average monthly salaries hit all-time high in Russia |date=[[2005-08-04]] |accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> Since the [[Russian financial crisis]] in late 1998, various business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use.

However, while the overall stability has improved in the recent years, crime and corruption continue to remain a problem hindering business development. The Mafia also runs [[extortion|extortion rackets]] in most parts of the city, though there are no reliable data to understand how large their influence is.

The Cherkizovskiy marketplace, controlled by the [[Azeri]] diaspora is the largest marketplace in Europe with daily turnover of about thirty million dollars and about ten thousand sellers<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.newtimes.ru/artical.asp?n=3111&art_id=6991|last=Aleksandrov |first=Yuri |date=[[2005-12-11]] |accessdate=2006-07-07 |title=Новые лимитчики |publisher=New Times |accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> from different countries (including the [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[India]]).

=== Industry ===
Primary [[industry|industries]] in Moscow include the [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[metallurgy]], [[Food industry|food]], [[textile]], [[furniture]], and [[machine]]ry industries.

The [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant]] is one of the leading producers of military and civil helicopters in the world. Automobile plants [[ZiL]] and [[AZLK]], as well as the [[Voitovich Rail Vehicle plant]], are situated in Moscow. The [[Poljot|Poljot Moscow watch factory]] produces reliable military, professional and sport watches well known in Russia and abroad.

There are also many other industries located just outside the city of Moscow, as well as many microelectronic industries in [[Zelenograd]].

Despite the economic growth experienced in Moscow since the dawn of the [[21st century|twenty-first century]], many industries have undergone various crises in recent years. Some of them has been sold to foreign [[investment|investors]], such as [[OTIS]] and [[British American Tobacco]], and others have been closed down to make for new buildings constructed as business centers. Additionally, some industry is now being transferred out of Moscow to improve the ecological state of the city. Nevertheless, the city of Moscow remains one of Russia's major industrial centers.

=== Living costs ===
[[دوتنه:tpb.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[Triumph-Palace|Triumph-Palace building]], built in 2005, the tallest building in Europe (second place holds [[Commerzbank Tower]] in Frankfurt) is just one of many prestigious residential complexes]] 
During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). [[Private ownership]] of apartments was limited until 1990, when people were permitted to secure property rights to the places they inhabited. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area. Due to the current economic situation, the price of [[real estate]] in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $3800 in average per square meter in the outskirts of the city or $6000-$7000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed $40000 per square meter in a flat. <ref>{{ru_icon}} [http://www.regnum.ru/news/643249.html The absolute record of realty cost is broken]</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Humphries |first=Conor |title=Dividing the Spoils of the Boom |url=http://www.stroi.ru/eng/default.aspx?d=5&dr=901&m=13 |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=[[2006-06-20]] |accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{ru_icon}} [http://mosday.ru/info/article.php?realty-2006 Costs of realty in Moscow (2006)]</ref> A typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square meters, a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square meters, and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square meters. Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in [[dacha]]s (country house) outside the city.

=== Employment ===

As of 2006, there are 8.47 million Muscovites able to work. 1.73 million are employed by the state, 4.42 million are employed by private companies, and 1.99 million are employed by small businesses. There are 74,400 officially registered unemployed working age adults, of which 34,400 are eligible for unemployment benefits.<ref name="mosru-stats" />

== Future development ==
=== Moscow-City ===
[[دوتنه:Federation_Tower1.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Federation Tower]], now being constructed is to be completed in 2007.]]
[[Moscow-City]] or ''Moscow International Business Center'' is a projected part of central Moscow. Geographically situated in [[Presnya]], located at the [[Third Ring]], the Moscow-City area is currently under intense development. 

The goal of MIBC "Moscow-City" is to create the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe, a zone that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. It will be a city within a city. The project was conceived by the Moscow government in 1992.

The construction of MIBC "Moscow-City" takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment.  The whole project takes up 1 square kilometre. This territory is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude.  Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.

At its final stage it will incorporate the highest building in the world, the [[Russia Tower]], an aquapark and other recreational facilities, trade and entertainment complexes, numerous prestigeous office and residential buildings, [[Wedding Palace Tower|Wedding Palace]], the transport node and the [[City Hall and City Duma|new site of the Moscow government]]. A construction of four new metro stations in the territory already completed, of which two opened and two other reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, and besides these, some other stations were planned. A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with [[Sheremetyevo Airport]] is also planned.

The [[Federation Tower]], now being built is to be the completed in 2007, will become the tallest building in Europe when completed.

=== Fourth Transport Ring ===

A fourth ring automobile road (in addition to MKAD, Garden Ring and the Trird Road) is designed and being built in Moscow. It is to be completed by 2012 and will have total length of 61 km.<ref>{{ru_icon}}http://www.gazeta.ru/auto/2006/02/27_a_551381.shtml</ref><ref>{{ru_icon}}http://www.prime-realty.ru/cmi/c5/5.146..htm</ref><ref>[http://www.roads.ru/4tk/4tk_rbk.php Plan of the Fourth Transport Road]</ref>

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:strogino-residental.jpg|right|thumb|right|225px|Residential apartments in [[Strogino]]]] 

The population of Russia has been declining by about 700,000 persons per year since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 due to low birth rates<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prb.org/Template.cfm?Section=PRB&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=6506 |last=Heleniak |first=Timothy |title=Russia's Demographic Decline Continues |month=June |year=2002 |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref> and increase in mortality, and Moscow is not entirely immune to these effects. In 2003, the number of deaths within the city exceeded the number of births by approximately 49,400.<ref name="mdebt-economy">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowdebt.ru/eng/city/memorandum/economy.php |title=Information Memorandum: City Economy |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2006-07-15 |publisher=State Debt Committee of the City of Moscow}}</ref> Birth rates at the onset of the twenty-first century were on the rise, but the average age of the Moscow's population has continued to increase. In 2004, there were more than twice as many Muscovites over 55 years old than there were Muscovites under 14 years old.<ref name="mdebt-economy" /> 
However, large migration numbers still enable the city to overcome the effects of this system. These new Muscovites are attracted by the local economic growth, which contrasts to the stagnation or even decline in most of Russia as a result of sharp polarization of the country in recent years. In order to help regulate the population size within the city, Moscow has an [[internal passport]] system that prohibits non-city residents from staying in the capital for more than ninety days without registration. 

The city is home to small numbers of people of many racial and cultural groups, from African students to Irish business people. In 2002, Moscow's ethnic composition was 84.8% [[Russians|Russian]], 2.4% [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], 1.6% [[Tatars|Tatar]], 1.2% [[Armenians|Armenian]], 0.9% [[Azeris in Russia|Azerbaijani]] 0.8% [[Jew]]ish, 0.6% [[Belarusians|Belarusian]],  0.5% [[Georgian people|Georgian]], and 7.2% other ethnicities.<ref>{{cite paper|url=http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls |title=National Composition of Population for Regions of the Russian Federation |accessdate=2006-07-20 |format=XLS |publisher=2002 Russian All-Population Census |date=2002}}</ref>

=== Real Estate and Neighbourhoods ===
The Moscow [[real estate]] has been increasing a lot the latest years.
Following are some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in order: <br />
[[Patriarch’s Ponds]] is the most expensive and luxurious neighbourhood within the [[Garden Ring]]. The neighbourhood is located in the centre of Moscow, between the [[Boulevard Ring]] and the Garden Ring, but is still pretty quiet. It is also home to a number of embassies that gives the neighbourhood a higher security status. <br />
Another prestigious neighbourhood is [[Arbat]] named after [[Arbat Street]], one of the oldest streets in Moscow and a major tourist attraction with souvenirs, restaurants, art shops and musicians. Arbat is also home to a number of embassies. <br />
[[Kropotkinskaya]] is a prestigious neighbourhood located along the Prechistenka Street and the Moskva River. The neighbourhood is home to the most of the embassies in Moscow. It is also home to the [[Pushkin Art Museum]] and the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]]. <br />
[[Tverskaya Street]] and its surrounding streets like [[Tretyakov Drive]], [[Stoleshnikov Lane]], [[Tverskoy Boulevard]] and the [[Theatre Square]] are home to luxury hotels and expensive boutiques. Tverskaya Street is located next to the Red Square and Kremlin and is the busiest shopping street in Moscow. It is called the main street and has existed since the 12th century. The street is named after [[Tver]], as it’s heading to that direction. <br />
[[Clean Ponds]] is located along the [[Clean Ponds Boulevard]] on the Boulevard Ring. The prestigious neighbourhood is home to many pre-revolutionary buildings, medieval churches, and embassies. <br />
[[Zamoskvorechye]] means beyond the Moskva River. The area is very popular among the [[France|French community]] as the neighbourhood is home to the French embassy. The neighbourhood is also home to the famous [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. <br />
[[Krasnaya Presnya]] is one of the more modern neighbourhoods in Moscow, as it was reconstructed in the 1990s. It is now a more fashionable area than it was before and home to embassies and the [[Moscow Zoo]].

== Crime ==
Sports team fan violence has become a serious problem when international teams play in Moscow. In 2002, a dozen [[Ireland|Irish]] fans in Moscow for a Russia-Ireland game were attacked by [[neo-Nazi]] groups. One later died of his injuries. That same year, when a Russia-[[Japan]] World Cup match, played in Japan but broadcast live to the crowds in [[Pushkin Square]], went badly for the Russians, the crowd turned violent and wrought havoc in the center of the city, breaking windows, smashing and burning cars and looting several shops. Four Japanese students were beaten and more than one hundred people were injured in the violence following the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/story?id=215446&lang=us |date=[[2002-06-09]] |accessdate=2006-07-20 |title=Moscow riots after Japan defeat |last=Bomko |first=Yuri and Gennady Novik |publisher=ESPN Soccer Network}}</ref>

As with many cities in the world, international terrorism is a threat in Moscow. On [[February 6]] [[2004]] a bomb explosion in a subway car near the [[Avtozavodskaya]] [[Moscow metro|metro]] station killed at least 40 and injured many. Other prominent acts of terror include the destruction of two apartment buildings in September 1999 (see [[Russian Apartment Bombings]]), an explosion in the pedestrian subway under the Pushkinskaya square in August 2000, and the [[Moscow Theatre Siege|capture of the theatre at Dubrovka]] in October 2002.
