In [[1980]], the Israeli Knesset confirmed Jerusalem's status as the nation's "eternal and indivisible capital", by passing the ''[[Jerusalem Law|Basic Law: Jerusalem — Capital of Israel]]''. However, the [[United Nations]] disapproved this designation and considers [[Tel Aviv]] as Israel's capital [http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/RES/36/120&Lang=E] . The international community argues that Israel's capture of the eastern half of Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six Day War was in violation of international law, and that the final issue of the status of Jerusalem will be determined in future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Therefore, nearly all countries maintain their embassies in [[Tel Aviv]] [http://cia.gov./cia/publications/factbook/geos/is.html]. See the article on [[Jerusalem]] for more information.</ref>

The '''State of Israel''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Audio|He-Medinat Israel.ogg|{{hbrmem}}{{hbrshva}}{{hbrdalet}}{{hbrhiriqm}}{{hbrnun}}{{hbrpatah}}{{hbrtav}} {{hbryod}}{{hbrhiriq}}{{hbrsin.}}{{hbrshva}}{{hbrresh}}{{hbrqamaz}}{{hbralef}}{{hbrzere}}{{hbrlamed}}}}; ''Medinat Yisra'el''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: دَوْلَةْ إِسْرَائِيل, ''Dawlat Isrā'īl'') is a country in [[Asia]], (specifically the [[Middle East]]), on the eastern edge of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]] and the world's only [[Jewish state]].

== نوم او بېرغ ==
The name "Israel" is rooted in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Tanakh]], where [[Jacob]] is renamed Israel after wrestling with a mysterious adversary ("a man", and later "God" according to [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]] 32:24–30; or "the angel", according to [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] 12:4). ''Israel'' means "he who has wrestled with God". The nation fathered by Jacob, were then called "the children of Israel" or the "Israelites". Nowdays, they are commonly called [[Jew]]s after Jacob's son [[Judah]], the ancient father of the tribe of King [[David]]'s dynasty.

The [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] is rooted in Jewish tradition. The white background symbolizes purity. The symbols on the flag are two stripes—one on the top and one on the bottom—and the [[Star of David]] emblem adorning the center. The stripes and blue color are inspired by the techeileth dye of the [[tallit]] (Jewish prayer shawl).

== تاريخ ==
{{main|History of Israel}}

=== Historical roots ===
{{see also|Kingdom of Israel}}

The earliest known mention of the name 'Israel', probably referring to a group of people rather than to a place, is the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] dated to about 1210 [[Common Era|BCE]]. [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/otarch2.html#merneptah]  For over 3,000 years, [[Jew]]s have held the [[Land of Israel]] to be their homeland, both as a [[Holy Land]] and as a [[Promised Land]].  The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations, encompassing Judaism's most important sites — including the remains of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s, as well as the rites concerning those temples. [http://www.jewfaq.org/israel.htm]  Starting around 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], a series of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Jewish kingdoms and states]] existed intermittently in the region for over a [[millennium]].   [http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mckenzie-david.html]

Under [[Babylonia]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and (briefly) [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] rule, Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions. In particular, the failure of the  [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kochba Revolt]] against the [[Roman Empire]] resulted in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|widescale expulsion of Jews]].  It was during this time that the Romans gave the name [[Syria Palaestina]] to the geographic area, in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land. The [[Mishnah]] and [[Jerusalem Talmud]], two of Judaism's most important religious texts, were composed in the region during this period. The [[Muslim]]s conquered the land from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in 638 [[Common Era|CE]]. The area was ruled by various Muslim states (interrupted by the rule of the [[Crusader states|Crusaders]]) before becoming part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[1517]].

=== Zionism and Aliyah ===
{{Israelis}}
{{main articles|[[Zionism]] and [[Aliyah]]}}

Jews living in the Diaspora have sought to emigrate into Israel throughout the centuries. For example, in 1141 Yehuda Halevi issued a call to the Jews to emigrate to Eretz Israel and eventually died in Jerusalem. In 1267, Nahmanides settled in Jerusalem and since then a continual Jewish presence in Jerusalem has been maintained. Yosef Karo immigrated to the large Jewish community in Safed in 1535. Waves of immigration also occurred, for example in the years 1209-1211, the "aliyah of the Rabbis of France and England" to Acre became famous as in 1258 and 1266. In 1260, Yechiel of Paris emigrated to Acre along with his son and a large group of followers. Small waves of immigration occurred during the 18th century out of religious motives, famously Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and 300 of his followers, Judah he-Hasid and over 1000 disciples, and over five hundred disciples (and their families) of the Vilna Gaon known as Perushim. Waves of rabbinical students immigrated in 1808-1809, settling in Tiberias, Safed and then in Jerusalem.[18] In 1860, the old Jewish community in Jerusalem started building neighborhoods outside the walls of the Old City (the first one being Mishkenot Sha’ananim). In 1878, the first modern agricultural settlement was founded in the form of Petah Tikva.

The first wave of Jewish immigration to Israel, or ''Aliyah'' (עלייה) started in [[1881]] as Jews fled persecution, or followed [[Socialist]] [[Zionism|Zionist]] ideas of [[Moses Hess]] and others of "redemption of the soil". Jews bought land from Ottoman and individual Arab landholders. After Jews established agricultural settlements, tensions erupted between the Jews and Arabs. 

[[Theodor Herzl]] (1860–1904), an [[Austria]]n Jew, founded the [[Zionist movement]]. In [[1896]], he published ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State''), in which he called for the establishment of a national Jewish state. The following year he helped convene the first [[World Zionist Congress]].  

The establishment of Zionism led to the [[Aliyah#Second Aliyah (1904-1914)|Second Aliyah (1904–1914)]] with the influx of around 40,000 Jews. In [[1917]], the British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour|Arthur J. Balfour]] issued the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] that "view[ed] with favour the establishment in [[Palestine]] of a national home for the Jewish people".  In [[1920]], Palestine became a [[League of Nations]] [[British Mandate of Palestine|mandate administered by Britain]].

Jewish immigration resumed in [[Aliyah#Third Aliyah (1919-1923)|third (1919–1923)]] and [[Aliyah#Fourth Aliyah (1924-1929)|fourth (1924–1929)]] waves after [[World War I]]. Arab [[riots in Palestine of 1929]] killed 133 Jews, including 67 in [[Hebron]]. 

The rise of [[Nazism]] in [[1933]] led to a [[Aliyah#Fifth Aliyah (1929-1939)|fifth wave of Aliyah]]. The Jews in the region increased from 83,790 (11%) in 1922 to 608,230 (33%) by 1940. The subsequent [[Holocaust]] in Europe led to [[Aliyah#Aliyah Bet: Illegal immigration (1933-1948)|additional immigration]] from other parts of Europe. By the end of [[World War II]], the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.

In [[1939]], the British introduced a [[White Paper of 1939]], which limited Jewish immigration over the course of the war to 75,000 and restricted purchase of land by Jews, perhaps in response to the [[Great Arab Uprising]] (1936-1939). The White Paper was seen as a betrayal by the Jewish community and Zionists, who perceived it as being in conflict with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]].  The Arabs were not entirely satisfied either, as they wanted Jewish immigration halted completely.  However, the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate.  <!--
 As a result, many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the [[Holocaust]] were intercepted and returned to Europe.  Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships ''[[Struma]]'' and ''[[Exodus (ship)|Exodus]]''.[http://www.israeltoday.co.il/Default.aspx?tabid=139&view=item&idx=726] These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as [[Aliya Beth]]. -->

=== Jewish Underground Groups ===
{{main|British Mandate of Palestine}}
As tensions grew between the Jewish and Arab populations, and with apparently no support from the British Mandate authorities, the Jewish community realized it would have to rely on itself for self-defense.

As a result of the 1921 Arab attacks, the [[Haganah]] was formed to protect Jewish settlements.
The Haganah was mostly defensive in nature, which among other things caused several members to split off and form the [[Irgun]] (initially known as Hagana Beth) in 1931. The Irgun adhered to a much more active approach, both in retaliation to attacks and initiation of armed actions against the British, while the Haganah often preferred restraint. A further split occurred when [[Avraham Stern]] left the Irgun to form [[Lehi]], which unlike the Irgun refused any co-operation with the British, even during [[World War II]], and was much more extreme in its methods.

These groups had an enormous impact on events in the period preceding the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], such as [[Aliya Beth]]-the clandestine immigration from Europe, the forming of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and the withdrawal of the British, as well as to a great degree forming the foundation of the [[Politics of Israel|political parties]] which exist in Israel today.

=== Establishment of the State ===
[[دوتنه:Declaration of State of Israel 1948.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[David Ben Gurion|Ben Gurion]] pronounces the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, May 14, 1948|Declaration of the State of Israel]] on [[May 14]] [[1948]] in [[Tel Aviv]].]]
{{main|Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel}}

In [[1947]], following increasing levels of violence by Jewish militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations, the British government decided to withdraw from the [[Palestine Mandate]]. The [[UN General Assembly]] approved the [[1947 UN Partition Plan]] dividing the territory into two states, Jewish and Arab.  The Jewish area having roughly 55% of the land, and Arab roughly 45%. [[Jerusalem]] was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status. 

Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly (on [[November 29]], [[1947]]), [[David Ben-Gurion]] tentatively accepted the partition, while the Arab League rejected it. Several Arab attacks on Jewish civilians soon turned into widespread fighting between Arabs and Jews, this civil war being the first "phase" of the 1948 war of Independence.

On [[May 14]] [[1948]], before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at [[midnight]] of [[May 15]] [[1948]], the State of Israel was proclaimed.

=== War of Independence and migration ===
{{main|1948 Arab-Israeli War}}

The surrounding Arab states supported the Palestinian Arabs in rejecting both the Partition Plan and the establishment of Israel, and the armies of five Arab nations (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebannon and Iraq) attacked the newly formed State of Israel. Over the next 15 months, Israelis captured and annexed an additional 26% of the Mandate territory west of the [[Jordan river]]. Most of the Arab population fled before or during the war due to encouragement by the surrounding Arab governments. (Estimates of the final refugee count range from 600,000 to 900,000 with the official United Nations count at 711,000.<ref>[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883!OpenDocument General Progress Report and Supplementary Report of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, Covering the Period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950], published by the [[United Nations Concilation Commission]], [[October 23]], [[1950]]. (U.N. General Assembly Official Records, 5th Session, Supplement No. 18, Document A/1367/Rev. 1) The Committee believed the estimate to be "as accurate as circumstances permit", and attributed the higher number on relief to, among other things, "duplication of ration cards, addition of persons who have been displaced from area other than Israel-held areas and of persons who, although not displaced, are destitute."</ref>) The continuing conflict between Israel and the Arab world resulted in a lasting displacement that persists to this day.

Immigration of Holocaust survivors and Jewish refugees from Arab lands doubled Israel's population within a year of independence. Over the following decade approximately 600,000 [[Mizrahi Jew]]s, who [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|fled or were expelled from surrounding Arab countries]] and Iran, migrated to Israel (with another 300,000 or so settling in [[France]] and [[North America]], leaving only a tiny remnant, mostly in [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]). Israel's Jewish population continued to grow at a very high rate for some years, and was fed by further waves of [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] following the collapse of the [[USSR]].
{{see also|Jewish refugees|Palestinian refugee|Palestinian exodus}}

=== Subsequent wars, negotiations and agreements ===

{{Main|Arab-Israeli conflict}}
After 1948, conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors continued, sometimes escalating to full-scale wars. Israel and its neighboring countries fought out the [[1956 Suez War]], [[1967 Six Day War]], [[1970 War of Attrition]], and [[1973 Yom Kippur War]]. The state of war between Egypt and Israel ended with the signing of the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]] on [[March 26]], [[1979]]. The state of war with [[Jordan]] officially ended with the signing of the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]] on [[October 26]] [[1994]]. Sporadic negotiations with [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] have not as yet resulted in peace treaties. On [[May 25]] [[2000]], Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982.


Israel is currently also embroiled in an [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|ongoing conflict]] with [[Palestinians]] in the territories controlled since the [[Six Day War]] in [[1967]], despite the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] on [[September 13]] [[1993]], and the ongoing efforts of Israeli, Palestinian and global peacemakers. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on [[September 13]] [[1993]] a Declaration of Principles (also known as the "Oslo accords") guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule, as well as avoiding any act of violence and inciting for violence, especially violence aimed at innocent people.  

In keeping with the framework established at the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Conference in October 1991]], bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement. On [[24 June]] [[2002]], US President [[George W. Bush]] reaffirmed "the road map" for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which envisions a two-state solution. However, progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by Palestinian-Israeli violence between September 2000 and February 2005. Major warfare between Israel and Palestinian organizations took place in the [[1982 Lebanon War]], [[1987 First Intifada]] and the [[2000 al-Aqsa Intifada]]. 

An agreement reached at Sharm al-Sheikh in February 2005 significantly reduced the violence. The election in January 2005 of [[Mahmud Abbas]] as the new Palestinian leader following the November 2004 death of [[Yasser Arafat]], the formation of a Likud-Labor-United Torah Judaism coalition government in January 2005, and the successful Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip (August-September 2005), presented an opportunity for a renewed peace effort. However, internal Israeli political events between October and December 2005 have destabilized the political situation and forced early elections, scheduled for March 2006.

[[دوتنه:Israel_topo_en.jpg|thumb|250px|Relief map of this country]]
{{main|Geography of Israel}}
Israel is bordered  by [[لېبنان]] in the north, [[سوريه]], [[اردن]] and the [[West Bank]] in the east, and [[مصر]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] in the south-west. It has [[coastal|coastlines]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in the west and the [[Headlands and bays|Gulf]] of [[Eilat]] (also known as the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]) in the south. 

During the [[Six-Day War]] of [[1967]], Israel captured the West Bank from the Hashemite Kingdom of [[اردن]], the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria, Gaza Strip (which was under Egyptian occupation), and [[Sinai]] from [[مصر]]. It [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|withdrew]] all [[Israeli Security Forces|troops]] and [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] from the Gaza Strip on [[September 12]] [[2005]]. The future [[Palestine (region)#Current status|status]] of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights remains to be determined. 


The total area of the sovereign territory of Israel — excluding all territories captured by Israel in [[1967]] — is 20,770 km²  or 8,019 [[square mile|mi²]]; of that about one per cent  of it is water.  The total area under Israeli law — including [[East Jerusalem]] and the [[Golan Heights]] — is 22,145 km²  or 8,550 mi²; with a little less than one per cent being water.  The total area under Israeli control — including the military-controlled and [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian]]-governed territory of the [[West Bank]] — is 28,023 km² or 10,820 mi² (~1% water).

=== Metropolitan areas ===
{{see also|Districts of Israel|List of cities in Israel}}
As of 2004, The Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics defines three metropolitan areas: [[Gush Dan|Tel Aviv]] (population 2,933,300), [[Haifa]] (population 980,600) and [[Beersheba|Be'er Sheva]] (population 511,700) [http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton55/st02_15.pdf]. [[Jerusalem]]{{ref|Jerusalem}} may also be considered a metropolitan area, though its limits are hard to define since it spans communities in Israel proper and the [[West Bank]], both Israeli and Palestinian, and even the boundaries of Jerusalem city itself are disputed. As of 2005, the official population of Jerusalem city is 706,368.

== Politics and law ==
{{main|Politics of Israel}}

Israel is a democratic [[republic]] with [[universal suffrage]] that operates under the [[parliamentary system]]. 

=== Legislature ===
Israel's [[unicameral]] legislative branch is a 120-member [[parliament]] known as the [[Knesset]]. Membership in the Knesset is allocated to parties based on their proportion of the vote, via a [[proportional representation]] voting system. Elections to the [[Knesset]] are normally held every four years, but the Knesset can decide to dissolve itself ahead of time by a simple majority, known as a vote of no-confidence.
{{See also|List of political parties in Israel}}

=== Executive ===
The [[President of Israel]] is [[head of state]], serving as a largely ceremonial [[figurehead]]. The President selects the leader of the majority party or ruling coalition in the Knesset as the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], who serves as [[head of government]].<ref>For a short period in the [[1990s]] the Prime Minister was directly elected by the electorate. This change was not viewed a success and was abandoned.</ref>

=== Constitution and legal system ===
[[دوتنه:Knesset in Jerusalem Israel.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Knesset]] building, Israel's parliament]]

Israel has not completed a written [[constitution]]. Its government is based on the laws of the [[Knesset]], especially the "[[Basic Laws of Israel]]", which are special laws (currently there are 15 of them), by the Knesset legislature which will become the future official constitution. In mid-2003, the Knesset's Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee began [http://www.cfisrael.org drafting a full written Constitution to be proposed to the Knesset floor.] This effort is still underway as of early [[2006]].

The [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, May 14, 1948|declaration of the State of Israel]] has a significance in this matter as well. Israel's legal system is a western legal system best classified as "mixed": influenced by Anglo-American, Continental, and Jewish law principles. 

As in Anglo-American law, the Israeli legal system is based on the principle of ''stare-decisis'' (precedent).  It is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial one, in the sense that the parties (for example, plaintiff and defendant) are the ones that bring the evidence before the court. The court does not conduct any independent investigation on the case. 

As in Continental legal systems, the [[jury]] system was not adopted in Israel. Court cases are decided by professional [[judge]]s. 

As for Civil Law influences, several major Israeli statutes (such as the Contract Law) are based on Civil Law principles. Israeli statute body is not comprised of Codes, but of individual statutes. However, a Civil Code draft has been completed recently, and is planned to become a bill.

Religious tribunals (Jewish, Sharia'a, Druze and Christian) have exclusive jurisdiction on annulment of marriages.

=== Judiciary ===
[[دوتنه:SupremeCourtIsrael ST 06.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Frontal view of [[Supreme Court of Israel|The Supreme Court]] building]]
Israel's Judiciary branch is made of a three-tier system of courts.  At the lowest level are Magistrate Courts, situated in most cities. Above them are District Courts, serving both as [[appellate court]]s and as courts of first instance, situated in five cities: [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]], [[Beersheba]] and [[Nazareth]].

At the top of the judicial pyramid is the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] seated in Jerusalem.  The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is [[Aharon Barak]]. The Supreme Court serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and as the body for a separate institution known as the High Court of Justice (HCOJ). The HCOJ has the unique responsibility of addressing petitions presented to the Court by individual citizens. The respondents to these petitions are usually Governmental agencies (including the Israel Defense Forces). The result of such petitions, which are decided by the HCOJ, may be an instruction by the HCOJ to the relevant Governmental agency to act in a manner prescribed by the HCOJ.

Judges are elected by a committee made of Members of the Knesset (Parliament), Supreme Court Justices, and Members of the Israeli Bar.  According to the Courts Law, judges retire at age 70. Registrars to all courts are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, with the approval of the Minister of Justice.

== Military ==
{{main|Israeli Security Forces}}

Israel's military consists of a unified [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by the acronym ''Tzahal'' (צה"ל). Historically, there have been no separate Israeli military services. The Navy and [[Israeli Air Force|Air Force]] are subordinate to the Army. There are other paramilitary government agencies which deal with different aspects of Israel's security (such as ''[[Israel Border Police|Magav]]'' and ''[[Shin Bet]]''). 

The IDF is considered one of the strongest military forces in the [[Middle East]] and ranks among the most battle-trained armed forces in the world, having had to defend the country in five major wars. The IDF's main resource is the training quality of its soldiers and expert institutions, rather than use of overwhelming force. It also relies heavily on high-tech weapons systems, some developed and manufactured in Israelhjggfgv hgn  hv gb ggjgf  for its specific needs, and others imported (largely from the United States). 

Most Israelis (males and females) are [[conscription|drafted]] into the military at age 18. Exceptions are [[Israeli Arab]]s, confirmed [[pacifists]], those who cannot serve due to injury or disability, and women who declare themselves religiously observant. Compulsory service is three years for men, and two years for women. [[Circassians]] and [[Bedouin]] actively enlist in the IDF. Since [[1956]], [[Druze]] men have been conscripted in the same way as Jewish men, at the request of the Druze community. Men studying full-time in religious institutions can get a deferment from conscription. Most [[Haredi Judaism|''Haredi'' Jews]] extend these deferments until they are too old to be conscripted, a practice that has fueled much controversy in Israel. 

Following compulsory service, Israeli men become part of the IDF reserve forces, and are usually required to serve several weeks every year as reservists until their 40s.

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] believes Israel to be a state possessing nuclear weapons.  The government has never confirmed nor denied this assertion. Israel has not ratified the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. (See [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction]].)

== Economy ==
[[دوتنه:Natbag2000 from-the-air.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ben Gurion Airport]] is an important hub for [[international trade]] and [[tourism]]]]
{{main|Economy of Israel}}
Israel has a technologically advanced market economy with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of [[fossil fuels]] ([[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], and [[coal]]), [[grains]], [[beef]], raw materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains and beef. Diamonds, high-technology, military equipment, software, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables and flowers) are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable [[current account deficit]]s, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Israel possesses extensive facilities for [[oil refining]], [[diamond#The diamond industry|diamond polishing]], and [[semiconductor]] fabrication.

Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the [[United States]], which is its major source of economic and military aid. A relatively large fraction of Israel's external debt is held by [[individual investor]]s, via the [[Israel Bonds]] program. The combination of American loan guarantees and direct sales to individual investors, allow the state to borrow at competitive and sometimes below-market rates.

The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former [[USSR]] topped 750,000 during the period [[1989]]–[[1999]], bringing the population of Israel from the former [[Soviet Union]] to one million, one-sixth of the total population, and adding scientific and professional expertise of substantial value for the economy's future. The influx, coupled with the opening of new markets at the end of the [[Cold War]], energized Israel's economy, which grew rapidly in the early [[1990s]]. But growth began slowing in [[1996]] when the government imposed tighter fiscal and monetary policies and the immigration bonus petered out. Those policies brought inflation down to record low levels in [[1999]].

High technology industries have taken a pre-eminent role in the economy, particularly in the last decade. Israel’s limited natural resources and strong emphasis on education have also played key roles in directing industry towards high technology fields. As a result of the country’s success in developing cutting edge technologies in software, communications and the life sciences, Israel is frequently referred to as a second Silicon Valley. Israel (as of 2004) receives more venture capital investment than any country in Europe, and has the largest VC/GDP rate in the world, seven times that of the United States.

Another leading industry is [[Tourism in Israel|tourism]], which benefits from the plethora of important historical sites for Judaism and Christianity and from Israel’s warm climate and access to water resources. The diamond industry is also of importance, but it has been impacted by changing industry conditions and shifts of certain industry activities to the Far East. 

As Israel has liberalized its economy and reduced taxes and spending, the gap between the rich and poor has grown.  As of 2005, 20.5% of Israeli families (and 34% of Israeli children) are living below the poverty line, though around 40% of those are lifted above the poverty line through transfer payments.

Israel's GDP per capita, as of [[28 July]], [[2005]], was $20,551.20 per person (42nd in the world). Israel's overall productivity was $54,510.40, and the amount of patents granted was 74/1,000,000 people.

{{main|Demographics of Israel}}
According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, at the end of [[2004]], of Israel's 6.9 million people, 76.2% were [[Jew]]s, 19.5%  [[Arab]]s, and 4.3% "others".[http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton56/st02_01.pdf]

Among Jews, 68% were [[Sabra (person)|Sabras]] (Israeli-born), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest are [[oleh|olim]] — 22% from [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], and 10% from [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], including the [[Arab world|Arab countries]].[http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton56/st02_24.pdf]

Israel has two official languages; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (''See also:'' [[Languages of Israel]]). Hebrew is the major and primary language of the state and is spoken by the majority of the population. Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority and by some members of the [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Teimani]] Jewish communities.  [[English language|English]] is studied in school and is spoken by the majority of the population as a second language. Other languages spoken in Israel include [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[French language|French]]. American and European popular television shows are commonly presented. Newspapers can be found in all languages listed above as well as others, such as [[Persian language|Farsi]].

As of [[2004]], 224,200 Israeli citizens lived in the [[West Bank]] in numerous [[Israeli settlement]]s, (including towns such as [[Ma'ale Adummim]] and [[Ariel, West Bank|Ariel]], and a handful of communities that were present long before the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and were re-established after the [[Six-Day War]] such as [[Hebron]] and [[Gush Etzion]]). Around 180,000 Israelis lived in [[East Jerusalem]] [http://fmep.org/settlement_info/stats_data/jerusalem/east_jerusalem_population_area_2000-2002.html], which came under Israeli law following its capture from Jordan during the Six-Day War. About 8,500 Israelis lived in settlements built in the [[Gaza Strip]], prior to their forcible removal by the government in the summer of [[2005]] as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]].

[[دوتنه:Israel 1 027.Young male religious Jews.jpg|thumb|250px|Young [[Haredi]] men in [[Jerusalem]].]]
According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, at the end of 2004, 76.2% of Israelis were [[Judaism|Jews]] by religion,  16.1% were [[Muslims]], 2.1% [[Christian]], 1.6% [[Druze]] and the remaining 3.9% (including [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants and some [[Jews]]) were not classified by religion.[http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton56/st02_01.pdf] 

Roughly 6% of Israeli Jews define themselves as ''[[haredi]]m'' (ultra-orthodox religious); an additional 9% are "religious"; 34% consider themselves "traditionalists" (not strictly adhering to Jewish [[Halakha]]); and 51% are "secular" (termed "hiloni"). Among the seculars, 53% believe in God.

Israelis tend not to align themselves with a movement of [[Judaism]] (such as [[Reform Judaism]] or [[Conservative Judaism]]) but instead tend to define their religious affiliation by degree of their religious practice.

Among [[Israeli Arabs|Arab Israelis]], 82.6% were Muslim, 8.8% were [[Christian]] and 8.4% were [[Druze]].[http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton56/st02_01.pdf]
