Sher Ali Khan (1825–February 21, 1879) was the Emir of Afghanistan from 1863 to 1866 and from 1868 until his death. He was the third son of Dost Mohammed Khan, who founded the Barakzai Dynasty.

Sher Ali initially seized power when his father died, but was quickly ousted by his older brother, Mohammed Afzal Khan. Internecine warfare followed until Sher Ali defeated his brother and regained the title of Emir. His rule was hindered by pressure from both Britain and Russia though Sher Ali attempted to keep Afghanistan neutral in their conflict. In 1878, the neutrality fell apart and the Second Anglo-Afghan War erupted. As British forces marched on Kabul, Sher Ali attempted to flee the capital. He died during his escape, leaving the throne to his son Mohammad Yaqub Khan.
