[[Image:Www.wikipedia.org screenshot.png|thumb|wikipedia.org]]
'''Wikipedia''' ([[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ˌwikiˈpiːdi.ə/}} or {{IPA|/ˌwɪkiˈpiːdi.ə/}}) is a [[multilingual]], [[World Wide Web|web-based]], [[free content]] [[encyclopedia]] project. Wikipedia is [[Collaborative writing|written collaboratively]] by [[volunteer]]s from all around the world. With rare exceptions, its articles can be [[Help:Editing|edited]] by anyone with access to the [[Internet]], simply by clicking the ''edit this page'' link. The name Wikipedia is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[wiki]]'' (a type of collaborative website) and ''[[encyclopedia]]''. Since its creation in 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference Web sites on the Internet.

In every article, links will guide you to associated articles, often with additional information. You are welcome to add further information, cross-references, or citations, so long as you do so within Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|editing policies]] and to an appropriate standard. You do not need to fear accidentally damaging Wikipedia when you add or improve information, as [[Wikipedia:Who writes Wikipedia|other editors]] are always around to advise or correct obvious errors, if needed, and the Wikipedia encyclopedia software, known as [[MediaWiki]], is carefully designed to allow easy reversal of editorial mistakes.

Because Wikipedia is an ongoing work to which in principle anybody can contribute, it differs from a paper-based reference source in some very important ways. In particular, older articles tend to be more comprehensive and balanced, while newer articles may still contain significant misinformation, unencyclopedic content, or [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]. Users need to be aware of this in order to obtain valid information and avoid misinformation which has been recently added and not yet removed. (See ''[[Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia|Researching with Wikipedia]]'' for more details.) However, unlike a paper reference source, Wikipedia can be constantly updated, with articles on topical events being created or updated within minutes or hours, rather than months or years for printed encyclopedias.

[[Wikipedia]] is a registered [[trademark]] of the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which has created an entire family of free content [[m:Complete list of Wikimedia projects|projects]]. On all these projects, you are welcome to [[WP:BB|be bold]] and edit articles yourself, contributing knowledge as you see fit in a collaborative way.

If you have not done so, we invite you to take a few moments to read [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is (and is not)]], so that you have an understanding of how to use, rely upon, or contribute to Wikipedia as you continue. Further information on key topics can be found below. If you can't find what you are looking for, try the '''[[Wikipedia:FAQ|Frequently Asked Questions]]''' or see '''[[Wikipedia:Questions|Where to ask questions]]'''. For help with editing and other issues, see ''[[Help:Contents]]''.

===د ويکيپېډيا تاريخ===
{{details|History of Wikipedia}}
Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of [[Nupedia]], a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia. Nupedia had an elaborate system of [[peer review]] and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was seen as very slow. During [[2000]], [[Jimmy Wales]], founder of Nupedia, and [[Larry Sanger]], whom Wales had employed to work on the project, discussed various ways to supplement Nupedia with a more open, complementary project.

On the evening of [[January 2]], [[2001]], Sanger had a conversation over dinner with [[WikiWikiWeb:BenKovitz|Ben Kovitz]], a [[computer programmer]], in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]]. Kovitz, who was a regular on "[[Ward Cunningham|Ward's]] Wiki" (the [[WikiWikiWeb]]), explained the [[wiki]] concept to Sanger. Sanger saw that a wiki would be an excellent format whereby a more open, less formal encyclopedia project could be pursued. Sanger easily persuaded Wales, who had been introduced to the wiki concept previously, to set up a wiki for Nupedia, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on [[January 10]].

There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki format, however, so the new project was given the name "Wikipedia" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on [[January 15]] (now humorously called "[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Day|Wikipedia Day]]" by some users). The [[bandwidth]] and [[server (computing)|server]] (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past [[Bomis]] employees who have done some work on the encyclopedia include [[Tim Shell]], one of the co-founders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey. The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the nonprofit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] was launched as its new parent organization, prompting the use of a .org domain to denote its noncommercial nature.
In March 2007 the word ''wiki'' became a newly recognised English word.<ref>http://www.oed.com/help/updates/Prakrit-prim.html</ref>

In [[May 2001]], the first wave of non-English Wikipedias were launched in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Esperanto]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], soon joined by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Announcements_May_2001 |title=Wikipedia announcements - May 2001}}</ref> In September,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Announcements_September_2001 |title=Wikipedia announcements - September2001}}</ref> a further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made. At the end of the year, [[Afrikaans]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Serbocroatian language|Serbocroatian]] versions were announced.

===د ويکيپېډيا شمار===
:''Main articles: [[Wikipedia:Statistics]], [[Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia]]''
There are over [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediansEditsGt5.htm 75,000 active contributors] working on more than [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesArticlesTotal.htm 5,300,000 articles] in more than [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/Sitemap.htm 100 languages]. As of today, there are {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} articles in [[English language|English]]; every day [http://www.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesUsageVisits.htm hundreds of thousands] of visitors from around the world make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to enhance the amount of knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia. Visitors do not need any specialised qualifications to contribute, since their primary role is to write articles that cover already-existing knowledge, and people of all ages therefore can [[Wikipedia:Who writes Wikipedia|write Wikipedia articles]].

All the text in Wikipedia, and most of the images and other content, is covered by the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL). Contributions remain the property of their creators, while the GFDL license ensures the content will remain freely distributable and reproducible (see the [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright notice]] and the [[Wikipedia:Content disclaimer|content disclaimer]] for more information)

===څوک دي چې ويکيپېډيا ليکي؟===
{{main|Wikipedia:Who writes Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Wikipedians}}
There are tens of thousands of regular editors - everyone from expert scholars to casual readers. Anyone who visits the site can edit it, and this fact has encouraged contribution of a tremendous amount of content. There are mechanisms that help community members watch for bad edits, over one thousand administrators with special powers to enforce good behavior, and a judicial committee which considers the few situations remaining unresolved, and decides on withdrawal or restriction of editing privileges or other punishments when needed, after all other consensus remedies have been tried. The site is owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which is largely uninvolved in daily operation and writing!

==Making the best use of Wikipedia==
===Exploring Wikipedia===
{{main|Wikipedia:Explore}}
Many visitors come to this site to acquire knowledge, others to share knowledge. In fact, at this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and [[Special:Newpages|new articles]] are also being created. You can view the changes at the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent changes]] page. You also can view [[Special:Randompage|random articles]]. Over 1,200 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]], exemplifying the best articles in Wikipedia. Another 1,800 articles are designated as [[Wikipedia:Good articles|good articles]]. Wikipedia also has [[Portal:List of portals|portals]], which organize content around topic areas. You may also [[Wikipedia:Searching|search]] for articles, using the search box on the left side of the screen.

You also might enjoy reading Wikipedia in other languages. Wikipedia has more than two hundred different languages (see [[#Wikipedia versions in other languages|other language versions]]), including a [http://simple.wikipedia.org Simple English] version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service (see [[#Sister projects|sister projects]]). All of these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include thought-provoking information and articles which can be hard to find through other common sources.

===Basic navigation in Wikipedia===
{{main|Wikipedia:Basic navigation}}
Wikipedia articles are all [[Hyperlink|linked]], or cross-referenced. Wherever you see highlighted text like [[wikilink|this]], it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere if you need it. Holding your mouse over the link will often show you where a link will take you. You are always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached. There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external web sites and pages, reference material, and [[Wikipedia:Category|organized categories of knowledge]] which you can search and traverse in a loose [[hierarchy]] for more information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our [[Wikipedia:Sister projects|sister projects]]. You can add further links if a relevant link is missing, and this is one way to contribute.

===Using Wikipedia as a research tool===
{{main|Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia|Citing Wikipedia}}
As a [[wiki]], articles are never complete. They are continually edited and improved over time, and in general this results in an upward trend of quality, and a growing consensus over a fair and balanced representation of information.

Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start. Indeed, many articles start their lives as partisan, and it is after a long process of discussion, debate and argument, that they gradually take on a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] reached through [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]]. Others may for a while become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time - months perhaps - to extricate themselves and regain a better balanced consensus. In part, this is because Wikipedia operates an internal resolution process when editors cannot agree on content and approach, and such issues take time to come to the attention of more experienced editors.

The ''ideal'' Wikipedia article is balanced, [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] and encyclopedic, containing notable, [[WP:A|verifiable]] knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. However this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved, as each user adds their contribution in turn. Some articles contain statements and claims which have not yet been fully [[WP:CITE|cited]]. Others will later have entire new sections added. Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded, and may be removed or expounded.

While the overall trend is generally upward, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in standard and maturity. There [[Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia|are guidelines and information pages]] designed to help users and researchers do this effectively, and an article that summarizes third party studies and assessments of the [[reliability of Wikipedia]].

===How is Wikipedia different from a paper encyclopedia?===
:''Main article: [[m:Wiki is not paper|Wiki is not paper]] (on [[m:|Wikimedia Meta-Wiki]])''
The most major area of difference between Wikipedia and a traditional paper encyclopedia include the very low "cost" of adding additional articles or information, or expanding existing material; the ability to provide both overview summaries and extensive detail without becoming hard to read; ease of reading due to [[wikilink]]s replacing in line explanations; timeliness accessibility and ease of editing in the editorial cycle; and low environmental cost (no paper or distribution impact on the environment).

===Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia===
{{main|Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is so great|Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is not so great}}
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses and differences arise because it is open to anyone, has a large contributor base, and articles are written by consensus according to editorial guidelines and policies. The [[MediaWiki]] software which runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes", and is never "lost" or deleted.

Wikipedia is '''open to a large contributor base''', drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications, and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and impose bias. A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented. A large number of editors contributing at any moment also means that Wikipedia can produce excellent encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence.

Wikipedia articles and coverage of topics may have a tendency to reflect the cultural, age, and socio-economic demographics of its contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure that [[Wikipedia:List of articles all languages should have|"obviously important" topics]] are written about, so Wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions. While ''most'' articles may be altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor, Christian or Jewish rather than Muslim or Buddhist etc.) and will thus necessarily reflect a certain degree of implicit bias. Some more academic topics may not be covered as well on Wikipedia, while pop culture topics are covered in great depth.

Allowing '''anyone to edit''' Wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information later needing removal. While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle vandalism and viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work. While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling, or less well monitored, articles may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies]], or may add information without [[WP:CITE|citable]] sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] and edits to articles on their [[Wikipedia:Watchlist|watchlist]].

Wikipedia is '''written by consensus''' -- an approach that has its pros and cons. Censorship or imposing "official" points of view is difficult to achieve and almost always fails after a time. Eventually for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be a long and drawn-out, with articles more fluid or changeable for a long time compared while they find their "neutral approach" that all sides can agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by [[Wikipedia:Tendentious editing|extreme-viewpoint contributors]]. Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but also permits months-long disagreements before poor quality or biased edits will be removed forcibly.

Studies suggest that Wikipedia is broadly as reliable as ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'', with similar error rates on established articles for both major and minor omissions and errors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/projects/history_flow/results.htm |title=history flow: results |work=IBM}}</ref> There is a tentative consensus, backed by a gradual increase in [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia as an academic source|academic citation as a source]], that it provides a good starting point for research, and that articles in general have proven to be reasonably sound. That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and whilst misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example [[John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy|this incident]] in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for 4 months, saying afterwards he "didn’t know [[Wikipedia]] was used as a serious reference tool.") Therefore, a common conclusion is that it is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects, but like any online source, unfamiliar information should be checked before relying upon it.

A [[2005]] editorial by a [[BBC]] [[technology]] writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of new [[cultural learning]]s which are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media), namely "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm What is it with Wikipedia?] 16 December 2005.</ref>

:{{seealso|Reliability of Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia}}

===Disclaimers===
{{Disclaimers}}
:''Main article and text of disclaimers: [[Wikipedia:Disclaimers]]. <br />Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia.''
Wikipedia, in common with many websites, makes its disclaimers highly visible, a practice which at times has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable. A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable (including sources such as [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], [[Associated Press]], and the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) can be read and compared at [[Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers|Non-Wikipedia disclaimers]]. Wikipedia content advisories can also be found [[:template:UWAYOR|here]].

==Contributing to Wikipedia==
:''Main articles: [[Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia|Contributing to Wikipedia]], [[Wikipedia:First steps|First steps in editing articles]], [[Wikipedia:Bootcamp|Bootcamp]]''
:''Guide to fixing vandalism: [[Help:Reverting]]''

Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the ''Edit this page'' tab in an article. Before beginning to contribute however, you should check out some handy helping tools such as the [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|tutorial]] and the [[Wikipedia:policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]], as well as [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|our welcome page]]. It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be [[WP:CIVILITY|civil]] and [[WP:NPOV|neutral]], respecting all points of view, and only add [[WP:V|verifiable]] and factual information rather than [[WP:NOR|personal views and opinions]]. "[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]" cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing. However, repeated vandalizing will be reported via the [[WP:AIV|Administrator Notice Board]] and the user may be temporarily [[WP:BLOCK|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia.

Most articles start as [[WP:STUB|stubs]], but after many contributions, they can become [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]]. Once you have determined that there is no article on Wikipedia on a topic you are interested in, you may want to [[Wikipedia:Requested articles|request that the article]] be written (or you could even research the issue and write it yourself). Wikipedia has many on-going [[Wikipedia:WikiProject|projects]], focused on specific topic areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing. The hope of any contributor is to provide useful and accurate information to others, and the projects help coordinate efforts.

===د ويکيپېډيا د مخونو سمادول===
:''Main article, including list of common mark-up shortcuts: [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page]]''

Wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page [[markup language|layout]] to allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page design. These include automatic sections and subsections, automatic references and cross-references, image and table inclusion, indented and listed text, links ISBNs and math, as well as usual formatting elements and most world alphabets and common symbols. Most of these have simple formats that are deliberately very easy and intuitive.

Wikipedia has robust [[revision control|version and reversion controls]]. This means that poor quality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editors, so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing. As there are many more editors intent upon good quality articles than any other kind, articles that are poorly edited are usually corrected rapidly.

===Wikipedia content criteria===
{{Main|Wikipedia:Wikipedia in nine words}}
Wikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with external sources, and neutrally presented, with external sources cited.

The appropriate policies and guidelines for these are found at:
# [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] summarizes what Wikipedia is, and what it is not.
# [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] Wikipedia's core approach, neutral unbiased article writing.
# [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] what is valid information, and what counts as a reliable source.
# [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]] sources should be cited, and the manner of doing so.
These can be abbreviated to [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|WP:NOT]], [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:CITE]] respectively.

===Editorial administration, oversight and management===
{{main|Wikipedia:Editorial oversight and control}}
The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role they may choose, subject to peer approval. Individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others request, watching current edits for vandalism, or watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or similar roles. Editors who find that editorial administrator responsibility would benefit their ability to help the community may ask their peers in the community for agreement to undertake such roles; a structure which enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct. At present around a 75-80% approval rating after enquiry, is considered the requirement for such a role, a standard which tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust and familiarity across a broad front of projects within Wikipedia.

A variety of [[:Category:Wikipedia counter-vandalism tools|software assisted systems]] and [[Wikipedia:Bots|automated programs]] help several hundred editors to watch for problematic edits and editors. An [[Wikipedia:Arbitration committee|arbitration committee]] sits at the top of all editorial and editor conduct disputes,<ref>The founder of Wikipedia is the sole individual empowered to override this process, but has stated in public that extreme circumstances aside, he will not do so.</ref> and its members are elected in three regularly rotated [[tranche]]s by an established enquiry and decision making process in which all regular editors can equally participate.

===Handling disputes and abuse===
:''Main articles: [[Wikipedia:Vandalism]], [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution]], [[Wikipedia:Consensus]], [[Wikipedia:Sock puppet]], [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]]''
Wikipedia has a rich span of methods to handle most abuses which commonly arise, which are well tested and should be relied upon.
* Intentional ''[[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]'' can be [[WP:AIV|reported]] and corrected by anyone.
* Unresolved ''disputes'' between editors, whether based upon behavior, editorial approach or validity of content, can be addressed through the [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk page]] of an article, through [[Wikipedia:Request for comments|requesting comments from other editors]] or through Wikipedia's comprehensive [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution|dispute resolution]] process.
* ''Abuse of user accounts'', such as the creation of [[Internet sock puppet]]s or solicitation of friends and other parties to enforce a non-neutral viewpoint or [[Wikipedia:consensus|inappropriate consensus]] within a discussion, or to disrupt other Wikipedia processes in an annoying manner, are addressed through the [[Wikipedia:Sock puppet|sock puppet policy]].
In addition, ''brand new users'' (until they have established themselves a bit) may at the start find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal [[Wikipedia:Polls are evil|polls]], in order to prevent abuse of [[Wikipedia:Single purpose account|single purpose accounts]].

===Editorial quality review===
As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual, and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement. Examples of the processes involved include [[Wikipedia:Peer review|peer review]], [[Wikipedia:Good articles|good article assessment]], and [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]], a rigorous review of articles which are desired to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high quality work.

In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory|projects]], assessment processes (such as [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Assessment|biographical article assessment]]), and expert reviewers within specific subjects. Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus under projects such as the [[Wikipedia:Neutrality Project|Neutrality Project]] or covered under editorial drives by groups such as the [[Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce|Cleanup Taskforce]].

===Technical===
Wikipedia uses the [[MediaWiki]] software. It's an [[open-source]] program that is used on all [[Wikimedia]] projects, and is also widely used on other third party websites on the [[internet]]. The hardware supporting the various projects is based on almost 100 servers hosted in various hosting centers around the world. Full descriptions of the various servers are available on [[m:Wikimedia_servers|this meta page]]. For technical information about Wikipedia, you can check [[Wikipedia:Technical_FAQ|Technical FAQs]].

==Feedback and questions==
Wikipedia itself is run as a communal effort. It is a community project whose end result is an encyclopedia. Feedback about content should, in the first instance, be raised on the discussion pages of those articles. You are invited to [[WP:BB|be bold]] and edit the pages yourself to add information or correct mistakes if you are knowledgeable and able to do so.

===Frequently asked questions (FAQ)===
{{main|Wikipedia:FAQ}}
:''FAQ index: [[:Category:Wikipedia FAQ|Index of all Wikipedia FAQ pages]]''

===Giving feedback===
There is an established escalation and dispute process within Wikipedia, as well as pages designed for raising questions, feedback, suggestions and comments:
* [[Wikipedia:Talk page|Talk pages]] - the associated discussion page for discussion of an article or policy's contents. This is usually the first place to go.
* [[Wikipedia:Vandalism]] - to report vandalism (you're encouraged to fix vandalism yourself as well as report it)
* [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution|Dispute resolution]] - for disputes which remain unresolved within an article's talk space.
* [[Wikipedia:Village pump|Village pump]] - the Wikipedia discussion area, part of the [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|community portal]].

See also:
* [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org Bug tracker], for reporting issues with the Wikipedia web site or the [[MediaWiki]] software that runs it
* [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)|Village pump: proposals page]] for non-policy suggestions
* [[Wikipedia:Help desk]] - Wikipedia's general help desk, if other pages haven't answered your query.

===Research help and similar questions===
Facilities for help for users researching specific topics can be found at:
* [[Wikipedia:Requested articles]] - to suggest or request articles for future.
* [[Wikipedia:Reference desk]] - to ask for help with any questions, or in finding specific facts.
Because of the nature of Wikipedia, it's encouraged that people looking for information should try and find it themselves in the first instance. If however you come across valid information missing from Wikipedia, [[Wikipedia:Be Bold|be bold]] and [[WP:BANAV|add it yourself]] so others can gain from your research too!

===Community discussion===
For specific discussion not related to article content or editor conduct, see the [[Wikipedia:Village pump|Village pump]], which covers such subjects as [[Wikipedia:Village pump (news)|news]] and [[Wikipedia:Announcements|announcements]], [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|policy]] and [[Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)|technical]] discussion, and information on other specialized portals such as the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help]], [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|reference]] and [[Wikipedia:Peer review|peer review]] desks. The [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|Community Portal]] is a centralized place to find things to do, collaborations, and general editing help information, and find out what's going on.

===Contacting individual Wikipedia editors===
If you need more information, the first place to go is the [[Help:Contents]]. To contact individual contributors, leave a message on their [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk page]]. Standard places to ask policy and project-related questions are the [[Wikipedia:Village pump|village pump]], online, and the [[Wikipedia:mailing lists|Wikipedia mailing lists]], over e-mail. You can also reach other [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedians]] via [[Wikipedia:IRC channels|IRC]] and [[Wikipedia:Instant Messaging Wikipedians|instant messenger]].

There is also a [[m:|'''meta'''-Wikipedia]], a site for coordinating the various Wikipedia projects and sister projects (and abstract discussions of policy and direction), and there are many different places for submitting [[Wikipedia:Bug reports|bug reports and feature requests]].

For a full list of contact options, see '''[[Wikipedia:Contact us]]'''.
