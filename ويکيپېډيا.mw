== Founding ==
{{main|History of Wikipedia}}

Wikipedia's [[English Wikipedia|English edition]] was launched on [[January 15]] [[2001]], as a complement to [[Nupedia]], an expert-written and now defunct encyclopedia.

[[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] were identified as co-founders of Wikipedia in 2001. Wikipedia's official personnel page from September 2001 states that Wales and Sanger were the two co-founders, and that there was no editor-in-chief.<ref name="foundercontroversy"/><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20011024225012/www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Wikipedia Web archive]</ref><ref name="Dan_Mitchell">{{

== Authorship and management ==
[[Image:Wikipedia—Old Logo—Transparent.png|left|thumb|The original Wikipedia logo]]

Maintenance tasks are performed by a group of volunteers; these include developers, who work on the [[MediaWiki]] software, and other trusted users with various permission levels including "steward", "bureaucrat" and "administrator."<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:User_access_levels&oldid=100160162 Wikipedia:User access levels]," Wikipedia ([[January 12]] [[2007]])</ref> Administrators are the largest group of specially privileged users, and have the ability to delete (remove) pages, lock articles from being changed, and deter users from editing.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators&oldid=102666051 Wikipedia:Administrators]", Wikipedia ([[January 23]] [[2007]])</ref>
Wikipedia is funded through the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Its 4th Quarter 2005 costs were $321,000 [[United States dollar|USD]], with hardware making up almost 60% of the budget.<ref>{{cite web|title=Budget/2005|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Budget/2005|accessdate=2006-03-11}}</ref> The Wikimedia Foundation currently relies primarily on private donations, and holds regular fundraisers;<ref>[http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising Fundraising], [[Wikimedia Foundation]]</ref> the January 2007 fundraiser raised just over $1 million.<ref>"[http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Fundraising_report&oldid=19190 Fundraising report]", [[Wikimedia Foundation]] ([[January 21]] [[2007]])</ref>

== Software and hardware ==
[[Image:Floridaserversfront1.jpg|thumb|left|Wikipedia receives between 10,000 and 30,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.<ref>"[http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/~leon/stats/reqstats/reqstats-monthly.png Monthly request statistics]", Wikimedia. Retrieved on [[2007-02-03]].</ref> More than 100 servers have been set up to handle the traffic.]]

The operation of Wikipedia depends on [[MediaWiki]], a custom-made, [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] [[wiki software]] platform written in [[PHP]] and built upon the [[MySQL]] database. The software incorporates modern programming features, such as a [[macro language]], [[variables]], a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template#Sub-template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]]. MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]]. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.

[[Image:Wikimedia-servers-2006-05-09.svg|thumb|right|Overview of system architecture, May 2006. See [[:meta:Server layout diagrams|server layout diagrams on Meta-Wiki]].]]

Wikipedia runs on dedicated [[computer cluster|clusters]] of [[Linux]] servers in [[Florida]] and in four other locations.<ref name="servers">{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers|title=Wikimedia servers at wikimedia.org|accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed [[multitier architecture]]. In January 2005, the project ran on 39 [[Dedicated hosting service|dedicated servers]] located in Florida. This configuration included a single master [[database server]] running [[MySQL]], multiple slave database servers, 21 [[web server]]s running the [[Apache HTTP Server]], and seven [[Squid cache]] servers. By September 2005, its [[computer cluster|server cluster]] had grown to around 100 servers in four locations around the world.<ref name="servers" />

Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of [[Squid cache|Squid caching]] servers. Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the [[Linux Virtual Server]] software, which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages for anonymous users are cached in a filesystem until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia's traffic load.

== Language editions ==
{{seealso|List of Wikipedias}}
[[Image:He-Wikipedia.png|right|thumb|300px|Wikipedia in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>[http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Main Page], [[Hebrew Wikipedia]]</ref>]]
Wikipedia has been described as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language".<ref>[[Jimmy Wales]], "[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2005-March/020469.html Wikipedia is an encyclopedia]", March 8 2005, <wikipedia-l@wikimedia.org></ref> There are presently 253 language editions of Wikipedia; of these, the top 14 have over 100,000 articles and the top 139 have over 1,000 articles.<ref name="ListOfWikipedias" />

Since Wikipedia is web-based and therefore worldwide, contributors of a same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (this is the case for the [[English Wikipedia|English edition]]). These differences may lead to some conflicts about spelling<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spelling|title= spelling | work = Manual of Style | publisher = Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> or points of view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias|title=Countering systemic bias|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> The English [[subdomain]] (en.wikipedia.org) receives approximately 51% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining 49% split among the other languages (Spanish: 15%, Japanese 5%, German: 5%, French: 4%, Polish: 3%, Portuguese: 2%, Arabic: 2%).<ref name="AlexaStats" />

Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view," they diverge on some points of policy and practice—most notably in their use of non-free images.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fair_use
|title=Fair use

|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Images_on_Wikipedia
|title=Images on Wikipedia
|publisher=Meta wiki
|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref>

Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by [[Wikipedia:Meta|Meta-Wiki]], the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia and maintain a [[m:List of articles every Wikipedia should have|list of articles every Wikipedia should have]]. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, foodstuffs, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small townships of the United States might only be available in English.

Multilingual editors of sufficient fluency are encouraged to translate articles manually; automated translation of articles is explicitly disallowed.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translations Wikipedia: Translation]. English Wikipedia, accessed on [[2007-02-03]]</ref> Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions.<ref>For example, "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation_into_English Translation into English]", Wikipedia. (March 9, 2005)</ref> Articles available in more than one language may offer "[[InterWiki]]" links, usually in their left margin, which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. Images and other non-verbal media are shared among the various language editions through the [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository. Beyond translations, some multilingual efforts are also realised thanks to the [[Wikipedia:Multilingual coordination|Multilingual coordination]].

== Content redistribution ==

Wikipedia's content has been mirrored and forked by many sites including [[database dump]]s.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} There is  even a free downloadable DVD version<ref>"[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/site.php?temp=down List of Mirrors Hosting the CD Iso.]" ''Wikipedia on DVD''. [[Linterweb]]. Accessed 1 June 2007</ref> developed by [[Linterweb]] which contains "1964 + articles".<ref>"[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/ Wikipedia on DVD]". Linterweb. Accessed 1 June 2007. "Linterweb is authorized to make a commercial use of the Wikipedia trademark restricted to the selling of the Encyclopedia CDs and DVDs."</ref><ref>"[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/site.php?temp=buy Wikipedia 0.5 Available on a CD-ROM]". ''Wikipedia on DVD''. Linterweb. Accessed 1 June 2007. "The DVD or CD-ROM version 0.5 was commercially available for purchase."</ref>

== Reliability and bias ==
[[Image:English Wikipedia Mainpage.png|right|thumb|English Wikipedia Main page on [[July 4]] [[2007]]]]
{{main|Reliability of Wikipedia}}

Wikipedia appeals to the authority of peer-reviewed publications rather than the personal authority of experts. Wikipedia does not require that its contributors give their legal names or provide other information to establish their identity. Although some contributors are authorities in their field, Wikipedia requires that even their contributions be supported by published sources.

Wikipedia tries to address the problem of [[systemic bias]], and to deal with zealous editors who seek to influence the presentation of an article in a biased way, by insisting on a neutral point of view. The English-language Wikipedia has introduced a scale against which the quality of articles is judged; other editions have also adopted this. Roughly 1200 articles have passed a rigorous set of criteria to reach the highest rank, "featured article" status; such articles are intended to provide thorough, well-written coverage of their topic, supported by many references to peer-reviewed publications.

In a study of Wikipedia as a community, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of participating in [[wiki]] software create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that a "creative construction" approach encourages participation.<ref>
Andrea Ciffolilli, "[http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_12/ciffolilli/index.html Phantom authority, self-selective recruitment and retention of members in virtual communities: The case of Wikipedia]", ''[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]'' December 2003.

In February 2007, an article in [[The Harvard Crimson]] newspaper reported that some of the professors at [[Harvard University]] do include Wikipedia in their syllabus, but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.<ref>Child, Maxwell L.,[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=517305 "Professors Split on Wiki Debate"], The Harvard Crimson, Monday, February 26, 2007.</ref>

In June 2007, former president of the [[American Library Association]] [[Michael Gorman]] condemned Wikipedia, along with [[Google]], for contributing to the creation of a generation of “intellectual sluggards”.<ref>Chloe Stothart, Web threatens learning ethos 
 , ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'', 2007, '''1799'''(22 June), page 2. [http://www.thes.co.uk/current_edition/]</ref> He also stated that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are “the intel­lectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything,” He also stated that “a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the internet” was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites. In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]) commented on the academics who cite Wikipedia that:

“You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the internet when academics are using search engines in their research,” she said. “The difference is that they have more experience of being critical about what is retrieved and whether it is authoritative. Children need to be told how to use the internet in a critical and appropriate way.”<ref>Chloe Stothart,   Web threatens learning ethos 
 , ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'', 2007, 22 June issue</ref>

== Awards ==
Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004.<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Trophy_box Trophy Box]", [[Meta-Wiki]] ([[March 28]] [[2005]]).</ref> The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual [[Prix Ars Electronica]] contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in [[Austria]] later that year. The second was a Judges' [[Webby Awards|Webby Award]] for the "community" category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-2004.php|title=Webby Awards 2004|publisher=The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences|date=2004|accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby. In September 2004, the [[Japanese Wikipedia]] was awarded a Web Creation Award from the Japan Advertisers Association. This award, normally given to individuals for great contributions to the Web in Japanese, was accepted by a long-standing contributor on behalf of the project.

In a 2006 ''Multiscope'' research study, the [[Dutch Wikipedia]] was rated the third best [[Dutch language]] site, after [[Google]] and [[Gmail]], with a score of 8.1.<ref>"[http://www.multiscope.nl/organisatie/nieuws/sberichten/nederlandse-wikipedia-groeit-als-kool.html Nederlandse Wikipedia groeit als kool] (Website in Dutch Language), Recovered [[December 27]] [[2006]]</ref> On 26 January 2007, Wikipedia was also awarded the fifth highest brand ranking by the readers of brandchannel.com, receiving 15% of the votes in answer to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?"<ref>{{cite news |first=Anthony |last=Zumpano |title=Similar Search Results: Google Wins |url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=352 |publisher=[[Interbrand]] |date=[[2007-01-29]] |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref> [[Jimmy Wales]] was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Anderson |title=Jimmy Wales |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187286,00.html |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=[[2006-04-30]] |accessdate=2006-12-18 }}</ref> In 2006, the [[Russian Wikipedia]] won the "Science and education" category of the "[[Runet Prize]]" (Russian: ''[[:ru:Премия Рунета|Премия Рунета]]'') award, supervised<ref>{{ru icon}}[http://lenta.ru/news/2005/08/29/premia/ Major award of Russian Internet became a state one] — [[Lenta.ru]], August 29 2005</ref> by the [[Politics of Russia|Russian government]] agency [[FAPMC]].

In November 2006, [[Turkish Wikipedia]] was nominated under the Science category for the ''Altın Örümcek Web Ödülleri'' (Golden Spider Web Awards), which are commonly known as the "Web Oscars" for Turkey. In January 2007, Turkish Wikipedia was given the award for "Best Content" in this competition. The award was given in a ceremony on [[January 25]] [[2007]] at Istanbul Technical University.

In July 2007 Wikipedia was the focus of a 30 minute documentary on BBC Radio 4 <ref> [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/efv21/ Radio 4 Documentary]</ref> which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the term is one of a select band of [[21st Century]] nouns that are so familiar ([[Google]],[[Facebook]], [[YouTube]]) that they no longer need explanation<ref> and are on a par with such [[20th Century]] terms as [[The Hoover Company|hoovering]] or [[coca-cola|coke]] </ref>. Many parody Wikipedia's openness, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles. Notably, comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and coined the related term "wikiality".<ref name="wikiality" /> Websites such as [[Uncyclopedia]] have also been set up parodying Wikipedia; its Main Page claims that it is the "content-free encyclopedia that anyone can edit,"<ref>{{cite web

== Related projects ==
A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the [[UK]], and covering the geography, art and culture of the [[UK]]. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the [[UK]]. The user-interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project have now been emulated on a website<ref name="Domesday Project">[http://www.domesday1986.com/ Web-based emulator of the Domesday Project User Interface] and data from the Community Disc (contributions from the general public) -- most articles can be accessed using the interactive map</ref>. One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was also created by the [[BBC]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia was relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which were both witty and informative. Both of these projects had similarities with Wikipedia, but neither gave full editorial freedom to public users.

Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects. The first, "''In Memoriam: September 11<!--Do not reformat this date, it is quoted--> Wiki''",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sep11memories.org/|title=sep11memories.org/<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> created in October 2002,<ref>[http://sep11memories.org/index.php?title=In_Memoriam&oldid=1502 First edit to the wiki] In Memoriam: September 11 wiki ([[October 28]] [[2002]])</ref> detailed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]; this project was closed in October 2006.<ref>"[http://sep11memories.org/index.php?title=In_Memoriam&oldid=11355 In Memoriam]",In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki ([[October 31]] [[2006]])</ref> [[Wiktionary]], a dictionary project, was launched in December 2002;<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_News&diff=prev&oldid=4133 Announcement of Wiktionary's creation]", [[December 12]] [[2002]]. Retrieved on [[2007-02-02]].</ref> [[Wikiquote]], a collection of quotations, a week after Wikimedia launched, and [[Wikibooks]], a collection of collaboratively written free books, the next month. Wikimedia has since started a number of other projects.<ref name="OurProjects">"[http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects Our projects]", [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Retrieved on [[2007-01-24]]</ref>

A similar non-wiki project, the [[GNUpedia]] project, co-existed with Nupedia early in its history; however, it has been retired and its creator, [[free software|free-software]] figure [[Richard Stallman]], has lent his support to Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Richard Stallman]]|title=The Free Encyclopedia Project|date=1999|publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]|url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html}}</ref>

Other websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development have drawn inspiration from or inspired Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], ''[[Enciclopedia Libre]]'', and [[WikiZnanie]] likewise employ no formal review process, whereas others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as the expert-written ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[H2G2|h2g2]] and [[Everything2]].

[[Conservapedia]] is a wiki encyclopedia project with goals similar to Wikipedia, but attempts to write articles from a [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Fiscal conservatism|economically conservative]] perspective. It was started in late 2006 by Andrew Schlafly, a son of [[Phyllis Schlafly]], who felt Wikipedia had a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] bias in its articles. Conservapedia is not affiliated with Wikipedia or Wikipedia's parent organization, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], although both use the [[free software|free]] [[MediaWiki]] software to power their site.
