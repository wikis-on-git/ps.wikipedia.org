The '''Grand Duchy of Luxembourg''' ([[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]]: ''Groussherzogtum Lëtzebuerg'', [[French language|French]]: ''Grand-Duché de Luxembourg'', [[German language|German]]: ''Großherzogtum Luxemburg'') is a small [[landlocked]] country in the [[western Europe]], bordered by [[بلجيم]], [[فرانسه]], and [[جرمني/آلمان]]. Luxembourg has a population of under half a million people in an area of about 2,600 [[square kilometre]]s (1,000&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]).

Luxembourg is a [[parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarchy]], ruled by a [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]].  It is the world's only sovereign [[Grand Duchy]].  Luxembourg is a founding member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], [[Benelux]], and the [[Western European Union]], reflecting the political consensus in favour of [[economic integration|economic]], political, and military integration.  [[Luxembourg City]], the [[capital]] and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the European Union.

Luxembourg lies on the cultural divide between [[Romance language|Romance]] Europe and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe, borrowing customs from each of the distinct traditions. Although [[French language|French]] is the predominant language in the daily life and streets, Luxembourg remains a [[trilingual]] country; [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] are [[official languages]].  Although it is a [[secular state]], Luxembourg is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Luxembourg}}

The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the construction of [[Luxembourg Castle]] in [[963]]. Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a small, but important, state of great strategic value. In [[1437]], the [[House of Luxembourg]] suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. In the following centuries, Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened over the years by its successive occupants, the [[Bourbons]], [[Habsburg]]s, [[Hohenzollern]]s, and the [[France|French]], among others. After the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|defeat]] of [[Napoleon]] in [[1815]], Luxembourg was disputed between [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] formed Luxembourg as a [[Grand Duchy]] in personal union with the Netherlands. Luxembourg also became a member [[German Confederation]], with a Confederate fortress manned by Prussian troops.

[[دوتنه:LuxembourgPartitionsMap english.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The three [[Partitions of Luxembourg]] have greatly reduced Luxembourg's territory.]]The [[Belgian revolution]] of [[1830]]–[[1839]] reduced Luxembourg's territory by more than half, as the predominantly [[francophone]] [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|western part of the country]] was transferred to [[Belgium]]. Luxembourg's independence was reaffirmed by the [[1839]] [[Treaty of London, 1839|First Treaty of London]].  In the same year, Luxembourg joined the [[Zollverein]]. Luxembourg's independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the [[1867]] [[Treaty of London, 1867|Second Treaty of London]], after the [[Luxembourg Crisis]] nearly led to war between Prussia and France. After the latter conflict, the Confederate fortress was dismantled.

The [[King of the Netherlands]] remained [[Head of State]] as [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], maintaining [[personal union]] between the two countries until [[1890]]. At the death of [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]], the Dutch throne passed to his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], while Luxembourg (at that time restricted to male heirs; see [[Salic Law]]) passed to [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg]].

Luxembourg was [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I|invaded and occupied by Germany]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], but was allowed to maintain its independence and political mechanisms.  It was again subject to [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|German occupation]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and was formally annexed into the [[Third Reich]] in [[1942]].

During [[World War II]], Luxembourg abandoned its policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]], when it joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in fighting Germany. Its government, [[government in exile|exiled]] to [[London]] set up a small group of volunteers, who participated in the [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy invasion]]. It became a founding member of the [[United Nations]] in [[1946]], and of [[NATO]] in [[1949]]. In [[1957]], Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (later the [[European Union]]), and, in [[1999]], it joined the [[euro]] currency area.  In 2005, a [[Referendum on EU treaty in Luxembourg|referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe]] was held in Luxembourg.

[[دوتنه:Luxembourg_City_2.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Luxembourg City, the capital of Luxembourg.]]
Luxembourg has a parliamentary form of government with a [[constitutional monarchy]] inherited by [[male-preference primogeniture]]. Under the constitution of [[1868]], executive power is exercised by the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]] or Grand Duchess and the [[cabinet]], which consists of a [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg|Prime Minister]] and several other ministers.  The Grand Duke has the power to dissolve the [[legislature]] and reinstate a new one.  However, since [[1919]], sovereignty has resided with the [[country]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/textescoordonnes/recueils/constitution_droits_de_lhomme/CONST1.pdf | title=Constitution of Luxembourg | accessdate=2006-07-23 | date=2005 | format={{PDFlink}} | publisher=Service central de législation }}</ref>

Legislative power is vested in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], a [[unicameral]] legislature of 60 members, who are directly elected to 5-year terms from four [[Legislative circonscriptions (Luxembourg)|constituencies]]. A second body, the [[Luxembourg Council of State|Council of State]] (''Conseil d'État''), composed of 21 ordinary citizens appointed by the Grand Duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ce.etat.lu/structure.htm | title=Structure of the Conseil d'Etat | accessdate=2006-07-23 | publisher=Conseil d'Etat }}</ref>

The Grand Duchy has three lower tribunals (''justices de paix''; in [[Esch-sur-Alzette]], [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg City]], and [[Diekirch]]), two district tribunals (Luxembourg City and Diekirch) and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg City), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation.  There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in Luxembourg City.

Luxembourg's contribution to its defence and to NATO consists of a small [[army]]. As a landlocked country, it has no [[navy]], and it has no [[air force]], except for the fact that the 18 NATO [[Airborne Warning And Control System|AWACS]] airplanes were registered as aircraft of Luxembourg as a matter of political and aviational convenience.<ref name="Aeroflight">{{cite web | url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/lux/luxaf1.htm | title=Luxembourg | accessdate=2006-07-23 | date=8 September 2005 | publisher=Aeroflight.co.uk }}</ref>  In a joint agreement with [[Belgium]], both countries have put forth funding for one [[A400M]] military cargo plane, and have it on order.  Luxembourg still maintains three [[Boeing 707]] model TCA for cargo and training purposes based in [[NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen]].<ref name="Aeroflight" />

== Geography and climate ==

[[دوتنه:Luxembourg City climate.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Luxembourg's climate is characterised by mild temperatures and high precipitation.]]
{{Main|Geography of Luxembourg}}

Luxembourg is one of the smallest countries in [[Europe]], and ranked [[List of countries by area|175th]] in size of all the countries of the world; the country is about 2,586 square kilometres (999&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]) in size, and measures 82 km (51 miles) long and 57 km (35 miles) wide.  To the east, Luxembourg borders the German ''[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]'' of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and, to the south, it borders the French ''[[Région in France|région]]'' of [[Lorraine]].  The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]] and [[Liège (province)|Liège]] to the west and to the north respectively.

The northern third of the country is known as the '[[Oesling]]', and forms part of the [[Ardennes]].  It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the [[Kneiff]], which is the highest point, at 560 [[metre]]s (1,837&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).  The region is sparsely populated, with only one town ([[Wiltz]]) with a population of more than 2,000 people.

The southern two-thirds of the country is called the '[[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]]', and is more densely populated than the Oesling.  It is also more diverse, and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions.  The [[Luxembourg plateau]], in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, [[sandstone]] formation, and the site of Luxembourg City.  [[Little Switzerland (Luxembourg)|Little Switzerland]], in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests.  The [[Moselle valley]] is the lowest-lying region, running along the south-eastern border.  The [[Red Lands]], in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.  The [[Central valleys (Luxembourg)|central valleys]] form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.

The border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], the [[Sauer]], and the [[Our River|Our]].  Other major rivers are the [[Alzette]], the [[Attert River|Attert]], the [[Clerve]], and the [[Wiltz River|Wiltz]].

Luxembourg has a [[temperate|mild]] [[Continental climate|continental]] climate, marked by high [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], particularly in [[summer]].




== Administrative Divisions ==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Luxembourg}}

Luxembourg is divided into 3 [[Districts of Luxembourg|districts]], which are further divided into 12 [[Cantons of Luxembourg|cantons]], and then into 116 [[Communes of Luxembourg|communes]].

Twelve of the communes have [[List of cities in Luxembourg|city status]], of which, Luxembourg City is the largest.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Luxembourg}} 

As of [[2000]], there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37 percent of the total population. The native population are ethnically a [[French]] and [[Germanic]] blend, alongside many immigrants from surrounding nations such as [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Belgium]], and [[Italy]]. In the past few years Luxembourg saw many immigrants from politically and civil unstable nations states of Balkan Europe such as [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]]. Annually, over 10,000 immigrants are entered into Luxembourg, mostly from [[EU]] states, as well as Eastern Europeans. There are an estimated 5,000 illegal immigrants in Luxembourg.[http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:NYZ6kvGhZ-QJ:www.compas.ox.ac.uk/publications/papers/Country%2520Case%2520Luxembourg.pdf+population+of+luxembourg&hl=en&gl=ca&ct=clnk&cd=5]

=== Language ===
{{Main|Languages of Luxembourg}} 

The linguistic situation in Luxembourg is characterised by the practice and the recognition of three official languages: [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], a [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] language of the [[Moselle valley|Moselle]] region similar to [[German language|German]].  Apart from being one of the three official languages, Luxembourgish is also considered the [[national language]] of the Grand Duchy.

None of the three languages predominates generally, and each is used as the primary language in certain spheres.  Luxembourgish is generally preferred for spoken use, but is superseded by both French and German for written purposes.  French is the language in which most government business is carried out.  German is the language of most [[Mass media|media]] and of the [[church]].<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite web | url=
http://www.eu2005.lu/fr/savoir_lux/lux_publications/a_propos_langues/a_propos_langues.pdf | title=À propos des langues | accessdate=2006-08-01 | format={{PDFlink}} | pages=pp. 3-4 |publisher=Service Information et Presse }}</ref>

In addition to the three native languages, [[English language|English]] is taught from a young age (mostly 2nd grade, i.e. at the age of 13 to 14 years), and most of the population of Luxembourg is proficient in English.  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], the languages of the two largest [[immigrant]] communities, are also spoken by large parts of the population, but relatively few from outside their respective communities.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Luxembourg}}

Since [[1979]], it has been illegal to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1979/0291104/0291104.pdf#page=2 | title=Mémorial A, 1979, No. 29 | accessdate=2006-08-01 | format={{PDFlink}} | publisher=Service central de législation }}</ref>  It is estimated that 87 percent of Luxembourgers are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and the other 13 percent are mostly [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]], [[Judaism|Jews]], and [[Islam|Muslims]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/lu.html | title=World Factbook - Luxembourg | accessdate=2006-07-23 | date=10 May 2006 | publisher=CIA }}</ref>  Luxembourg is a [[secular state]], but the state recognises certain religions as officially-mandated religions.  This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages.  Currently, religions covered by such arrangements are Judaism, Roman Catholicism, [[Eastern Orthodox|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] Orthodoxy, and Protestantism.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Luxembourg}}

Luxembourg's stable, high-income [[economic system|economy]] features moderate [[economic growth|growth]], low [[inflation]], and low [[unemployment]].  The industrial sector, which was until recently dominated by [[steel]], has become increasingly more diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products.  During the past decades, growth in the [[financial]] sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel.  Services, especially [[banking]] and other  [[Financial export|financial exports]], account for the majority of economic output. [[Agriculture]] is based on small, family-owned farms. Luxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to [[Belgium]] and [[the Netherlands]] (see ''[[Benelux]]''), and as a member of the [[EU]], enjoys the advantages of the open European [[market]].  Luxembourg possesses the highest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] in the world ([[US$]]72,945 as of [[2005]]), the fourth-highest [[HDI]], and the fourth-highest quality of life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf | title=World Life Quality Index 2005 | accessdate=2006-07-23 | date=2005 | format={{PDFlink}} | publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit }}</ref>  Unemployment is 4.8% of the labour force as of March 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/06/55&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en | title=Euro-zone unemployment down to 8.1% | accessdate=2006-07-23 | date=3 May 2006 | publisher=Eurostat }}</ref>  For the fiscal year of 2005 and current year 2006, Luxembourg has run a budget deficit for the first time in numerous years mostly due to slower growth and the slowdown of the international markets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/document/49/0,2340,en_2649_201185_37022129_1_1_1_1,00.html | title=Economic Survey of Luxembourg 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-23 | date=2006 | publisher=OECD }}</ref> 

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Luxembourg}}

Luxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours, although, being long a deeply rural and folkloric country, it retains some folk traditions.  There are also several notable museums, located mainly in Luxembourg City; these include the [[National Museum of History and Art]] (MNHA), the [[History Museum of the City of Luxembourg]], and the new [[Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art]] (Mudam).  Luxembourg City itself is on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] as a whole.

The country has produced some internationally-known artists, including the painter [[Joseph Kutter]] and the photographer [[Edward Steichen]].
