'''سوېلي کوريا''' چې رسمي نوم یې د '''کوریا جمهوریت''' (''په کوریایي: 대한민국'') دی چې په ځتیځې آسیا کې [[د کوریا ټاپووزمه|د کوریا د ټاپووزمې]] په سویلي برخه کې پروت دی.
, officially known as the '''د کوريا جمهوريت''', is an [[East Asia]]n [[state]] on the southern half of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. To the north, it is bordered by [[سهېلي کوريا]], with which it was a single country called [[Korea]] until 1945. To the west, across the [[Yellow Sea]], lies [[چين]], and to the southeast, across the [[Korea Strait]], lies [[جاپان]]. Approximately one-half of South Korea's population lives in or near the capital and largest city, [[سېول]], the third largest [[metropolitan area]] in the world.  

Since its founding in 1948, the country has struggled with the aftermath of 35 years of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], the [[Korean War]], and decades of military rule, seeing five major [[Constitution of the Republic of Korea|constitutional changes]]. Pro-democracy demonstrations during the 1980s led to free elections in 1987. South Korea is now a [[List of political parties in South Korea|multi-party]] [[democracy]].  

The [[Economy of South Korea|South Korean economy]] has advanced rapidly since the 1950s and is now the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|10th largest]] economy in the world. South Korea is also one of the world's most technologically advanced and digitally-connected countries. It has the second highest number of [[broadband]] [[Internet]] connections per capita in the world [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4903776.stm] and is a global leader in [[computer game]]s, [[digital display]]s, and [[mobile phone]]s.

South Korea's entertainment industry has grown explosively since the 1990s, producing Asia-wide successes in [[Korean-pop|music]], [[Korean drama|television]], and [[Korean cinema|film]] in a phenomenon known as ''[[Hallyu]]''<!-- please do not change this, which is correct under the Revised Romanization.  Thanks! -->, or the "Korean wave". However, the country still retains centuries-old customs and traditions, such as its unique [[Korean cuisine|cuisine]] and [[ancestor worship]].

{{main|Names of Korea}}
In the [[Korean language]], South Korea is called ''[[Revised romanization of Korean|Daehan Minguk]]'' ([[Hangul|대한민국]]{{audio|KO-Daehan Minguk-pronounce.ogg|listen}}, [[Hanja|大韓民國]], literally "Great Han People's Nation").  Its short name is ''Hanguk'' (한국, "Han Nation," usually referring to [[Korea]]) or ''Namhan'' (남한, "South Han", referring to South Korea).  ''Han'' refers to the ancient [[Samhan]] confederacies of southern Korean peninsula.  ''Hanguk'' is the most commonly used term by Koreans.

In English, the nation is often referred to simply as "Korea", deriving from the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, which in turn referred to the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] traders' rendering of Goryeo, "Cu'ree", may have made its way to [[Italy]] during the [[Middle Ages]], and "Corea" became a common European rendering. In the late 19th century, "Korea" became more widely used.

{{main|د کوريا تاريخ|د سوېلي کوريا تاريخ}}
[[دوتنه:Korea south map.png|thumb|200px|left|د سوېلي کوريا نخشه]]
At the end of [[World War II]], [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the southern and northern halves of Korea, respectively, dividing the peninsula at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. Despite promises of an independent and unified Korea in the 1943 [[Cairo Declaration]], the United States and Soviet Union helped establish two separate governments in 1948; the communist North and the capitalist South.

On [[June 25]], [[1950]], the North invaded the South, instigating the [[Korean War]]. The [[United Nations]] backed South Korea and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] backed North Korea, eventually reaching a stalemate.  The 1953 armistice split the peninsula along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|demilitarised zone]] at about the original demarcation line.  No peace treaty was ever signed, however, so the two countries are technically still at war.

In 1960, [[April Revolution|a student uprising]] overthrew the autocratic government of [[Syngman Rhee]] and South Korea saw a brief period of democratic reforms. However, much to the disappointment of the people, the new government was disoriented, and political chaos ensued. Then, a [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction|military coup]] led by general [[Park Chung-hee]], who thought that the communization of the peninsula would be inevitable if the Korean government was kept at this state, toppled the weak government the following year. Park took over as president from 1962 until his assassination in 1979, overseeing rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] as well as severe political repression.

Park's successor general [[Chun Doo-hwan]] launched a [[coup d'etat]] in 1980 to assume the presidency. Chun's [[Coup d'etat of December 12th|seizure of power]] was greeted by widespread protests culminating in the 1980 [[Gwangju Massacre]]. In the aftermath of that incident, the movement for democracy gained strength and was ultimately successful in forcing Chun to allow free elections and a change to [[Sixth Republic of South Korea|civilian democratic rule]] in 1988. That year, Seoul hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].

In 1996, South Korea became a member of the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. Despite a severe setback caused by the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997, the country soon emerged as a major economic power. In 2004, South Korea joined the "[[trillion dollar club]]" of world economies and, today, its [[standard of living]] is equal to that of many countries in [[Western Europe]]. 

In June 2000, as a part of South Korean president [[Kim Dae Jung]]'s [[Sunshine Policy]] of engagement, a historic first North-South summit took place in North Korea's capital [[Pyongyang]]. That year, Kim won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work for democracy and human rights and efforts at reconciliation between the two Koreas. Since then, regular contacts have led to a slow thaw in relations and economic ties through trade and investment have increased dramatically. Kim, who is now retired, has made plans to visit Pyongyang again in June 2006.

[[دوتنه:43325.jpg|right|thumb|240|President [[Roh Moo-hyun]]]]

South Korea is a [[democratic]] [[republic]] with powers shared between the [[president]], [[legislature]], and [[judiciary]]. Since 1948, the [[Constitution of the Republic of Korea|constitution]] has undergone five major revisions, each signifying a new republic. The current [[Sixth Republic of South Korea|Sixth Republic]] began with the last major constitutional revision in 1988.

The [[head of state]] is the president, who is elected by direct popular vote for a single five-year term. In addition to being the commander-in-chief of the [[military of South Korea|armed forces]], the president also has considerable [[executive (government)|executive]] powers. The president appoints the [[prime minister]] with approval of the [[National Assembly of South Korea|National Assembly]], as well as appointing and presiding over the State Council of chief ministers.

The South Korean [[legislature]] is the [[National Assembly of South Korea|National Assembly]], a [[unicameral]] body in which members serve a four-year term of office. This legislature currently has 299 seats, of which 243 are elected by regional vote. The remainder are distributed by [[proportional representation]]. 

The South Korean [[judiciary]] is largely independent of the other two branches. The highest [[judiciary]] body is the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed by the president with the consent of the National Assembly. In addition, the [[Constitutional Court of South Korea|Constitutional Court]] oversees questions of constitutionality.

The main political parties in South Korea are the [[Uri Party]], the [[Grand National Party]] (GNP), the [[Democratic Labour Party (South Korea)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP), and the [[Democratic Party (South Korea)|Democratic Party]] (DP). The Uri Party was formed in late 2003 from a liberal faction of the DP (then the Millennium Democratic Party). It gained a slim majority in the National Assembly after the April 2004 legislative elections, but lost it in subsequent [[by-election]]s. The conservative GNP and centrist DP form the dominant political opposition. The progressive DLP is aligned with [[labour unions]] and [[Korean farmers|farmers]]' groups, and constitutes the left-wing opposition.

[[دوتنه:Satellite image of South Korea in January 2004.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Satellite image of South Korea.]]

South Korea occupies the southern portion of the [[Korean Peninsula]], which extends some 680 [[mile]]s (1,100 km) from the [[Asia]]n mainland.  This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the [[Yellow Sea]] to the west, and the [[Sea of Korea]] (East Sea) to the east.  Its southern tip lies on the [[Korea Strait]] and the [[East China Sea]]. The country's total area is 38,462.49 [[square mile]]s or 99,617.38 [[square kilometre]]s.<ref>The estimated area rises steadily from year to year, possibly due to land reclamation.  {{cite web|url=http://kosis.nso.go.kr/cgi-bin/sws_999.cgi?ID=DT_1A1&IDTYPE=3&A_LANG=1&FPUB=3&SELITEM=|work=Korea Statistical Information Service|title=행정구역(구시군)별 국토면적|accessdate=2006-03-27}}</ref>

South Korea's land is [[mountainous]], and most of it is not arable. Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, constitute only 30% of the total land area. South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains; a western region of broad coastal plains, river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the [[Nakdong River]].

About 3,000 [[island]]s, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts.  [[Jeju]] Island is located about 100 kilometres (about 60&nbsp;mi) off the southern coast of South Korea. It is the country's largest island, with an area of 1,845 square kilometres (712&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Jeju is also the site of South Korea's highest point:  [[Halla-san]], an extinct [[volcano]] on Jeju, reaches 1,950 metres (6,398&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level. 

The local [[climate]] is relatively [[temperate climate|temperate]], with [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] heavier in summer during a short rainy season called ''[[East Asian monsoon|jangma]]'', and winters that can be bitterly cold.   In [[Seoul]] the average January temperature range is -7 °[[Celsius|C]] to 1&nbsp;°C (19 °[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 33&nbsp;°F), and the average July temperature range is 22&nbsp;°C to 29&nbsp;°C (71&nbsp;°F to 83&nbsp;°F). Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer [[typhoons]] that bring strong winds and heavy rains.  The average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] varies from  1,370 millimetres (54&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in Seoul to 1,470 millimetres (58&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in Busan.

South Korea has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth largest]] economy in the world, and the third largest in Asia, behind only Japan and China. As one of the [[East Asian Tigers]], it achieved rapid economic growth through exports of manufactured goods. This is in sharp contrast to the stagnation of North Korea's economy, which has turned for the worse since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. South Korea's per capita GDP is now roughly 12 times that of North Korea. <ref>According to 2005 US government estimates (North:  $1800; South: $20,400).  {{cite web|url=http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html|title=GDP - Rank order - per capita (PPP)|work=CIA Factbook|accessdate=2004-04-06}}</ref>

In the 1950s, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in Asia.{{citation needed}} At the end of World War II, the country inherited a colonial economic system designed solely for Japan's expansion policy.{{citation needed}} Much of the country's infrastructure was destroyed during the Korean War that followed in 1950-1953.{{citation needed}} After the war, South Korea became heavily dependent on U.S. aid.<ref>Cumings (1997), 305-307; Nahm (1996), p. 448.</ref> 

Following the military coup led by general [[Park Chung-hee]] in 1962, South Korea embarked on a series of ambitious [[Five-Year Plans of South Korea|five-year plans]] for economic development. Emphasis shifted to foreign trade with the [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|normalization of relations with Japan]] in 1965 and a subsequent boom in trade and investment. Rapid expansion, first into light and then heavy industries, in the 1960s and 1970s followed. During this period, the South Korean economy grew at an average annual rate of 8.6%. <ref>Yang (1999), p. 594.</ref>

This phenomenal growth is often called the "[[Miracle on the Han River]]",{{citation needed}} the [[Han River]] being the main river that runs through the nation's capital and largest city, [[Seoul]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, growth continued as South Korea transformed itself from an exporter of mostly textiles and shoes into a major global producer of [[automobile]]s, [[electronics]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[steel]] and later, high-technology fields such as [[Computer display|digital monitors]], [[mobile phone]]s, and [[semiconductor]]s. 

[[دوتنه:20060219114035907727601400.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Administrative district centered around Nam-daemun in Seoul metropolitan area]]

The South Korean model of encouraging the growth of large, internationally competitive companies through easy financing and tax incentives led to the dominance of the family-controlled [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. These companies, known as [[chaebol]], flourished under the support of the Park regime.<ref>See ch. 6 in Cumings (1997).</ref> Some such as [[Hyundai]], [[Samsung]], [[Daewoo]], and [[LG Group|LG]] became global corporations. 

Since the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, however, the corporate landscape has changed considerably as a result of massive bankruptcies and government reforms. The crisis exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's economy, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing, and an undisciplined financial sector. This led to two rounds of financial and industrial restructuring, in 1997 and again following the collapse of Daewoo in 1999.<ref>KOIS (2003), pp. 238-239.</ref> Daewoo's collapse has been recorded as one of the world's largest bankruptcies in history.{{citation needed}} By 2003, just over one-half of the 30 largest chaebol from 1995 remained.<ref>18 out of 30, according to {{cite web|url= http://www.economist.com/countries/SouthKorea/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-Economic%20Structure|title=Country Studies:  South Korea|work=The Economist|date=2003-04-10|accessdate=2006-04-06}}</ref>

Between 2003 and 2005, economic growth has moderated to about 4% per year.{{citation needed}} A downturn in consumer spending, attributed to massive personal credit card debt, was offset by rapid export growth especially to China. In 2005, the government proposed labor reform legislation and a corporate pension scheme to help make the labor market more flexible, and new real estate policies to cool property speculation.{{citation needed}} Moderate inflation, low unemployment, an export surplus, and fairly equal distribution of income characterize this economy.{{citation needed}}

=== Transportation ===
{{main|Transportation in South Korea}}

[[دوتنه:KTX-train.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A KTX train stationed at East Daegu station.]]
'''Transportation in South Korea''' is provided by extensive networks of railways, highways, bus routes, ferry services, and air routes that criss-cross the country.

The [[Korean National Railroad]] provides frequent service to all major South Korean cities.  Two rail lines to [[North Korea]] are now being reconnected. The Korean [[high-speed railway]] system is known as [[Korea Train Express]] (KTX). 

Major cities have subway systems, including the popular [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]. Virtually all towns in South Korea are served by regional bus service. 

Highways in South Korea are classified into freeways (expressways/motorways), national highways, and various classifications below the national level.  Korea Highway Corporation operates the toll highways and service amenities en route.

The main international [[airport]] is [[Incheon International Airport]]. South Korea's national air carriers are [[Korean Air]] and [[Asiana Airlines]].

Most South Koreans live in urban areas, due to rapid migration from the countryside during the country's rapid economic expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/33.htm|title=South Korea|work=CIA Country Studies|accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref>  The capital city of [[Seoul]] is also the country's largest city and chief industrial center.

The population has also been shaped by international migration.  Following the [[Division of Korea|division of the Korean peninsula]] after [[World War II|WWII]], about 4 million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years due to emigration, especially to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. However, South Korea's burgeoning economy and improved political climate in the early and mid-1990s slowed the high emigration rates typical of the previous decade. Many of those who left the country chose to return. 

Although small, the percentage of non-Koreans in South Korea has risen rapidly in the early 21st century.  Officially, as of April 2005, the total number of known foreign labourers in South Korea stood at 378,000, 52% of whom were in the country without authorization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200512/kt2005123017515610230.htm|title=Migrants Want Flexible Employment System|work=Korea Times December 30 2005|accessdate=2006-04-04}}</ref> This foreign workforce mainly comes from South Asian and [[Southeast Asian]] nations.

Buddhism is stronger in the  east of the country, namely the [[Yeongnam]] and [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon]] regions, where it accounts for more than half of the religious population. Christianity, which first gained a foothold in Korea in the late 18th century, grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s; in large part by being at the forefront of the social justice movement against the ruling military regimes. South Korea is now the second largest missionary sending nation in the world (after the United States).

In its foreign relations, South Korea is primarily concerned with North Korea and the neighboring countries of China, Japan, and Russia, as well as its main ally, the [[United States]]. The US was the primary driver in the establishment and initial sustenance of the South Korea government in the 1950s; however, since the 1990s the two nations have often been at odds with regard to their policy towards North Korea. 

South Korea and China established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992, despite previous hostility dating back to the Korean War. South Korea's relations with Japan continue to be turbulent, primarily due to a number of [[Korean-Japanese disputes]] stemming from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] in addition to other Japanese [[List of Japanese War Atrocities|war atrocities against Asians]].

[[North Korea|North]] and South Korea continue to dispute which country should be deemed the "rightful successor" to the previous Korean states. Despite longstanding animosity following the [[Korean War]] in 1950 (which has still not officially ended), the South and North have in recent times sought to establish a more conciliatory relationship. This road has however been punctuated by a number of difficulties, including the [[North-South presidential summit corruption allegations]] in June 2000. Nevertheless, events such as the [[Olympic Games]], where the two Koreas currently enter the opening ceremonies together but still compete as separate teams, show a new and more optimistic side to the North-South relationship.

In addition, South Korea maintains diplomatic relations with approximately 170 countries.  The country has also been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1991, when it joined at the same time as North Korea.  It has also developed links with [[ASEAN]] as both a member of "ASEAN Plus three" and the [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS).

The South Korean military is composed of the [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROKA), [[Republic of Korea Navy]] (ROKN), [[Republic of Korea Air Force]] (ROKAF), and [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps]] (ROKMC), together with reserve forces. Many of these forces are concentrated near the border with North Korea. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically for a period of 24 months.  

From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. South Korea dispatched 320,000 troops to fight alongside American soldiers in the [[Vietnam War]]. Most recently, South Korea sent 3,200 troops in the form of the [[Zaytun Division]] to assist with reconstruction efforts in northern [[Iraq]].

[[Taekwondo]], a popular [[martial art]], originated in Korea. Taekwondo means ''technique of kicking and punching'', although the emphasis lies on the kicks. It became standard military training in South Korea, and in 1961 the rules were standardized and taekwondo became an official [[Olympic Games|Olympic sport]] in 2000. Other Korean martial arts include [[hapkido]] and [[taekkyeon]]. 

Baseball was first introduced in Korea by an American missionary named [[Phillip Gillette]] in 1905 and has since become the most popular spectator sport in South Korea.<ref>KOIS (2003), p. 632.</ref> The first South Korean professional sports league was the [[Korea Baseball Association]], established in 1982. During the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|2006]] [[World Baseball Classic]], South Korea reached the final four before losing to Japan. Prior to that final match, the South Korean team was the only undefeated team, and had beaten Japan twice and the United States once.

Other popular sports in South Korea include [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[golf]], and [[ice hockey]]. Women's golf is especially strong, with over 30 South Koreans playing on the world's leading women's tour, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]], including stars such as future [[World Golf Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Se Ri Pak]]. Rising star [[Michelle Wie]] is also of Korean heritage, with both parents from South Korea. South Korea's Olympic teams have also traditionally performed strongly in [[archery]], [[boxing]], [[judo]], [[short track speed skating]], [[taekwondo]], and [[wrestling]]. 

In 1988, South Korea hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in Seoul]]. There is an ongoing campaign to have a future [[Winter Olympics]] held in [[Pyeongchang County]]. South Korea has hosted the [[Asian Games]] on numerous occasions.

The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] was jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan, and [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]] became the first [[Asian Football Confederation|Asian team]] to reach the semi-finals. During the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]] the South Korean short track team dominated their event, taking home six of the eight gold medals available as well as three silvers and one bronze. Skaters [[Ahn Hyun Soo]] and [[Jin Sun Yu]] were the second and third persons in the Games to win three gold medals. 

The [[Korea Republic national football team]], also known as the "[[Taeguk Warriors]]", qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Germany]] for their sixth consecutive World Cup.
