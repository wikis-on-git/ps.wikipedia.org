It was apparently during his sojourn in the student world of [[Morningside Heights]] on Manhattan’s upper west side near Columbia’s campus that he became interested in [[Marxism]], although Columbia had not yet encountered
the radical tumult of the late 1960s. 

In 1965 he returned to Afghanistan without his doctorate and accepted a teaching post at a girls’ high school.
He quickly joined the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA), becoming a prominent member of the marxist ''Khalq'' (People) faction. 

President Daoud was still in the besieged palace when Amin took command of the coup after he and his comrades were released from the prison.

After the death of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in [[1978]] the PDPA gained power with [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]] becoming President of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] and secretary general of the PDPA while Amin and [[Babrak Karmal]] became deputy prime ministers. An attempt to institute Marxist-Leninist reforms provoked widespread resistance and a number of violent revolts. 

In February 1979 the [[United States|U.S.]] Ambassador [[Adolph Dubs]] was killed. The Khalq faction was gaining political power over the Parcham faction, with Karmal exiled to Europe. Amin had gained considerable control by March 1979 and was named Prime Minister although Taraki retained his other posts. 

The unrest continued however and the regime was forced to seek more [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aid. It was in that meeting between Taraki and [[Leonid Breznev]] that the decision of removing Amin took place.

===<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype"> د ترکي وژنه ===

After Taraki returned to Kabul he requested that Amin meet with him. Amin agreed to the meeting only if his safety was guaranteed by the [[Soviet]] Ambassador, Alexander Puzanov. Such assurances were provided, but not in good faith. 

Amin knew however what Taraki's intentions were and the demand for his safety being guaranteed by the Soviet Ambassador, probably a shrewd ploy on the part of Amin to mislead Taraki. 

When Amin arrieved at the '''People's Palace''', a shootout occurred. Amin escaped unhurt, returned later to the palace with some of his supporters and used the '''Palace Guard''' to take Taraki prisoner. 

On [[September 14]], [[1979]] Amin then took control of the government. A few days later Amin's government announced that Taraki died of an "undisclosed illness".

==<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">د افغانستان د جمهوريت ولسمشر ( سېپتمبر ١٩٧٩ &ndash;  ډېسمبر ١٩٧٩)==

[[Image:Khalq1978-80.gif|thumb|<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">د حفيظ الله امين د ولسمشرۍ په وخت کې د افغانستان د خلق د ډيموکراټيک ګوند بېرغ.]]

His rule was notable for its brutality. The Soviets admitted that perhaps 500 PDPA members had forfeited their lives. Amin now assumed leadership and carried out his own purges of the PDPA. Attempting to pacify the population, he released a list of some 18,000 people who had been executed and blamed the executions on Taraki. The official Afghan figures are much higher-15,000 to 45,000. 

Aditional to that, Amin was not a popular person. He was rapidly accumulating as enemies a large group of very angry relatives of victims, and PDPA members must have lived in fear of their lives.

During this period, many Afghans fled to [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] and began organizing a resistance movement to the "atheistic" and "infidel" communist regime backed by the Soviets. Although the groups organizing in the Pakistani city of [[Peshawar]] would later, after the Soviet invasion, be described by the western press as "freedom fighters".

In mid-November 1979 Amin launched a large military operation against the resistance at [[Sayd Karam]] in [[Paktia]] Province. The offensive was successful, eliminating as many as 1,000 or more resistance fighters, relatives, and supporters, driving most of the remainder into Pakistan, and obliterating sympathetic villages. 

Amin also began unfinished attempts to moderate what many Afghans viewed as an '''Anti-Islam''' regime. Promising more religious freedom, repairing [[mosques]], presenting copies of the [[Koran]] to religious groups, invoking the name of [[Allah]] in his speeches, and declaring that the '''Saur Revolution''' was "totally based on the principles of Islam." Yet many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime's harshest measures and the [[Soviet]]s, worried about their huge investment in Afghanistan might be jeopardized, increased the number of ''advisers'' in Afghanistan. 

Amin worked to broaden his base of support and purged the PDPA of his perceived enemies. His regime was still under pressure from the insurgency in the country and he tried to gain [[Pakistan]]i or American support and refused to take Soviet advice. 

Because of or in spite of this, Amin attempted to solidify his hold on the country militarily. This display of independent nationalism was not tolerated by [[Moscow]], and on [[December]] [[1979]], the Soviets began their invasion of Afghanistan.

[[Islamic]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s in the mountainous countryside harassed the Afghan army to the point where the government of President [[Hafizullah Amin]] turned to the Soviet Union for increasingly large amounts of aid. 

The [[Soviet Union]] decided to increase its military aid to Afghanistan in order to maintain the [[Communist]] government, but was dissatisfied with Amin as the [[Afghan]] leader capable of accomplishing this goal. Soviet leaders, based on the information from [[KGB]], thought that Amin destabilized the situation in Afghanistan. 

The last arguments to overthrow Amin were obtained by the [[KGB]] from its agents in Kabul, that two of Amin's guards killed the former president [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] and that Amin was supposedly a [[CIA]] agent. There were, however, some sceptics among the Soviet military advisors of Afghan army, principaly '''General Vasily Zaplatin''', a political advisor at that time, who claimed that four of the young Taraki's ministers were responsible for the destabilization. 

Amin feared the [[Soviet]] troops would be used to depose him. Fearing for his survival and uncertain of whom he could trust, he started putting his relatives into positions of power. Amin put one of his nephews in charge of the secret police, but that nephew was assassinated. Amin moved his headquarters out of [[Kabul]] in concern for his own safety. 

===<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype"> د روسانو له خوا د حفيظ الله امين وژل کېدل ===

On [[December 22]], the Soviet advisors to the Afghani Armed Forces advise them to undergo maintenance cycles for tanks and other crucial equipment. Meanwhile, Telecommunications links to areas outside of Kabul are severed, isolating the capital. Viewing this, Amin moves the offices of the president to the [[Tajbeg Palace]], believing this location to be more defensible during invasion.

Five days later, on [[December 27]], elements of the [[KGB]] [[Spetsnaz]] ([[Alpha Group]]), in Afghan uniforms storm the Presidential Palace in [[Kabul]], taking relatively few casualties, killing President [[Hafizullah Amin]] and his 200 [[elite]] guards in the process. 

The Soviet [[Spetsnaz]] blew up Kabul's communications hub, paralyzing the Afghani military command,  at 7:00 P.M. By 7:15 seized the '''Ministry of Interior'''. The Soviet military command at [[Termez]] did not wait until Amin's capture to announce on Radio Kabul (in a broadcast prerecorded by [[Babrak Karmal]]) that Afghanistan had been liberated from Amin's rule. 

According to the [[Soviet]] [[Politburo]] they were only complying with the 1978 '''Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness''' that former President Taraki signed. The execution of '''Hafizullah Amin''' was, according to the Soviets, the action of the '''Afghan Revolutionary Central Committee'''. That committee then elected as head of government [[Babrak Karmal]], who was in exile in [[Moscow]].

===<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype"> د سي آی اې [[CIA]] د جاسوسۍ تور ===

The Soviet government and press repeatedly referred to Amin as a "CIA agent", a charge which was greeted with great skepticism in the [[United States]] and elsewhere. One strong argument against that belief, was that he always and everywhere showed official friendliness to the Soviet Union. And even after the assassination of Amin and two his sons, his wife claimed that she and her remaining sons only wanted to go to the Soviet Union, because her husband was loyal to them until the end. 

She did eventually go to the [[Soviet Union]] to live. However Zaplatin failed to emphasize this enough [http://zavtra.ru/cgi/veil/data/zavtra/99/316/61.html]. However, enough circumstantial evidence supporting the charge exists so that it perhaps should not be dismissed entirely out of hand.
