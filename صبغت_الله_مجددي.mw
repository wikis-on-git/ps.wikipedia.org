'''صبغت الله مجددي''' ( [[1926]] - ). په ۱۹۹۲ کال کې د کمونېسټي رژيم د راپرځېدو وروسته د افغانستان د اسلامي دولت د لومړني ولسمشر په توګه دنده درلوده. صبغت الله مجددي د [[نجات اسلامي افغانستان]] د ګوند مشر هم دی. 

Professor Mojaddedi transferred power to President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] after serving a two-month term, based on a prior agreement that was reached by the [[Mujahideen]] forces in [[Pakistan]]. He couldn't establish any types of reconciliation among the Mujahideen fractions. 

In recently political activities during the Taliban power, Mojadidi was not involved. In December 2003, he served as the chairman of the [[Loya Jirga]] that approved Afghanistan's new constitution.

== <font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">پخواني وختونه سياسي او شخصي ژوند==

He belongs to the Mojaddedis, known as descendents of the [[Mujaddid]] [[Ahmad Sirhindi]]. He was born in 1925 in [[Herat]] province in western Afghanistan.

He is a well regarded [[Islam]]ic [[scholar]] and one of the most prominent and prolific advocates of an independent Afghanistan since the early [[1950s]]. 

He completed post-graduate study at [[al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], focusing on [[Sharia|Islamic Law]] and [[Fiqh|Jurisprudence]]. In Afghanistan, he taught at '''Habibia High School''' after his graduation, and later in the [[Kabul University]].

Mojadeddi was imprisoned from 1959 to 1964 for his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate [[Soviet]] [[Premier of the USSR|Prime Minister]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He also participated in anti-reformist and anti-soviet demonstrations in [[Kabul]] in 1970. 

Fearing repression, he chose exile after Daoud's coup in 1973. Forced to flee the country in order to escape arrest, In exile he carried out the responsibility of the [[Copenhagen]] Mosque in [[Denmark]].

== The Soviet Invasion ( 1979 - 1989 )==

In 1979 he founded the '''Afghan National Liberation Front''', an islamic, traditionnal party . Although his party's military might remained marginal due to a bias in weapons distribution by the [[Pakistan]]i [[ISI]], Mujaddadi remained a highly respected leader among the Mujahideen.

His reputation as a moderate was finally recognised in 1989, when he was selected as the head of the '''Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan'''. Also as head of the Interim Afghan Government, he met with then President of the [[United States]] [[George H.W. Bush]].

He was ready to assume his position when, on April 1992, the Mujaheddin enter [[Kabul]], and the government of President [[Mohammad Najibullah]] collapsed. A cease-fire was achieved with Professor [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] of the [[Jamait-i-Islami]] recognized as the head of the guerrilla coalition and of the country.

Eleven days later, in an agreement that excluded the Shi'a parties and the [[Hizb-i Islami]] led by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], the parties in Kabul announced that '''Sibghatullah Mojadeddi'''  would become president for two months, followed by  [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] of the Jamiat-i-Islami for four years. 

During this period, a [[Loya Jirga]], or grand council of Afghan elders, would convene and designate an interim administration to hold power for up to a year, pending elections. But in May 1992, Rabbani prematurely formed the leadership council, undermining Mojaddedi’s fragile authority. 

In June, Mojaddedi surrendered power to the Leadership Council, which then elected Rabbani president. Rejecting the arrangement, Hekmatyar launched massive and indiscriminate rocket attacks on Kabul that continued intermittently for three years, until he was forced out of the Kabul area in February 1995. 

His decision to declare a general state of [[amnesty]] for all citizens regardless of [[politics|political]] ties until the legal system of the country had been rehabiliated is one of his presidency's legacies.

Mojaddedi completed his term in office and returned to private. During [[Taliban]] rule, he settled in [[Pakistan]].

In [[December]] [[2003]], Professor Mojaddedi was elected to serve as the chairman of the [[Loya Jirga]], and under his leadership the Loya Jirga was able to approve a new [[constitution]] for the country. 

When the constitutional loya jirga began its proceedings, Mojaddedi, offended many women when he refused to name a woman as one of his  three deputies proclaimed to the assembled female delegates, "Even God has not given you equal rights because under his decision two women are counted as equal to one man."

Since [[March 16]] [[2005]], serving as the chairman of the '''National Commission for Peace in Afghanistan''', professor Mojaddedi has been working to bring about country-wide reconciliation. He was appointed to this post by president [[Hamid Karzai]].

The commission's objective is to promote reconciliation. In a press conference held on May 9, 2005 in Kabul, Mojaddedi announced that participation in the reconciliation process is open to all Afghans, including [[Mullah Omar]] (head of the Taliban) and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. 

He claimed that his remarks were misconstrued by the media, and that it was up to the Afghan nation to pardon or punish Mullah Omar and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. He also stated that policies change with time, and added that the reconciliation commission was working independently with full backing from President Karzai.

Mojaddedi was quoted as saying: "If they accept Afghanistan's new basic law and give up fighting, they may be forgiven. But personally speaking, I can't let them off them because I don't have the right." 

On December 18th 2005, Afghanistan's parliament elected Sibghatullah Mojadidi as the
leader of the legislature's 102-seat upper house, the Meshrano Jirga, for a 5 year term.  

He now lives in [[Kabul]].
