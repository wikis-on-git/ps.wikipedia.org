{{اسلام}}
'''اسلام''' ([[عربي ژبه|عربي]]: {{Ar|الإسلام}}; ''{{ArabDIN|}}'' ({{Audio|ar-al_islam.ogg|غوږ شه!}}), "اطاعت" (د [[الله]] د رضا)) يو [[مونوتيزم|مونوتېسټېک]] (يانې د يو واحد څېښتن تعالی يا خدای تعالی ته د غاړې ايښودلو) عقيده ده. پخپله د اسلام وی په مانا د سولې، امن، سلامتي د ايمان او جوړې روغې رامنځته کول دي. دا د [[ابراهيمي دين]]ونو څخه يو دين دی او د نړۍ دوهم لوی [[مذهب]] ګڼل کېږي. د اسلام د دين لارويانو ته '''[[مسلمانان]]''' وايي. مسلمانان پدې عقيده دي چې [[الله]] انسانانو ته د لارښوونې هدايت د ډېرو [[پيغمبر]]انو په ذريعه کړی او [[محمد]] د الله تعالی تر ټولو وروستی پيغمبر ([[د اسلام پيغمبر]]) دی.
[[religion]] originating with the teachings of [[Muhammad]], a 7th century [[Arab]] religious and political figure. The word ''Islam'' means "submission", or the total surrender of oneself to [[God]] (Arabic: [[Allah|{{lang|ar|الله}}, Allāh]]). An adherent of Islam is known as a [[Muslim]], meaning "one who submits (to God)".<ref name="EoI-Islam">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L.

Muslims believe that God [[revelation|revealed]] the [[Qur'an]] to Muhammad, God's [[Seal of the prophets|final prophet]], and regard the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] (words and deeds of Muhammad) as the fundamental sources of Islam.<ref>See:

Islam includes many religious practices. Adherents are generally required to observe the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], which are five duties that unite Muslims into a community.<ref>Esposito (2002b), p.17</ref> In addition to the Five Pillars, [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (''sharia'') has developed a tradition of rulings that touch on virtually all aspects of life and society. This tradition encompasses everything from practical matters like [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] and [[Islamic banking|banking]] to [[jihad|warfare]].<ref>See:

Almost all Muslims belong to one of two major denominations, the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]]. The schism developed in the late 7th century following disagreements over the religious and political leadership of the Muslim community. Roughly 85 percent of Muslims are Sunni and 15 percent are Shi'a. Islam is the predominant religion throughout the [[Middle East]], as well as in parts of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. Large communities are also found in [[Islam in China|China]], the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Islam in Russia|Russia]]. There are also large Muslim immigrant communities in wealthier, and more developed parts of the world such as [[Western Europe]] and the [[USA]]. About 20 percent of Muslims live in [[Arab world|Arab countries]].<ref>See:

==آرپوهه==
اسلام د عربي ژبې د درې تورو، {{ArabDIN|[[سين]]-[[لام]]-[[ميم]]}} ({{ar|'''س'''-'''ل'''-'''م'''}}) نه راوتلی. اسلام د همدغې ريښې يو تجريدي فعل دی چې مانا يې ده "تسليم يا ځان سپارل، څان خدای ته سپارل، اطاعت کول او د سولې" په مانا هم ده.

کله چې د پورتني ويي د ريښو په هکله په نورو ژبو کې څېړنه کوو، نو بيا په عبراني ژبه کې د پورتني وييکي ضمني ماناګانې هم راوځي. په عبراني ژبه کې د ''[[شلوم]]'' ويي، د (شين-لامد-ميم) نه خپلې ريښې اخلي ({{Ivrit|'''ש'''-'''ל'''-'''ם'''}}). په ډېرو [[سېمېټک ژبو]] کې د همدغه لغت ضمني ماناګانې شته، چې مانا يې بشپړکېدل، پوره کېدل، سر ته رسېدنه، ښه اوسېدنه، هوسا اوسېدنه، يو داسې اصطلاح چې په ژباړه کې اکثراً د سولې د وييکي مانا په ځان کې رانغاړي، ورکوي.

The word is given a number of meanings in the [[Qur'an]]. In some verses (''[[ayat]]''), the quality of Islam as an internal conviction is stressed: "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam."<ref>{{cite quran|6|125|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|61|7|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|39|22|style=ref}}</ref> Other verses connect ''islām'' and ''[[Deen (Arabic term)|dīn]]'' (usually translated as "religion"): "Today, I have perfected your religion (''dīn'') for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion."<ref>{{cite quran|5|3|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|19|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|83|style=ref}}</ref> Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.<ref>See:

هغه نور عربي وييونه چې د {{ar|'''س'''-'''ل'''-'''م'''}} نه راوتلي:

* [[سلام]], چې د "سولې او سلامتۍ" په مانا ده او د ورځيني روغبړ يوه اهمه کلمه ده, [[سلام عليکم|السلام عليکم]] (ته دې سلامت وې/سلامتي دې پر تا وي).
* السلام(سوله)د الله تعالی د ٩٩ مبارکو نومونو نه يو نوم دی چې په [[قران]] کې هم راغلی.
* [[مسلمان]], د اسلام د دين مننونکي ته وايي او مانا يې ده هغه څوک چې ځان الله ته تسليم کوي او يا د الله اطاعت کوي.
* سلامه, د "سلامتي," په مانا ده چې د "خدای پامانۍ" په وخت کې وييل کېږي، د "مع السلامه" مانا ( سلامتۍ سره[لاړ شه]) ده.

==عقيده==
{{main|Aqidah}}
د اسلام بنسټيزه عقيده شهادت دی چې د ګواهۍ مانا لري [[شهادت]] ('''  لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله ''')"نشته بل کوم خدای يا معبود پرته د الله نه او محمد صلی الله عليه وسلم د الله پيغمبر دی." د دې لپاره چې څوک مسلمان شي، نو سړي ته پکار ده چې دغه پورتنی شهادت د يو څو شاهدانو مخکې ووايي او پرې ايمان راوړي. او که چېرته يو څوک غواړي چې اسلام ته راشي نو هغه يا هغې ته پکار ده چې بايد د زړه له صدق نه وغواړي او بيا د دې نه مخکې چې شهادت ووايي نو پکار ده چې د شهادت په اصلي مانا او مفهوم پوه وي.<br>
مسلمانان په دې عقيده دي چې الله (ج) انسانانو ته خپل پيغام د حضرت محمد (ص) او د نورو پيغمبرانو لخوا لکه حضرت آدم عليه السلام، حضرت نوح عليه السلام، حضرت ابراهيم عليه السلام، حضرت موسی عليه السلام او حضرت عيسی عليه السلام له لورې په بېلابېلو وختونو کې رالېږلی. مسلمانان په دې عقيده هم دي چې حضرت محمد صلی الله عليه وآله وسلم د الله وروستنی پيغمبر و او د هغه نه وروسته تر قيامته بل هېڅ کوم پيغمبر نه راځي. نو ددې پخاطر مسلمانان بايد د حضرت محمد صلی الله عليه وآله وسلم په لارښوونې تر قيامته پورې عمل وکړي.
<br>
مسلمانان پدې عقيده دي چې قران د انسانانو د لارښوونې يو داسې کتاب دی چې تر اوسه پکې هېچا ګوتې نه دي وهلي او پدې کتاب کې هېڅ کومه نيمګړتيا نشته، او هېڅ کله به پکې بدلون را نه شي، او دا د خدای له لورې انسانانو ته وروستی نازل شوی کتاب دی. مسلمانان دا هم وايي چې د انجيل او تورات هغه اسماني کتابونه دي چې د بېلابېلو مذهبي فرقو له لورې پکې لاسوهنې شوي په بل ډول سره ليکل شوي او په ناسمه توګه تعبير شوي او د دغو اسماني کتابونو اصلي بڼې اوس نه شته او د وخت په تېرېدو سره خلکو هماغه لومړني لارښوونې چې په اصلي اسماني کتابونو کې وه هېر کړي، او يا يې هم درغلي پکې کړې. نو ددغه ليد پر بنسټ الله تعالی انسانانو ته د لارښوونې لپاره قرآن راولېږه چې په دې کې هماغه د اصلي انجيل او تورات لارښوونو سره سره د هغو وختونو د خلکو چې پېغمبران به يې ځورول او وژل به يې او د الله تعالی له احکامو د سرغړونې سره سره يې د خپل زاتي ګټو لپاره د الله په کلام کې چې بدعتونه راوستلي دا ټول تاريخ ثبت دی. 
<br>
مسلمانان دا هم وايي چې اسلام هماغه دين دی چې د آدم عليه السلام له وختونو نه او د نورو پيغمبرانو په وختونو کې هم وه، او دغو ټولو پيغمبرانو د همدغه مذهب په لار د تلو ټينګار کړی. اسلامي کتابونه او ليکنې د يهوديت او عيسويت د هغو اصلي لارښوونو نه راوتلي چې د حضرت ابراهيم عليه السلام په وختونو کې يې ښوونې شوي نو د همدغه پخاطر دا درېواړه مذهبونه يعنی يهوديت، عيسويت او اسلام چې درېواړه سره ګډې ريښې لري، د ابراهيمي دينونو په نامه سره هم يادېږي.  په قرآن عظيم الشان کې يهوديانو او عيسويانو ته د اهل الکتاب يا هغه خلک چې کتابونه ورباندې نازل شوي، په نامه اشاره شوې ده.    
<br>
اسلام يو [[دين]] دی، دين '''د ژوندون لار''' مانا لري او يا هم په بله وينا د لارښوونې لار. 


According to the Qur'an all Muslims have to believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets of Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".<ref>{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}</ref> Also, there are other beliefs that differ between [[Kalam|particular sects]]. The [[Sunni]] concept of predestination is called [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]],<ref>{{Muslim|1|1}}</ref> while the [[Shi'a]] version is called [[Adalah|divine justice]]. Unique to the Shi'a is the doctrine of ''[[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamah]]'', or the political and spiritual leadership of the [[Imam]]s.<ref>See:
* Farah (2003), p.109
* Momen (1987), p.176</ref>

Muslims believe that God [[revelation|revealed]] his final message to humanity through the Islamic prophet Muhammad via the [[Gabriel|angel Gabriel]]. For them, Muhammad was God's final prophet and the Qur'an is the revelations he received over more than two decades.<ref>Esposito (2004), pp.17,18,21</ref> In Islam, prophets are men selected by God to be his messengers. Muslims believe that prophets are human and not divine, though some are able to perform miracles to prove their claim. Islamic prophets are considered to be the closest to perfection of all humans, and are uniquely the recipients of divine [[revelation]]—either directly from God or through angels.<ref>See:
* Momem (1987), p.176
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> Islamic theology says that all of God's messengers since [[Adam]] preached the message of Islam—submission to the will of the one God. Islam is described in the Qur'an as "the primordial nature upon which God created mankind",<ref>{{cite quran|30|30|style=ref}}</ref> and the Qur'an states that the [[proper name]] ''Muslim'' was given by [[Abraham]].<ref>See:
* {{cite quran|22|78|style=ref}}
* "Islam", ''Encyclopedia of Religion''</ref> 

As a historical phenomenon, Islam originated in [[Arabia]] in the early 7th century.<ref>"Islam", ''Encyclopedia of Religion''</ref> Islamic texts depict Judaism and Christianity as prophetic successor traditions to the teachings of Abraham. The Qur'an calls [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s "[[People of the Book]]" (''ahl al-kitāb''), and distinguishes them from polytheists. Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, the ''[[Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]) and the ''[[Injil]]'' ([[Gospels]]), had become [[tahrif|distorted]]—either in interpretation, in text, or both.<ref name="Distorted"/>

===د عقيدې شپږ ارکان===
مسلمانان شپږ بنسټيزه ارکانونو باندې عقيده لري:

# د الله تعالی په وحدانيت باندې ايمان راوړل او يواځی الله ته عبادت او اطاعت کول او د هغه نه مرسته غوښتل ''[[توحيد]]''.
# د الله تعالی په پيغمبرانو باندې ايمان راوړل ([[پېغمبران#د اسلام له نظره|''انبيا‌ء'']])  چې ټول پېغمبران (''[[رسول]]'') د الله له خوا رالېږل شوي. ([[د اسلام پېغمبران]] وګورۍ.)
# په اسماني کتابونو عقيده(''[[کتب]]''):
#* په [[ابراهيمي صحيفو]] (ابراهيم عليه السلام باندې نازل شوې صحيفې)
#* په [[تورات]] باندې ايمان راوړل چې همدا کتاب پر [[موسی (ع)]] باندې نازل شوی.
#* په [[زبور]] باندې ايمان راوړل چې همدا کتاب پر [[داود (ع)]] باندې نازل شوی.
#* په [[انجيل]] باندې ايمان راوړل چې همدا کتاب پر [[عيسی (ع)]] باندې نازل شوی.
#* په [[قرآن]] باندې ايمان راوړل چې همدا کتاب پر [[محمد صلی الله عليه وسلم|محمد (ص)]] باندې نازل شوی.  
# د الله تعالی په پرښتو باندې.(''[[پرښتې#د اسلام له نظره|ملايکه]]'').
# په قيامت او وروسته د مرګ نه د بيا ژوندي کېدلو عقيده (''[[قيامة]]'')  (په [[جنت]] او دوزخ عقيده). (يادونه: کله ناکله دغه وروستۍ موضوع باندې ځانګړی بحث کېږی, او په همدې توګه د عقيدې ارکان اوو ته رسېږي.)
# په قسمت عقيده([[تقدير]]).


د اسلام بنسټيزه عقيده په [[پښتو]] ژبه :
:: "زه شهادت ورکوم چې پرته د الله تعالی د ذات نه بل کوم ذات نه شته؛ او زه شهادت ورکوم چې محمد (صلی الله عليه وآله وسلم) د هغه پيغمبر دی."
:: "زه په الله تعالی ايمان راوړم؛ او د هغه په ملايکو؛ او د هغه په کتابونو؛ او د هغه په پيغمبرانو؛ او د محشر په ورځ؛ او په تقدير؛ او ټول شيان د الله تعالی له خوا نه دي، او پس د مرګ نه ژوندون حق دی."

===د اسلام پينځه بنسټونه===
''Main articles: [[Five Pillars of Islam]], [[Branches of Religion]], [[Roots of Religion]]''

[[Image:Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|The Pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]) to [[Kaaba]], [[Masjid al Haram]], Mecca, is one of the five pillars of Islam or one of the roots of religion (for the Shi'a).]]
د مسلمانانو دوه لويې فرقې سني او شعيه مسلمانان جوړوي. په اسلامي نړئ کې د شعيه ګانو په پرتله ډېرئ مسلمانان سنيان دي، خو په څينو هېوادونو کې لکه د منڅنئ آسيا هېوادونه ايران او عراق بيا شعيه مسلمانان ډېرکئ مذهبي ډله جوړوي. خو په نورو هېوادونو کط لکه سعودي عربستان، اندونيزيا او پاکستان کې سني مسلمان د هغه هېوادونو په مذهبي ټولنو کې ډېرکۍ برخه جوړوي.

Sunni Islam's fundamental tenets are referred to as the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]<sup>[[#Notes|2]]</sup>, while Shia Islam  has a slightly different terminology, encompassing five core beliefs, the [[Roots of Religion]] and ten core practices, the [[Branches of Religion]]. All Muslims agree on the following five basic obligations of believers, which Sunnis term the Five Pillars of Islam, and which Shia would consider to be elements of the Roots of Religion and the Branches of Religion. 

*[[شهادت]]: Testifying that there is none worthy of worship  except God ([[Tawheed]]) and that [[Muhammad]] is his servant and messenger ([[نبوت]]).
*[[لمونځ]]: هره ورځ پينځه وخته لمونځ کول.
*[[روژه]]: د روژې په مياشت کې د لمرخاته نه تر لمرپرېواته روژه نيول.
*[[زکات]]: زکات ورکول.
*[[حج]]: The Pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] during the month of ''Dhul Hijjah'', which is compulsory once in a lifetime for one who has the ability to do it.

شعيه او سنيان دواړه په لاندنيو ګروهو باندې باور لري، خو دغه دوه فرقې همدا عقايد په بېلابېلو ډلبنديو وېشي او هره ډله ورته ځانګړی تعبير لري:
*[[عدل]]: د الله عدل.
*[[قيامت]]: د خېر او شر د مالومولو ورځ.
*[[امر بل معروف]]: د ښو امر.
*[[نهي عن المنکر]]: د بدو نه ډډه.
*[[جهاد|الجهاد في سبيل الله]]: د الله تعالی د رضا لپاره هڅه کوشش او زيار.

Distinctive Shi'a beliefs, not held by the Sunni, include:
*[[امامت]]: Leadership. The belief in the divinely appointed and guided [[imam]]ate of [[Ali]] and some of his descendants.
*[[Tawalla]]: To love the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and their followers.
*[[Tabarra]]: To disassociate from the enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt.
*[[Khums]]: Paying the tax on profit.

Many Muslims, however, do not fall into any of the denominations listed above. These Muslims believe that the following extract from the Qu'ran bans the formation of sects within Islam, and therefore classify themselves as simply 'Muslims'.

"[6:159] Those who divide themselves into sects do not belong with you. Their judgment rests with GOD, then He will inform
them of everything they had done."

===خدای===
:''Main articles: [[الله]] / [[خدای]]
{{main|په اسلام کې د خدای انځور}}
{{داهم-وګورۍ|الله}}
The fundamental concept in Islam is the oneness of [[God]] (''[[tawhid]]''). This monotheism is absolute, not relative or  pluralistic in any sense of the word. God is described in [[Sura]] [[al-Ikhlas]], (chapter 112) as follows:

:''Say "He is God, the one and only. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute the Self-Sufficient master. He begetteth not, nor is he  begotten. And there is none like unto Him."

In Arabic, God is called ''Allāh''. The word is etymologically connected to ''ʾilāh'' "[[deity]]",  ''Allāh'' is also the word  used by Christian and Jewish Arabs, translating ''ho theos'' of the [[New Testament]] and [[Septuagint]]; it predates Muhammad and in its origin does not specify a "God" different from the one worshipped by Judaism and Christianity, the other [[Abrahamic]] religions.

The name "Allah" shows no plural or gender, unlike the word "God" that may take plural sense "Gods" and feminine form "Goddesses". In Islam "Allah" Almighty as the Qur’an says:

:''"(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things)" (42:11).

The implicit usage of the [[definite article]] in ''Allah'' linguistically indicates the divine unity. Muslims believe that the God they worship is the same as the Judeo-Christian God, i.e. the God of Abraham. However, Muslims reject the Christian theology concerning the trinity of God (the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] which regards Jesus as the eternal [[Son of God]]), seeing it as akin to [[polytheism]]. Quoting from the Qur'an,
[[sura]] [[An-Nisa]](4) :171:

:''"O People of the Scripture! Do not transgress the limits of your religion, and do not say about God except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was only a messenger of God, and His word that He had sent to Mary, and a revelation from Him. Therefore, you shall believe in GOD and His messengers. You shall not say, "Trinity". You shall refrain from this for your own good. God is only one God. Be He glorified; He is much too glorious to have a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. God suffices as Lord and Master."''

No Muslim visual images or depictions of God exist because such artistic depictions may lead to [[idolatry]] and are thus disdained. Such [[aniconism]] can also be found in Judeo-Christian theology. Moreover, most Muslims believe that God is [[Spiritual being|incorporeal]], making any two- or three- dimensional depictions impossible. Instead, Muslims describe God by the many [[99 Names of God|divine attributes]] mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]. All but one Sura (chapter) of the Qur'an begins with the phrase "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful". These are regarded as the most important divine attributes, at least in the sense that Muslims repeat them most frequently during their prayers ([[salat]]) and throughout their daily lives.


Islam's fundamental theological concept is ''[[tawhīd]]''—the belief that there is only one God. The Arabic term for God is ''Allāh''; most scholars believe it was derived from a contraction of the words ''[[al-]]'' (the) and ''{{ArabDIN|[[ʾilāh]]}}'' (deity, masculine form), meaning "the God" (''{{ArabDIN|al-ilāh}}''), but others trace its origin to the Aramaic ''Alāhā''.<ref>See:
* "Islam and Christianity", ''Encyclopedia of Christianity'' (2001): Arabic-speaking [[Christian]]s and [[Jew]]s also refer to God as ''Allāh''.
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Allah | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The first of the Five Pillars of Islam, ''tawhīd'' is expressed in the ''[[shahadah]]'' (testification), which declares that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is God's messenger. In traditional Islamic theology, God is beyond all comprehension; Muslims are not expected to visualize God but to worship and adore him as a protector. Although Muslims believe that [[Jesus]] was a prophet, they reject the Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]], comparing it to polytheism. In Islamic theology, [[Jesus]] was just a man and not the son of God;<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Tathlith, Trinity | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=David Thomas | accessdate=2007-05-11}}: Contrary to Muslim understanding, some scholars have suggested that the Qur'an only opposes certain deviant forms of Trinitarian belief.</ref> God is described in a chapter (''[[sura]]'') of the Qur'an as "…God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him."<ref>See:

===قران عظيم الشان===
{{Seealso|Origin and development of the Qur'an}}
[[Image:FirstSurahKoran.jpg|thumb|300px| <font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">د قرآن لومړنۍ سوره [[الفاتحه]] د قران عظيم شان د لاسي نسخې يو انځور.]]
{{main|قرآن}}

The Qur'an is the sacred book of Islam. It has also been called, in English, "the Koran" and (archaically) "the Alcoran". Qur'an is the currently preferred English transliteration of the Arabic original (&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606;); it means &#8220;recitation&#8221;. Although the Qur'an is referred to as a "book", when a Muslim refers to the Qur'an, they are referring to the actual text, the words, rather than the printed work itself.

Muslims believe that the Qur'an was revealed to the prophet [[Muhammad]] by God through the [[Gabriel (archangel)|Angel Gabriel]] on numerous occasions between the years [[610]] and up till his death in [[632]]. In addition to memorizing his revelations, his followers are said to have written them down on parchments, stones, and leaves.

Muslims hold that the Qur'an available today is the same as that revealed to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and by him to his followers, who memorized and wrote down his words. Scholars generally accept that the version of the Qur'an used today was first compiled in writing by the third [[Caliph]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]], sometime between [[650]] and [[656]]. He sent copies of his version to the various provinces of the new Muslim empire, and directed that all variant copies be destroyed. However, some skeptics doubt the recorded oral traditions ([[hadith]]) on which this account is based, and will concede only that the Qur'an must have been compiled before [[750]].

There are numerous traditions, and many conflicting academic theories, as to the provenance of the Qur'anic verses that were eventually assembled into a single volume. (This is covered in greater detail in [[Qur'an]]). Most Muslims accept the account recorded in several hadith, which state that [[Abu Bakr]], The First Caliph, ordered his personal secretary [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] to collect and record all the authentic verses of the Qur'an, as preserved in written form or oral tradition. Zayd's written collection, privately treasured by Prophet Muhammad's wife [[Hafsa bint Umar]], was, according to Muslim sources, later used by Uthman and is thus the basis of today's Qur'an.

Uthman's version, organized the suras roughly in order of length (excepting the brief opening surah [[Al-Fatiha]]), with the longest suras at the start of the Qur'an and the shortest ones at the end. More conservative views state that the order of most suras was divinely set. Later scholars have struggled to put the suras in chronological order, and among Muslim commentators, at least, there is a rough consensus as to which suras were revealed in [[Makkan sura|Mecca]] and which at [[Medinan sura|Medina]], with distinctive characteristics observed within these two subgroups. Some suras (e.g. surat [[Iqra]]) are thought to have been revealed in parts at separate times.

To understand the notion of "variants" within the received Qur'anic text, one must understand that Arabic had not yet fully developed as a written language. The Qur'an was first recorded in written form (date uncertain) in the [[Hijazi]], [[Mashq]], [[Ma'il]], and [[Kufic]] scripts; these scripts write consonants only and do not supply vowels. (Imagine an English text that wrote the word 'bed' as "BD," and required the reader to infer, from context, that the reference was to "bed" - and not to 'bad" or "bide.") Because there were differing oral traditions of recitation as non-native Arabic speakers converted to Islam, there was some disagreement as to the exact reading of many (vowel-free) verses. Eventually, scripts were  developed that used diacritical markings (known as ''points'') to indicate the vowels. For hundreds of years after Uthman's recension, Muslim scholars argued as to the correct pointing and reading of Uthman's (unpointed) official text.{{citation needed}} Eventually, most commentators accepted seven variant readings ([[qira'at]]) of the Qur'an as canonical, while agreeing that the differences among the seven are minor and do not affect the meaning of the text.

The form of the Qur'an most used today is the [[Al-Azhar]] text of 1923, prepared by a committee at the prestigious [[Cairo]] university of Al-Azhar.

The Qur'an early became a focus of Muslim devotion and eventually a subject of theological controversy among skeptics. In the [[8th century]], the [[Mu'tazili]]s claimed that the Qur'an was created in time and was not eternal. Their opponents, of various schools, claimed that the Qur'an was eternal and perfect, existing in heaven before it was revealed to Muhammad. The [[Ashari]] theology (which ultimately became predominant) held that the Qur'an was uncreated.

Most Muslims regard paper copies of the Qur'an with extreme veneration, wrapping them in a clean cloth, keeping them on a high shelf, and washing as for prayers before reading the Qur'an. Old Qur'ans are not destroyed as wastepaper, but burned.

Most Muslims memorize for personal contact at least some portion of the Qur'an in the  original language. Those who have memorized the entire Qur'an are known as [[hafiz]]. This is not a rare achievement; it is believed that there are millions of [[huffaz]] (plural) alive today.

From the beginning of the faith, most Muslims believed that the Qur'an was perfect only as revealed in Arabic. Translations were the result of human effort and human fallibility, as well as lacking the inspired poetry believers find in the Qur'an. Translations are therefore only commentaries on the Qur'an, or "translations of its meaning", not the Qur'an itself. Many modern, printed versions of the Qur'an feature the Arabic text on one page, and a vernacular translation on the facing page.

Muslims consider the Qur'an to be the literal word of God; it is the central [[religious text]] of Islam.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an| encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> Muslims believe that the verses of the Qur'an were revealed to Muhammad by God through the angel Gabriel on many occasions between the years 610 and his death on [[July 6]] [[632]]. The Qur'an was written down by Muhammad's companions (''[[sahabah]]'') while he was alive, although the prime method of transmission was orally. It was compiled in the time of [[Abu Bakr]], the first [[caliph]], and was standardized in the time of [[Uthman]], the third caliph. From textual evidence, modern Western academics find that the Qur'an of today has not changed over the years.<ref>See:

*F. E. Peters (1991), pp.3–5: "Few have failed to be convinced that … the Quran is … the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation."</ref> 

The Qur'an is divided into 114 [[sura]]s, or chapters, which combined, contain 6,236 ''[[ayah|āyāt]]'', or poetic verses. The chronologically earlier suras, revealed at Mecca, are primarily concerned with ethical and spiritual topics. The later Medinan suras mostly discuss social and moral issues relevant to the Muslim community.<ref>See:

The word ''Qur'an'' means "recitation". When Muslims speak in the abstract about "the Qur'an", they usually mean the scripture as recited in Arabic rather than the printed work or any translation of it. To Muslims, the Qur'an is perfect only as revealed in the original Arabic; translations are necessarily deficient because of language differences, the fallibility of translators, and the impossibility of preserving the original's inspired style. Translations are therefore regarded only as commentaries on the Qur'an, or "interpretations of its meaning", not as the Qur'an itself.<ref>See:

Belief in angels is crucial to the faith of Islam. The Arabic word for Angels (''malak'') means "messenger", like its counterparts in Hebrew (''malakh'') and Greek (''angelos''). According to the Qur'an, angels do not possess [[free will]], and worship God in perfect obedience.<ref>{{cite quran|21|19|end=20|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|35|1|style=ref}}</ref> Angels' duties include communicating revelations from God, glorifying God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's soul at the time of death.

{{main|Muhammad}}

Muhammad (c. 570 – [[July 6]] [[632]]) was an Arab religious, political, and military leader who founded the religion of Islam as a historical phenomenon. Muslims view him not as the creator of a new religion, but as the restorer of the original, uncorrupted monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham and others. In Muslim tradition, Muhammad is viewed as the last and the greatest in a series of [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]—as the man closest to perfection, the possessor of all virtues.<ref>See:

[[Image:Masjid Nabawi. Medina, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] ("Mosque of the Prophet") in [[Medina]] is the site of Muhammad's tomb.]]

During this time, Muhammad preached to the people of [[Mecca]], imploring them to abandon polytheism. Although some converted to Islam, Muhammad and his followers were persecuted by the leading Meccan authorities. After 13 years of preaching, Muhammad and the Muslims performed the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' ("emigration") to the city of [[Medina]] (formerly known as ''Yathrib'')  in 622. There, with the Medinan converts (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'') and the Meccan migrants (''[[Muhajirun]]''), Muhammad established his political and [[Theocracy|religious authority]]. Within years, two battles had been fought against Meccan forces: the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624, which was a Muslim victory, and the [[Battle of Uhud]] in 625, which ended inconclusively. Conflict with Medinan Jewish clans who opposed the Muslims led to their exile, enslavement or death, and the Jewish enclave of [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] was subdued. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control.<ref>See:
* F.E.Peters(2003), pp.78,79,194

In Islam, the "[[normative]]" example of Muhammad's life is called the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (literally "trodden path"). This example is preserved in traditions known as [[hadith]] ("reports"), which recount his words, his actions, and his personal characteristics. The classical Muslim jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]] (d. 820) emphasized the importance of the Sunnah in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], and Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's actions in their daily lives. The Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Qur'an.<ref>See:

Belief in the "Day of Resurrection", ''[[Qiyamah|yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' (also known as ''yawm ad-dīn'', "Day of Judgment" and ''as-sā`a'', "the Last Hour") is also crucial for Muslims. They believe that the time of ''Qiyāmah'' is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and [[tribulation]]s preceding and during the ''Qiyāmah'' are described in the Qur'an and the [[hadith]], and also in the commentaries of [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]]s. The Qur'an emphasizes [[Resurrection of the Dead|bodily resurrection]], a break from the [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n understanding of death. It states that resurrection will be followed by the gathering of mankind, culminating in their judgment by God.<ref>See:

The Qur'an lists several sins that can condemn a person to hell, such as disbelief, [[riba|usury]] and dishonesty. Muslims view paradise (''[[jannah]]'') as a place of joy and bliss, with Qur'anic references describing its features and the physical pleasures to come. There are also references to a greater joy—acceptance by God (''ridwān'').<ref>{{cite quran|9|72|style=ref}}</ref> Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God.<ref>See:

===تقدير===
{{main|Predestination in Islam|Adalah}}

In accordance with the Islamic belief in [[predestination]], or divine preordainment (''al-qadā wa'l-qadar''), God has full knowledge and control over all that occurs. This is explained in Qur'anic verses such as "Say: 'Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector'…"<ref>See:
* {{cite quran|9|51|style=ref}}
* D. Cohen-Mor (2001), p.4: "The idea of predestination is reinforced by the frequent mention of events 'being written' or 'being in a book' before they happen: 'Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us…"&nbsp;'&nbsp;"
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Fate | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Ahmet T. Karamustafa | accessdate=2007-05-02}}: The verb ''qadara'' literally means "to measure, to determine". Here it is used to mean that "God measures and orders his creation".</ref> For Muslims, everything in the world that occurs, good or evil, has been preordained and nothing can happen unless permitted by God. In Islamic theology, divine preordainment does not suggest an absence of God's indignation against evil, because any evils that do occur are thought to result in future benefits men may not be able to see. According to Muslim theologians, although events are pre-ordained, man possesses free will in that he has the faculty to choose between right and wrong, and is thus responsible for his actions. According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in ''al-Lawh al-Mahfūz'', the "Preserved Tablet".<ref>See:
* Farah (2003), pp.119–122
* Patton (1900), p.130</ref>

The Shi'a understanding of predestination is called "divine justice" (''Adalah''). This doctrine, originally developed by the [[Mu'tazila]], stresses the importance of man's responsibility for his own actions. In contrast, the Sunni deemphasize the role of individual free will in the context of God's creation and foreknowledge of all things.<ref>Momen (1987), pp.177,178</ref>

===Islamic eschatology===
{{main|Islamic eschatology}}

Islamic [[eschatology]] is concerned with the ''[[Qiyamah]]'' ([[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]) and the final  judgment of humanity. Like [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], Islam teaches the bodily [[resurrection]] of the dead, the fulfilment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul. In Islamic belief, the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of ''Jannah'' ([[Paradise]]), while the unrighteous are punished in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (a fiery [[Hell]], from the Hebrew ''ge-hinnom'' or "valley of Hinnom"; usually rendered in English as [[Gehenna]]). A significant portion of the Qur'an deals with these beliefs, with many ''[[hadith]]'' elaborating on the themes and details.

===اسلامي قانون===
{{main|شريعت|فقه}}
The Sharia is Islamic law, as elaborated by Islamic scholarship. The [[Qur'an]] is the foremost source of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. The second is the [[sunnah]] of Muhammad and the early Muslim community. The sunnah is not itself a text like the Qur'an, but is extracted by analysis of the [[hadith]] (Arabic for "report"), or recorded oral traditions, which contain narrations of the Muhammad's sayings, deeds, and actions. [[Ijma]] (consensus of the community of Muslims) and [[qiyas]] (analogical reasoning) are the third and fourth sources of Sharia.

Islamic law covers all aspects of life, from the broad topics of governance and foreign relations all the way down to issues of daily living. Islamic laws which were covered expressly in the Qur'an were referred to as ''hudud'' laws. This covered the prohibition of murder, extra-marital sex, drinking of alcohol and gambling. The Qur'an also details laws of inheritance, marriage, restitution for injuries and murder, as well as rules for fasting, charity, and prayer. However, the prescriptions and prohibitions may be broad, so how they are applied in practice varies. Islamic scholars, ''the ulema'', have elaborated systems of law on the basis of these broad rules, supplemented by the hadith reports of how Muhammad and his companions interpreted them. See [[Sin]] for further discussion about the concept of sin and its atonement according to the Islamic law.

In current times, not all Muslims understand the Qur'an in its original Arabic. Thus, when Muslims are divided in how to handle situations, they seek the assistance of a [[mufti]] (Islamic judge) who can advise them based on Islamic [[Sharia]] and hadith.

The ''Sharia'' (literally: "the path leading to the watering place") is Islamic law formed by traditional Islamic scholarship. In Islam, Sharia is the expression of the divine will, and "constitutes a system of duties that are incumbent upon a Muslim by virtue of his religious belief".<ref name="BritannicaShariah">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref>

Islamic law covers all aspects of life, from matters of state, like governance and [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]], to issues of daily living. The Qur'an defines ''[[hudud]]'' as the punishments for five specific crimes: unlawful intercourse, false accusation of unlawful intercourse, consumption of alcohol, theft, and highway robbery. The Qur'an and Sunnah also contain laws of [[Islamic Inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]], [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|marriage]], and [[Qisas|restitution for injuries and murder]], as well as rules for [[sawm|fasting]], [[Sadaqah|charity]], and [[salat|prayer]]. However, these [[wajib|prescriptions]] and [[Haraam|prohibitions]] may be broad, so their application in practice varies. [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] (known as ''ulema'') have elaborated systems of law on the basis of these rules and their interpretations.<ref>See:

''[[Fiqh]]'', or "jurisprudence", is defined as the knowledge of the practical rules of the religion. The method Islamic jurists use to derive rulings is known as ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' ("legal theory", or "principles of jurisprudence"). According to Islamic legal theory, law has four fundamental roots, which are given precedence in this order: the Qur'an, the Sunnah (actions and sayings of Muhammad), the consensus of the Muslim jurists (''[[ijma]]''), and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]''). For early Islamic jurists, theory was less important than pragmatic application of the law. In the 9th century, the jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]] provided a theoretical basis for Islamic law by codifying the principles of jurisprudence (including the four fundamental roots) in his book ''ar-Risālah''.<ref>Weiss (2002), pp.xvii,162</ref>

====مذهب او رياست====

Islamic law does not distinguish between "matters of church" and "matters of state"; the ulema function as both jurists and theologians. In practice, Islamic rulers frequently bypassed the Sharia courts with a parallel system of so-called "Grievance courts" over which they had sole control. As the Muslim world came into contact with Western secular ideals, Muslim societies responded in different ways. [[Turkey]] has been governed as a secular state ever since the reforms of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. In contrast, the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]] replaced a mostly secular regime with an [[Islamic republic]] led by the [[Ruholla Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini]].<ref>See:

==Denominations==
{{main|Divisions of Islam}}
Islam consists of a number of [[religious denomination]]s that are essentially similar in belief but which have significant theological and legal differences. The primary division is between the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and the [[Shi'a]], with [[Sufi]]sm generally considered to be a mystical inflection of Islam rather than a distinct school. According to most sources, approximately 85% of the world's Muslims are Sunni and approximately 15% are Shi'a, with a small minority who are members of other [[Islamic sects]].<ref>See:

{{main|سني}}
[[Sunni]] Muslims are the largest group in Islam. In [[Arabic]], ''as-Sunnah'' literally means "principle" or "path". The Sunnah (the example of Muhammad's life) as recorded in the Qur'an and the hadith is the main pillar of Sunni doctrine. Sunnis believe that the first four [[caliph]]s were the rightful successors to Muhammad; since God did not specify any particular leaders to succeed him, those leaders had to be elected. Sunnis recognize four major legal traditions, or [[madhhab]]s: [[Hanafi]],  [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]]. All four accept the validity of the others and a Muslim might choose any one that he or she finds agreeable, but other Islamic sects are believed to have departed from the majority by introducing innovations (''[[bidah]]''). There are also several orthodox theological or philosophical traditions within Sunnism. For example, the recent [[Salafi]] movement sees itself as restorationist and claims to derive its teachings from the original sources of Islam.<ref>See:

[[Image:Dome_of_the_rock_distance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A view of the [[Dome of the Rock]] on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]], a holy site in Islam]]
[[Shi'a]] Muslims, the second-largest sect, differ from the Sunni in rejecting the authority of the first three caliphs. They honor different traditions ([[hadith]]) and have their own legal traditions. Shi'a scholars have a larger authority than Sunni scholars and have greater room for interpretation. The [[Imams]] play a central role in Shi'a doctrine. 

The arabic word Shi'a, litarally translates into the word 'group' or 'sect'. Originally known as Shi'at Ali (the sect of Ali), the group formed shortly after the death of Ali, in [[Iraq]]. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the cousin of prophet [[Muhammad]], and after marriage to Fatima, he also became Muhammad's son-in-law.

The Shi'a consist of one major school of thought known as the [[Ithna 'ashariyah]] or the "[[Twelvers]]", and a few minor schools of thought, as the "Seveners" or the "Fivers" referring to the number of infallible leaders they recognize after the death of prophet [[Muhammad]]. The term Shi'a, when used without qualification, is usually taken to be synonymous with the Ithna Ashariyya or Twelvers. Most Shi'a live in [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] (the country where Ali passed away), [[Bahrain]], [[Lebanon]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. A minority group (about 4 million) of Shi'a is known as [[Ismaili]]. The Shia Ismaili sect is subdivided into [[Nizari]] Ismaili and [[Mustaali]] Bohra subsects. The Nizari Ismaili or are led by the [[Aga Khan]] and are found mainly in [[Pakistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Bangladesh]], India, Canada and United States. The [[Mustaali]] Bohra sect is further subdivded into Dawoodi and Sulaimanis subsects. The [[Dawoodi Bohra]]s are concentrated in Pakistan and India. The [[Sulaimani Bohra]]s are concentrated in Yemen and Najran province of Saudi Arabia.

===صوفيت===
{{main|Sufism}}

Not strictly a denomination, [[Sufism]] is a mystical-ascetic form of Islam. By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of "intuitive and emotional faculties" that one must be trained to use.<ref>Trimingham (1998), p.1</ref> Sufism and [[Islamic law]] are usually considered to be complementary, although Sufism has been criticized by some Muslims for being an unjustified [[bidah|religious innovation]]. Most Sufi orders, or ''[[tariqa]]s'', can be classified as either Sunni or Shi'a.<ref>See:
* Esposito (2003), p.302
* Malik (2006), p.3
* B. S. Turner (1998), p.145

[[Sufism]] is a spiritual practice followed by both Sunni and Shi'a. Sufis generally feel that following Islamic law or jurisprudence (or ''fiqh'') is only the first step on the path to perfect submission; they focus on the internal or more spiritual aspects of Islam, such as perfecting one's faith and fighting one's own ego (''nafs''). Most Sufi orders, or [[tariqa]], can be classified as either Sunni or Shi'a. However, there are some that are not easily categorized as either Sunni or Shi'a, such as the [[Bektashi]]. Sufis are found throughout the Islamic world, from [[Senegal]] to [[Indonesia]].

===نورې طريقې===
[[Wahhabi]]s, as they are known by non-Wahhabis, are a smaller, more recent Sunni group. They prefer to be called [[Salafi]]s. Wahhabism is a movement founded by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab]] in the [[18th century]] in what is present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. They classify themselves as Sunni and some claim to follow the [[Hanbali]] legal tradition. The major trend, however, is the  abolition of these "schools of thoughts" (legal traditions), and the following of a more literalist interpretation. Some even regard other Sunni as heretics. The [[Hanbali]] legal tradition is the recognized official school of Islamic law in Saudi Arabia and they have had a great deal of influence on the Islamic world because of Saudi control of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the Islamic holy places, and because of Saudi funding for mosques and schools in other countries. The majority of Saudi Islamic scholars are considered as [[Wahhabi]]s by other parts of the Islamic world. 

Sunni and Shi'a have often clashed. Some Sunni believe that Shi'a  are heretics while other Sunni recognize Shi'a as fellow Muslims. According to Shaikh Mahmood Shaltoot, head of the [[al-Azhar University]] in the middle part of the 20th century, "the Ja'fari school of thought, which is also known as "al-Shi'a al- Imamiyyah al-Ithna Ashariyyah" (i.e. The Twelver Imami Shi'ites) is a school of thought that is religiously correct to follow in worship as are other Sunni schools of thought". Al-Azhar later distanced itself from this position.

Another sect which dates back to the early days of Islam is that of the [[Kharijites]]. The only surviving branch of the Kharijites are the [[Ibadi|Ibadhi Muslim]]s. Ibadhism is distinguished from Shiism by its belief that the Imam (Leader) should be chosen solely on the basis of his faith, not on the basis of descent, and from Sunnism in its rejection of [[Uthman]] and [[Ali]] and strong emphasis on the need to depose unjust rulers.  Ibadhi Islam is noted for its strictness, but, unlike the Kharijites proper, Ibadhis do not regard major sins as automatically making a Muslim an unbeliever. Most Ibadhi Muslims live in [[Oman]].

Another trend in modern Islam is that which is sometimes called progressive. Followers may be called [[Ijtihadists]]. They may be either Sunni or Shi'ite, and generally favor the development of  personal interpretations of Qur'an and Hadith. ''See'': [[Liberal Islam]]

One very small group, based primarily in the United States, follows the teachings of [[Rashad Khalifa]] and calls itself the "Submitters". They reject [[hadith]] and [[fiqh]], and say that they follow the Qur'an alone. Most Muslims of both the [[Sunni]] and the [[Shia]] sects consider this group to be heretical.

The [[Kharijites]] are a sect that dates back to the early days of Islam. The only surviving branch of the Kharijites is [[Ibadism]]. Unlike most Kharijite groups, Ibadism does not regard sinful Muslims as unbelievers. The [[Imam]]ate is an important topic in Ibadi legal literature, which stipulates that the leader should be chosen solely on the basis of his knowledge and piety, and is to be deposed if he acts unjustly. Most Ibadi Muslims live in [[Oman]].<ref>See:

{{main|Islam and other religions}}

The Qur'an contains injunctions to respect other religions. It also asks the followers to fight and subdue unbelievers in times of war and "evict them whence they evicted you" (Al-Qur'an 2:191). Some Muslims have respected Jews and Christians as fellow "peoples of the book" (monotheists following [[Abrahamic religions]]), while others have reviled them as having abandoned monotheism and corrupted their scriptures. At different times and places, Islamic communities have been both intolerant and tolerant.

The classical Islamic solution was a limited tolerance &mdash; Jews and Christians were to be allowed to privately practice their faith and follow their own family law. They were called [[Dhimmis]], and they had fewer though similar legal rights and obligations than Muslims.

The classic Islamic state was often more tolerant than many other states of the time, which insisted on complete conformity to a state religion. The record of contemporary Muslim-majority states is mixed. Some are generally regarded as tolerant, while others have been accused of intolerance and human rights violations. See the main article, [[Islam and other religions]], for further discussion.



==Duties and practices==
===Five Pillars===
{{main|Five Pillars of Islam}}

[[Image:Arabic Plaque, Great Mosque, Xian.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Islam's basic creed (''[[shahadah]]'') written on a plaque in the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], [[China]]]]
[[Image:Kabaa.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Rituals of the [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage) include walking seven times around the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca.]]

[[The Five Pillars of Islam]] (Arabic: : اركان الدين) are five practices essential to Sunni Islam. Shi'a Muslims subscribe to eight ritual practices which substantially overlap with the Five Pillars.<ref>See:
* Momem (1987), p.178
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Pillars of Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> They are: 

* The '''''[[shahadah]]''''', which is the basic creed or tenet of Islam: "''{{ArabDIN|'ašhadu 'al-lā ilāha illā-llāhu wa 'ašhadu 'anna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh}}''", or "I testify that there is none worthy of worship except God and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God." This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam (although technically the Shi'a do not consider the ''shahadah'' to be a separate pillar, just a belief). Muslims must repeat the ''shahadah'' in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.<ref>See:
* Farah (1994), p.135
* Momen (1987), p.178
* "Islam", ''Encyclopedia of Religious Rites, Rituals, and Festivals''(2004)</ref>

* '''''[[Salah]]''''', or ritual prayer, which must be performed five times a day. (However, the Shi'a are permitted to run together the noon with the afternoon prayers, and the evening with the night prayers). Each salah is done facing towards the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca. Salah is intended to focus the mind on God, and is seen as a personal communication with him that expresses gratitude and worship. Salah is compulsory but flexibility in the specifics is allowed depending on circumstances. In many Muslim countries, reminders called [[Adhan]] (call to prayer) are broadcast publicly from local mosques at the appropriate times. The prayers are recited in the [[Arabic language]], and consist of verses from the Qur'an.<ref>See:
* Esposito (2002b), pp.18,19
* Hedáyetullah (2006), pp.53–55
* Kobeisy (2004), pp.22–34
* Momen (1987), p.178</ref>

* '''''[[Zakat]]''''', or [[alms|alms-giving]]. This is the practice of giving based on accumulated wealth, and is obligatory for all Muslims who can afford it. A fixed portion is spent to help the poor or needy, and also to assist the spread of Islam. The zakat is considered a religious obligation (as opposed to voluntary charity) that the well-off owe to the needy because their wealth is seen as a "trust from God's bounty". The Qur'an and the hadith also suggest a Muslim give even more as an act of voluntary alms-giving (''[[sadaqah]]''). Many Shi'ites are expected to pay an additional amount in the form of a ''[[khums]]'' tax, which they consider to be a separate ritual practice.<ref>See:
* {{cite quran|2|177|style=ref}}
* Esposito (2004), p.90

* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Zakat | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref>

* '''''[[Sawm]]''''', or [[Sawm of Ramadan|fasting during the month of Ramadan]]. Muslims must not eat or drink (among other things) from dawn to dusk during this month, and must be mindful of other sins. The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God, and during it Muslims should express their gratitude for and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and think of the needy. ''Sawm'' is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would constitute an undue burden. For others, flexibility is allowed depending on circumstances, but missed fasts usually must be made up quickly.<ref>See:
* {{cite quran|2|184|style=ref}}

* The '''''[[Hajj]]''''', which is the pilgrimage during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah]]'' in the city of [[Mecca]]. Every [[able-bodied]] Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. When the pilgrim is about ten kilometers from Mecca, he must dress in [[Ihram clothing|''Ihram'' clothing]], which consists of two white seamless sheets. Rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the [[Kaaba]], touching the [[Black Stone]], running seven times between [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Safa]] and [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Marwah]], and symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]]. The pilgrim, or the ''hajji'', is honored in his or her community, although Islamic teachers say that the Hajj should be an expression of devotion to God instead of a means to gain social standing.<ref>See:
* Farah (1994), pp.145–147
* Goldschmidt (2005), p.48
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Hajj | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref>

In addition to the ''khums'' tax, Shi'a Muslims consider three additional practices essential to the religion of Islam. The first is [[jihad]], which is also important to the Sunni, but not considered a pillar. The second is ''[[Amr-Bil-Ma'rūf]]'', the "Enjoining to Do Good", which calls for every Muslim to live a virtuous life and to encourage others to do the same. The third is ''[[Nahi-Anil-Munkar]]'', the "Exhortation to Desist from Evil", which tells Muslims to refrain from vice and from evil actions and to also encourage others to do the same.<ref>Momen (1987), p.180</ref>



===Etiquette and diet===

{{Main|Adab (behavior)|Islamic dietary laws}}

Many practices fall in the category of ''adab'', or Islamic etiquette. This includes greeting others with "''[[As-Salamu Alaykum|as-salamu `alaykum]]''" ("peace be unto you"), saying ''[[bismillah]]'' ("in [[Names of God|the name of God]]") before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking. [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|Islamic hygienic]] practices mainly fall into the category of personal cleanliness and health, such as the circumcision of male offspring. [[Islamic funeral|Islamic burial rituals]] include saying the ''[[Salat al-Janazah]]'' ("funeral prayer") over the bathed and enshrouded dead body, and burying it in a grave. Muslims, like Jews, are restricted in their diet, and prohibited foods include pig products, blood, [[carrion]], and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. All meat must come from a [[herbivorous]] animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself. Food permissible for Muslims is known as [[halal]] food.<ref>See:

===جهاد===
{{mainarticle|Jihad|Islamic military jurisprudence}}
Jihad means "to strive or struggle," especially in the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of God" (''al-jihad fi sabil Allah'') and is considered the "[[sixth pillar of Islam]]" by a minority of Muslim authorities.<ref>See:
*Merriam (1999) p.571
*Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia p.419
* Esposito (2003), p.93</ref> Jihad, in its broadest sense, is classically defined as "exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation." Depending on the object being a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self, different categories of Jihad are defined: Jihad against one's own self (self-perfection), Jihad of the tongue, Jihad of the hand, and Jihad of the sword. Jihad when used without any qualifier is understood in its military aspect.<ref> Reuven Firestone (1999), The Meaning of Jihād, p. 17-18 </ref><ref> Britannica Encyclopedia, Jihad </ref>

Jihad is the only form of warfare permissible under [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Under most circumstances and for most Muslims, jihad is a collective duty (''[[Fard|fard kifaya]]''): one whose performance by some individuals exempts the others; for the rest of the populace, this happens only in the case of a [[general mobilization]].<ref>"Djihad", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.</ref> Some Muslim authorities, especially among the Shi'a and [[Sufism|Sufis]], distinguish between the "greater jihad", which pertains to spiritual self-perfection, and the "lesser jihad", defined as warfare.<ref>See:
*Firestone (1999) p.17 
*"Djihad", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.</ref> Jihad also refers to one's striving to attain religious and moral perfection.<ref>See:

==تاريخ==
{{main|Muslim history|Spread of Islam}}

Islam's historical development resulted in major political, economic, and military effects inside and outside the [[Islamic world]]. Within a century of Muhammad's first recitations of the [[Qur'an]], an Islamic empire stretched from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to [[Central Asia]] in the east. This new polity soon broke into civil war, and successor states fought each other and outside forces. However, Islam continued to spread into regions like [[Africa]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. The Islamic civilization was one of the most advanced in the world during the [[Middle Ages]], but was surpassed by Europe with the economic and military growth of the West. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Islamic dynasties such as the [[Ottomans]] and [[Mughals]] fell under the sway of European imperial powers. In the 20th century [[Islamic revival|new religious and political movements]] and newfound wealth in the Islamic world led to both rebirth and conflict.<ref>See:

===د اسلامي رياست پيل (632–750)===
{{see|Succession to Muhammad|Muslim conquests|Muslim Empire}}
Muhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or "Wars of Apostasy".<ref>See:

[[Image:Age of Caliphs.png|thumb|left|300px|The territory of the [[Caliphate]] in the year 750]]

His death in 634 resulted in the succession of Umar as the caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and Ali ibn Abi Talib. These four are known as ''al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn'' ("[[Rightly Guided Caliphs]]"). Under them, the territory under Muslim rule expanded deeply into [[Persian Empire]] and [[Byzantine]] territories.<ref>See
* Holt (1977a), p.74
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | coauthors=J. Jomier | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> When Umar was assassinated in 644, [[the election of Uthman]] as successor was met with increasing opposition. In 656, Uthman was also killed, and Ali assumed the position of caliph. After fighting off opposition in the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] (the "First Fitna"), Ali was assassinated by [[Kharijites]] in 661. Following this, [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiyah]], who was governor of [[Levant]], seized power and began the [[Umayyad dynasty]].<ref>Holt (1977a), pp.67–72</ref>

These disputes over religious and political leadership would give rise to schism in the Muslim community. The majority accepted the legitimacy of the three rulers prior to Ali, and became known as [[Sunni]]s. A minority disagreed, and believed that Ali was the only rightful successor; they became known as the [[Shi'a]].<ref>Waines (2003) p.46</ref> After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflict over succession broke out again in a civil war known as the "[[Second Fitna]]". Afterward, the Umayyad dynasty prevailed for seventy years, and was able to conquer the [[Maghreb|Maghrib]] as well as the [[Al-Andalus]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]], former [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]]) and the [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonnese Gaul]]. While the Muslim-Arab elite engaged in conquest, some devout Muslims<!--The Islamic term is Zahid and there may be a better translation for it.--> began to question the piety of indulgence in a worldly life, emphasizing rather poverty, humility and avoidance of sin based on renunciation of bodily desires. Devout Muslim ascetic exemplars such as [[Hasan al-Basri]] would inspire a movement that would evolve into [[Sufism]].<ref>See:
* Lapidus (2002), pp.90,91
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Sufism | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

For the Umayyad aristocracy, Islam was viewed as a religion for Arabs only;<ref>Hawting (2000), p.4</ref> the economy of the Umayyad empire was based on the assumption that a majority of non-Muslims ([[Dhimmis]]) would pay taxes to the minority of Muslim Arabs. A non-Arab who wanted to convert to Islam was supposed to first become a client of an Arab tribe. Even after conversion, these new Muslims (''[[mawali]]'') did not achieve social and economic equality with the Arabs. The descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] rallied discontented ''mawali'', poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them with the help of their propagandist and general [[Abu Muslim]], inaugurating the [[Abbasid|Abbasid dynasty]] in 750.<ref>Lapidus (2002), p.56; Lewis (1993), pp. 71&ndash;83</ref> Under the Abbasids, Islamic civilization flourished in the "[[Islamic Golden Age]]", with its capital at the cosmopolitan city of Baghdad.<ref>See:

By the late 9th century, the Abbasid caliphate began to fracture as various regions gained increasing levels of autonomy. Across North Africa, Persia, and Central Asia [[emirates]] formed as provinces broke away. The monolithic Arab empire gave way to a more religiously homogenized [[Muslim world]] where the Shia [[Fatimid]]s contested even the religious authority of the caliphate. By 1055 the [[Seljuq Turks]] had eliminated the Abbasids as a military power, nevertheless they continued to respect the caliph's titular authority.<ref>See:

The Golden Age saw new legal, philosophical, and religious developments. The [[Six major Hadith collections|major hadith collections]] were compiled and the four modern Sunni [[Madh'hab]]s were established. Islamic law was advanced greatly by the efforts of the early 9th century jurist [[al-Shafi'i]]; he codified a method to establish the reliability of hadith, a topic which had been a locus of dispute among Islamic scholars.<ref>Lapidus (2002), p.86</ref> Philosophers [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) and [[Al-Farabi]] sought to incorporate Greek principles into Islamic theology, while others like the 11th century theologian [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazzali]] argued against them and ultimately prevailed.<ref>See:

* Waines (2003) p.126,127</ref> Finally, Sufism and Shi'ism both underwent major changes in the 9th century. [[Sufism]] became a full-fledged movement that had moved towards mysticism and away from its ascetic roots, while Shi'ism split due to disagreements over the succession of Imams.<ref>See:

The spread of the Islamic dominion induced hostility among [[Middle ages|medieval]] [[ecclesiastical]] Christian authors who saw Islam as an adversary in the light of the large numbers of new Muslim converts. This opposition resulted in polemical treatises which depicted Islam as the religion of the [[antichrist]] and of Muslims as libidinous and subhuman.<ref>Tolan (2002) xv, xvi, 41</ref> In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], a few Arab philosophers like the poet [[Al-Ma'arri]] adopted a critical approach to Islam, and the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] contrasted Islamic views of morality to Jewish views that he himself elaborated.<ref>See:

Starting in the 9th century, Muslim conquests in Christian Europe began to be reversed. The [[Reconquista]] was launched against Muslim [[Taifa|principalities]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and Muslim [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Italian possessions]] were lost to the [[Normans]]. From the 11th century onwards a series of wars known as the [[Crusade]]s brought the Muslim world into conflict with [[Christendom]].

The Seljuk Turks fell apart rapidly in the second half of the 13th century. In the 13th and 14th centuries the [[Ottoman empire]] (named after [[Osman I]]) was established with a string of conquests that included the [[Balkans]], parts of [[Greece]], and western [[Anatolia]]. In 1453 under [[Mehmed II]] the Ottomans laid siege to [[Constantinople]], the capital of Byzantium.

Beginning in the 13th century, Sufism underwent a transformation, largely as a result of the efforts of [[al-Ghazzali]] to legitimize and reorganize the movement. He developed the model of the Sufi order—a community of spiritual teachers and students.<ref>Esposito (2004), pp.104,105</ref> Also of importance to Sufism was the creation of the [[Masnavi]], a collection of mystical poetry by the 13th century [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]].

Groups such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt and [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] in Pakistan advocate a totalistic and theocratic alternative to secular political ideologies. Sometimes called [[Islamist]], they see Western cultural values as a threat, and promote Islam as a comprehensive solution to every public and private question of importance. In countries like Iran and Afghanistan (under the [[Taliban]]), revolutionary movements replaced [[Secularism|secular]] regimes with Islamist states, while transnational groups like [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[al-Qaeda]] engage in [[Islamist terrorism|terrorism]] to further their goals. In contrast, [[Liberal Islam]] is a movement that attempts to reconcile religious tradition with modern norms of secular governance and [[human rights]]. Its supporters say that there are multiple ways to read Islam's sacred texts, and stress the need to leave room for "independent thought on religious matters".<ref>See:

Commonly cited estimates of the Muslim population in 2007 range from 1.1&nbsp;billion to 1.8&nbsp;billion. Approximately 85% are [[Sunni]] and 15% are [[Shi'a]], with a small minority belonging to other sects. Some 30–40 countries are Muslim-majority, and Arabs account for around 20% of all Muslims worldwide.

A mosque is a [[places of worship|place of worship]] for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name, ''masjid''. The word ''mosque'' in English refers to all types of buildings dedicated to Islamic worship, although there is a distinction in Arabic between the smaller, privately owned mosque and the larger, "collective" mosque (''masjid jāmi`''). Although the primary purpose of the mosque is to serve as a place of prayer, it is also important to the [[ummah|Muslim community]] as a place to meet and study. Modern mosques have evolved greatly from the early designs of the 7th century, and contain a variety of architectural elements such as [[minaret]]s.<ref>See:

The basic unit of Islamic society is the [[family]], and Islam defines the obligations and legal rights of family members. The father is seen as financially responsible for his family, and is obliged to cater for their well-being. The division of [[inheritance]] is specified in the Qur'an, which states that most of it is to pass to the immediate family, while a portion is set aside for the payment of debts and the making of bequests. The woman's share of inheritance is generally half of that of a man with the same rights of succession.<ref>"al-Mar'a". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> [[Marriage in Islam]] is a civil [[nikah|contract]] which consists of an offer and acceptance between two qualified parties in the presence of two witnesses. The groom is required to pay a [[dowry]] (''[[mahr]]'') to the bride, as stipulated in the contract.<ref>

A man may marry up to four wives if he believes he can treat them equally, while a woman may marry one man only. In most Muslim countries, the process of divorce in Islam is known as ''[[Talaq (Nikah)|talaq]]'', which the husband initiates by pronouncing the word "divorce".<ref>*"Talak". ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> Scholars disagree whether Islamic holy texts justify traditional Islamic practices such as [[hijab|veiling]] and seclusion ([[purdah]]). Starting in the 20th century, Muslim social reformers argued against these and other practices such as [[Polygamy in Islam|polygamy]], with varying success. At the same time, many Muslim women have attempted to reconcile tradition with modernity by combining an active life with outward modesty. [[Islamist]] groups and regimes like the [[Taliban]] mostly seek to continue traditional law as applied to women.<ref>

{{main|Islamic calendar}}

Islam dates from the Hijra, or migration from Mecca to Medina. This is year 1, AH (Anno Hegira)&mdash;which corresponds to AD 622 or 622 CE, depending on the notation preferred (see [[Common  era]]). It is a [[lunar calendar]], but differs from other such calendars (e.g. the [[Celtic calendar]]) in that it omits [[intercalary month]]s, being synchronized only with [[lunation]]s, but not with the [[solar year]], resulting in years of either 354 or 355 days. This omission was introduced by Muhammad because the right to announce intercalary months had led to political power struggles.{{citation needed}} Therefore, Islamic dates cannot be converted to the usual CE/AD dates simply by adding 622 years. Islamic holy days fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, which means that they occur in different seasons in different years in the [[Gregorian calendar]].


The formal beginning of the Muslim era was chosen to be the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] in 622CE, which was an important turning point in Muhammad's fortunes. The assignment of this year as the year 1 AH (''Anno Hegirae'') in the Islamic calendar was reportedly made by [[Umar|Caliph Umar]]. It is a [[lunar calendar]], with nineteen ordinary years of 354 days and eleven leap years of 355 days in a thirty-year cycle. Islamic dates cannot be converted to CE/AD dates simply by adding 622 years: allowance must also be made for the fact that each Hijri century corresponds to only 97 years in the Christian calendar.<ref>See:
* Adil (2002), p.288

The year 1428AH coincides almost completely with 2007CE.

Islamic [[Holiday|holy days]] fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, which means that they occur in [[Different Seasons|different seasons]] in different years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The most important Islamic festivals are ''[[Eid al-Fitr]]'' (Arabic: عيد الفطر) on the 1<sup>st</sup> of ''[[Shawwal]]'', marking the end of the fasting month ''[[Ramadan]]'', and ''[[Eid al-Adha]]'' (Arabic: عيد الأضحى) on the 10<sup>th</sup> of ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah]]'', coinciding with the pilgrimage to Mecca.<ref>Ghamidi (2001): [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html Customs and Behavioral Laws]</ref>

According to Islamic doctrine, Islam was the primordial religion of mankind, professed by [[Adam]].<ref>Friedmann (2003), pp. 14&ndash;16</ref> At some point, a religious split occurred, and God began sending prophets to bring his revelations to the people.<ref>Friedmann (2003), pp. 18&ndash;19</ref> In this view, [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Nevi'im|Hebrew prophets]], and [[Jesus]] were all [[prophets of Islam]], but their message and the texts of the [[Torah]] and the [[Gospels]] were [[tahrif|corrupted]] by [[Jew]]s and Christians. Similarly, children of non-Muslim families are  born Muslims, but are converted to another faith by their parents.<ref>Friedmann (2003), p. 18</ref> The idea of Islamic supremacy is encapsulated in the formula "Islam is exalted and nothing is exalted above it."<ref>Friedmann (2003), p. 35</ref> Pursuant to this principle, Muslim women may not marry non-Muslim men, defamation of Islam is prohibited, and the testimony of a non-Muslim is inadmissible against a Muslim.<ref>See:
*Friedmann (2003), p. 35;
*Lewis (1984), p. 39</ref>

Islamic law divides non-Muslims into several categories, depending on their relation with the Islamic state. Christians and Jews who live under Islamic rule are known as ''[[dhimmis]]''. Dhimmis must pay tribute (''[[jizya]]'') to the Islamic state, and as such are considered "protected peoples." Historically, dhimmis enjoyed a measure of communal autonomy under their own religious leaders, but were subject to legal, social and religious restrictions as well as humiliating regulations meant to highlight the inferiority of non-Muslim subjects.<ref>See:
*Lewis (1984), pp.9, 27, 36;
*Friedmann (2003), p. 37;</ref> The status was extended to Zoroastrians and sometimes to polytheists (such as [[Hindu]]s), but not to [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]]s.<ref>Lewis (2001), p.273</ref> Those who live in non-Muslim lands (''[[dar al-harb]]'') are known as ''[[harbi]]s'', and upon entering into an alliance with the Muslim state become known as ''ahl al-ahd''. Those who receive a guarantee of safety while residing temporarily in Muslim lands are known as ''ahl al-amān''. Their legal position is similar to that of the dhimmi except that they are not required to pay the jizya. The people of armistice (''ahl al-hudna'') are those who live outside of Muslim territory and agree to refrain from attacking the Muslims.<ref>Friedmann (2003), p. 55</ref><ref>"Aman", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> [[apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]] is prohibited, and is punishable by death.<ref>A woman who apostasizes is to be executed according to some jurists, or imprisoned according to others.</ref><ref>"Murtadd", ''Encyclopedia of Islam''</ref>
