'''اسلام''' ([[عربي ژبه|عربي]]: {{Ar|الإسلام}}; ''{{ArabDIN|}}'' ({{Audio|ar-al_islam.ogg|غوږ شه!}}), "اطاعت" (د [[الله]] د رضا)) يو [[مونوتيزم|مونوتېسټېک]] (يانې د يو واحد څېښتن تعالی يا خدای تعالی وي ورته د غاړې ايښودلو) عقيده ده. پخپله د اسلام وی په مانا د سولې، امن، سلامتي د ايمان او جوړې روغې رامنځته کول دي. دا د [[ابراهيمي دين]]ونو څخه يو دين دی او د نړۍ دوهم لوی [[مذهب]] ګڼل کېږي. د اسلام د دين لارويانو ته '''[[مسلمانان]]''' وايي. مسلمانان پدې عقيده دي چې [[الله]] انسانانو ته د لارښوونې هدايت د ډېرو [[پيغمبر]]انو په ذريعه کړی او [[محمد]] د الله تعالی تر ټولو وروستی پيغمبر ([[د اسلام پيغمبر]]) دی.

==آرپوهه==
اسلام د عربي ژبې د درې تورو، {{ArabDIN|[[سين]]-[[لام]]-[[ميم]]}} ({{ar|'''س'''-'''ل'''-'''م'''}}) نه راوتلی. اسلام د همدغې ريښې يو تجريدي فعل دی چې مانا يې ده "تسليم يا ځان سپارل، څان خدای ته سپارل، اطاعت کول او د سولې" په مانا هم ده.

کله چې د پورتني ويي د ريښو په هکله په نورو ژبو کې څېړنه کوو، نو بيا په عبراني ژبه کې د پورتني وييکي ضمني ماناګانې هم راوځي. په عبراني ژبه کې د ''[[شلوم]]'' ويي، د (شين-لامد-ميم) نه خپلې ريښې اخلي ({{Ivrit|'''ש'''-'''ל'''-'''ם'''}}). په ډېرو [[سېمېټک ژبو]] کې د همدغه لغت ضمني ماناګانې شته، چې مانا يې بشپړکېدل، پوره کېدل، سر ته رسېدنه، ښه اوسېدنه، هوسا اوسېدنه، يو داسې اصطلاح چې په ژباړه کې اکثراً د سولې د وييکي مانا په ځان کې رانغاړي، ورکوي.

هغه نور عربي وييونه چې د {{ar|'''س'''-'''ل'''-'''م'''}} نه راوتلي:

* [[سلام]], چې د "سولې او سلامتۍ" په مانا ده او د ورځيني روغبړ يوه اهمه کلمه ده, [[سلام عليکم|السلام عليکم]] (ته دې سلامت وې/سلامتي دې پر تا وي).
* السلام(سوله)د الله تعالی د ٩٩ مبارکو نومونو نه يو نوم دی چې په [[قران]] کې هم راغلی.
* [[مسلمان]], د اسلام د دين مننونکي ته وايي او مانا يې ده هغه څوک چې ځان الله ته تسليم کوي او يا د الله اطاعت کوي.
* سلامه, د "سلامتي," په مانا ده چې د "خدای پامانۍ" په وخت کې وييل کېږي، د "مع السلامه" مانا ( سلامتۍ سره[لاړ شه]) ده.

==عقيده==
د اسلام بنسټيزه عقيده شهادت دی چې د ګواهۍ مانا لري [[شهادت]] ('''  لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله ''')"نشته بل کوم خدای يا معبود پرته د الله نه او محمد صلی الله عليه وسلم د الله پيغمبر دی." د دې لپاره چې څوک مسلمان شي، نو سړي ته پکار ده چې دغه پورتنی شهادت د يو څو شاهدانو مخکې ووايي او پرې ايمان راوړي. او که چېرته يو څوک غواړي چې اسلام ته راشي نو هغه يا هغې ته پکار ده چې بايد د زړه له صدق نه وغواړي او بيا د دې نه مخکې چې شهادت ووايي نو پکار ده چې د شهادت په اصلي مانا او مفهوم پوه وي.<br>
مسلمانان په دې عقيده دي چې الله (ج) انسانانو ته خپل پيغام د حضرت محمد (ص) او د نورو پيغمبرانو لخوا لکه حضرت آدم عليه السلام، حضرت نوح عليه السلام، حضرت ابراهيم عليه السلام، حضرت موسی عليه السلام او حضرت عيسی عليه السلام له لورې په بېلابېلو وختونو کې رالېږلی. مسلمانان په دې عقيده هم دي چې حضرت محمد صلی الله عليه وآله وسلم د الله وروستنی پيغمبر و او د هغه نه وروسته تر قيامته بل هېڅ کوم پيغمبر نه راځي. نو ددې پخاطر مسلمانان بايد د حضرت محمد صلی الله عليه وآله وسلم په لارښوونې تر قيامته پورې عمل وکړي.
<br>
مسلمانان پدې عقيده دي چې قران د انسانانو د لارښوونې يو داسې کتاب دی چې تر اوسه پکې هېچا ګوتې نه دي وهلي او پدې کتاب کې هېڅ کومه نيمګړتيا نشته، او هېڅ کله به پکې بدلون را نه شي، او دا د خدای له لورې انسانانو ته وروستی نازل شوی کتاب دی. مسلمانان دا هم وايي چې د انجيل او تورات هغه اسماني کتابونه دي چې د بېلابېلو مذهبي فرقو له لورې پکې لاسوهنې شوي په بل ډول سره ليکل شوي او په ناسمه توګه تعبير شوي او د دغو اسماني کتابونو اصلي بڼې اوس نه شته او د وخت په تېرېدو سره خلکو هماغه لومړني لارښوونې چې په اصلي اسماني کتابونو کې وه هېر کړي، او يا يې هم درغلي پکې کړې. نو ددغه ليد پر بنسټ الله تعالی انسانانو ته د لارښوونې لپاره قرآن راولېږه چې په دې کې هماغه د اصلي انجيل او تورات لارښوونو سره سره د هغو وختونو د خلکو چې پېغمبران به يې ځورول او وژل به يې او د الله تعالی له احکامو د سرغړونې سره سره يې د خپل زاتي ګټو لپاره د الله په کلام کې چې بدعتونه راوستلي دا ټول تاريخ ثبت دی. 
<br>
مسلمانان دا هم وايي چې اسلام هماغه دين دی چې د آدم عليه السلام له وختونو نه او د نورو پيغمبرانو په وختونو کې هم وه، او دغو ټولو پيغمبرانو د همدغه مذهب په لار د تلو ټينګار کړی. اسلامي کتابونه او ليکنې د يهوديت او عيسويت د هغو اصلي لارښوونو نه راوتلي چې د حضرت ابراهيم عليه السلام په وختونو کې يې ښوونې شوي نو د همدغه پخاطر دا درېواړه مذهبونه يعنی يهوديت، عيسويت او اسلام چې درېواړه سره ګډې ريښې لري، د ابراهيمي دينونو په نامه سره هم يادېږي.  په قرآن عظيم الشان کې يهوديانو او عيسويانو ته د اهل الکتاب يا هغه خلک چې کتابونه ورباندې نازل شوي، په نامه اشاره شوې ده.    
<br>
اسلام يو [[دين]] دی، دين '''د ژوندون لار''' مانا لري او يا هم په بله وينا د لارښوونې لار. 


===د عقيدې شپږ ارکان===
مسلمانان شپږ بنسټيزه ارکانونو باندې عقيده لري:

# د الله تعالی په پيغمبرانو باندې ايمان راوړل ([[پېغمبران#د اسلام له نظره|''انبيا‌ء'']])  چې ټول پېغمبران (''[[رسول]]'') د الله له خوا رالېږل شوي. ([[د اسلام پېغمبران]] وګورۍ.)
# په اسماني کتابونو عقيده(''[[کتب]]''):
#* په [[ابراهيمي صحيفو]] (ابراهيم عليه السلام باندې نازل شوې صحيفې)
#* په [[تورات]] باندې ايمان راوړل چې همدا کتاب پر [[موسی (ع)]] باندې نازل شوی.

# په قيامت او وروسته د مرګ نه د بيا ژوندي کېدلو عقيده (''[[قيامة]]'')  (په [[جنت]] او دوزخ عقيده). (يادونه: کله ناکله دغه وروستۍ موضوع باندې ځانګړی بحث کېږی, او په همدې توګه د عقيدې ارکان اوو ته رسېږي.)
# په قسمت عقيده([[تقدير]]).


د اسلام بنسټيزه عقيده په [[پښتو]] ژبه :
:: "زه شهادت ورکوم چې پرته د الله تعالی د ذات نه بل کوم ذات نه شته؛ او زه شهادت ورکوم چې محمد (صلی الله عليه وآله وسلم) د هغه پيغمبر دی."
:: "زه په الله تعالی ايمان راوړم؛ او د هغه په ملايکو؛ او د هغه په کتابونو؛ او د هغه په پيغمبرانو؛ او د محشر په ورځ؛ او په تقدير؛ او ټول شيان د الله تعالی له خوا نه دي، او پس د مرګ نه ژوندون حق دی."

===د اسلام پينځه بنسټونه===
''Main articles: [[Five Pillars of Islam]], [[Branches of Religion]], [[Roots of Religion]]''

[[Image:Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|The Pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]) to [[Kaaba]], [[Masjid al Haram]], Mecca, is one of the five pillars of Islam or one of the roots of religion (for the Shi'a).]]
د مسلمانانو دوه لويې فرقې سني او شعيه مسلمانان جوړوي. په اسلامي نړئ کې د شعيه ګانو په پرتله ډېرئ مسلمانان سنيان دي، خو په څينو هېوادونو کې لکه د منڅنئ آسيا هېوادونه ايران او عراق بيا شعيه مسلمانان ډېرکئ مذهبي ډله جوړوي. خو په نورو هېوادونو کط لکه سعودي عربستان، اندونيزيا او پاکستان کې سني مسلمان د هغه هېوادونو په مذهبي ټولنو کې ډېرکۍ برخه جوړوي.

Sunni Islam's fundamental tenets are referred to as the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]<sup>[[#Notes|2]]</sup>, while Shia Islam  has a slightly different terminology, encompassing five core beliefs, the [[Roots of Religion]] and ten core practices, the [[Branches of Religion]]. All Muslims agree on the following five basic obligations of believers, which Sunnis term the Five Pillars of Islam, and which Shia would consider to be elements of the Roots of Religion and the Branches of Religion. 

*[[شهادت]]: Testifying that there is none worthy of worship  except God ([[Tawheed]]) and that [[Muhammad]] is his servant and messenger ([[نبوت]]).
*[[لمونځ]]: هره ورځ پينځه وخته لمونځ کول.
*[[روژه]]: د روژې په مياشت کې د لمرخاته نه تر لمرپرېواته روژه نيول.
*[[زکات]]: زکات ورکول.
*[[حج]]: The Pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] during the month of ''Dhul Hijjah'', which is compulsory once in a lifetime for one who has the ability to do it.

شعيه او سنيان دواړه په لاندنيو ګروهو باندې باور لري، خو دغه دوه فرقې همدا عقايد په بېلابېلو ډلبنديو وېشي او هره ډله ورته ځانګړی تعبير لري:
*[[عدل]]: د الله عدل.
*[[قيامت]]: د خېر او شر د مالومولو ورځ.
*[[امر بل معروف]]: د ښو امر.
*[[نهي عن المنکر]]: د بدو نه ډډه.
*[[جهاد|الجهاد في سبيل الله]]: د الله تعالی د رضا لپاره هڅه کوشش او زيار.

Distinctive Shi'a beliefs, not held by the Sunni, include:
*[[امامت]]: Leadership. The belief in the divinely appointed and guided [[imam]]ate of [[Ali]] and some of his descendants.
*[[Tawalla]]: To love the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and their followers.
*[[Tabarra]]: To disassociate from the enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt.
*[[Khums]]: Paying the tax on profit.

Many Muslims, however, do not fall into any of the denominations listed above. These Muslims believe that the following extract from the Qu'ran bans the formation of sects within Islam, and therefore classify themselves as simply 'Muslims'.

"[6:159] Those who divide themselves into sects do not belong with you. Their judgment rests with GOD, then He will inform
them of everything they had done."

===خدای===
:''Main articles: [[الله]] / [[خدای]]

The fundamental concept in Islam is the oneness of [[God]] (''[[tawhid]]''). This monotheism is absolute, not relative or  pluralistic in any sense of the word. God is described in [[Sura]] [[al-Ikhlas]], (chapter 112) as follows:

:''Say "He is God, the one and only. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute the Self-Sufficient master. He begetteth not, nor is he  begotten. And there is none like unto Him."

In Arabic, God is called ''Allāh''. The word is etymologically connected to ''ʾilāh'' "[[deity]]",  ''Allāh'' is also the word  used by Christian and Jewish Arabs, translating ''ho theos'' of the [[New Testament]] and [[Septuagint]]; it predates Muhammad and in its origin does not specify a "God" different from the one worshipped by Judaism and Christianity, the other [[Abrahamic]] religions.

The name "Allah" shows no plural or gender, unlike the word "God" that may take plural sense "Gods" and feminine form "Goddesses". In Islam "Allah" Almighty as the Qur’an says:

:''"(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things)" (42:11).

The implicit usage of the [[definite article]] in ''Allah'' linguistically indicates the divine unity. Muslims believe that the God they worship is the same as the Judeo-Christian God, i.e. the God of Abraham. However, Muslims reject the Christian theology concerning the trinity of God (the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] which regards Jesus as the eternal [[Son of God]]), seeing it as akin to [[polytheism]]. Quoting from the Qur'an,
[[sura]] [[An-Nisa]](4) :171:

:''"O People of the Scripture! Do not transgress the limits of your religion, and do not say about God except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was only a messenger of God, and His word that He had sent to Mary, and a revelation from Him. Therefore, you shall believe in GOD and His messengers. You shall not say, "Trinity". You shall refrain from this for your own good. God is only one God. Be He glorified; He is much too glorious to have a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. God suffices as Lord and Master."''

No Muslim visual images or depictions of God exist because such artistic depictions may lead to [[idolatry]] and are thus disdained. Such [[aniconism]] can also be found in Judeo-Christian theology. Moreover, most Muslims believe that God is [[Spiritual being|incorporeal]], making any two- or three- dimensional depictions impossible. Instead, Muslims describe God by the many [[99 Names of God|divine attributes]] mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]. All but one Sura (chapter) of the Qur'an begins with the phrase "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful". These are regarded as the most important divine attributes, at least in the sense that Muslims repeat them most frequently during their prayers ([[salat]]) and throughout their daily lives.

===قران عظيم الشان===
[[Image:FirstSurahKoran.jpg|thumb|300px| <font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">د قرآن لومړنۍ سوره [[الفاتحه]] د قران عظيم شان د لاسي نسخې يو انځور.]]
{{main|قرآن}}

The Qur'an is the sacred book of Islam. It has also been called, in English, "the Koran" and (archaically) "the Alcoran". Qur'an is the currently preferred English transliteration of the Arabic original (&#1602;&#1585;&#1570;&#1606;); it means &#8220;recitation&#8221;. Although the Qur'an is referred to as a "book", when a Muslim refers to the Qur'an, they are referring to the actual text, the words, rather than the printed work itself.

Muslims believe that the Qur'an was revealed to the prophet [[Muhammad]] by God through the [[Gabriel (archangel)|Angel Gabriel]] on numerous occasions between the years [[610]] and up till his death in [[632]]. In addition to memorizing his revelations, his followers are said to have written them down on parchments, stones, and leaves.

Muslims hold that the Qur'an available today is the same as that revealed to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and by him to his followers, who memorized and wrote down his words. Scholars generally accept that the version of the Qur'an used today was first compiled in writing by the third [[Caliph]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]], sometime between [[650]] and [[656]]. He sent copies of his version to the various provinces of the new Muslim empire, and directed that all variant copies be destroyed. However, some skeptics doubt the recorded oral traditions ([[hadith]]) on which this account is based, and will concede only that the Qur'an must have been compiled before [[750]].

There are numerous traditions, and many conflicting academic theories, as to the provenance of the Qur'anic verses that were eventually assembled into a single volume. (This is covered in greater detail in [[Qur'an]]). Most Muslims accept the account recorded in several hadith, which state that [[Abu Bakr]], The First Caliph, ordered his personal secretary [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] to collect and record all the authentic verses of the Qur'an, as preserved in written form or oral tradition. Zayd's written collection, privately treasured by Prophet Muhammad's wife [[Hafsa bint Umar]], was, according to Muslim sources, later used by Uthman and is thus the basis of today's Qur'an.

Uthman's version, organized the suras roughly in order of length (excepting the brief opening surah [[Al-Fatiha]]), with the longest suras at the start of the Qur'an and the shortest ones at the end. More conservative views state that the order of most suras was divinely set. Later scholars have struggled to put the suras in chronological order, and among Muslim commentators, at least, there is a rough consensus as to which suras were revealed in [[Makkan sura|Mecca]] and which at [[Medinan sura|Medina]], with distinctive characteristics observed within these two subgroups. Some suras (e.g. surat [[Iqra]]) are thought to have been revealed in parts at separate times.

To understand the notion of "variants" within the received Qur'anic text, one must understand that Arabic had not yet fully developed as a written language. The Qur'an was first recorded in written form (date uncertain) in the [[Hijazi]], [[Mashq]], [[Ma'il]], and [[Kufic]] scripts; these scripts write consonants only and do not supply vowels. (Imagine an English text that wrote the word 'bed' as "BD," and required the reader to infer, from context, that the reference was to "bed" - and not to 'bad" or "bide.") Because there were differing oral traditions of recitation as non-native Arabic speakers converted to Islam, there was some disagreement as to the exact reading of many (vowel-free) verses. Eventually, scripts were  developed that used diacritical markings (known as ''points'') to indicate the vowels. For hundreds of years after Uthman's recension, Muslim scholars argued as to the correct pointing and reading of Uthman's (unpointed) official text.{{citation needed}} Eventually, most commentators accepted seven variant readings ([[qira'at]]) of the Qur'an as canonical, while agreeing that the differences among the seven are minor and do not affect the meaning of the text.

The form of the Qur'an most used today is the [[Al-Azhar]] text of 1923, prepared by a committee at the prestigious [[Cairo]] university of Al-Azhar.

The Qur'an early became a focus of Muslim devotion and eventually a subject of theological controversy among skeptics. In the [[8th century]], the [[Mu'tazili]]s claimed that the Qur'an was created in time and was not eternal. Their opponents, of various schools, claimed that the Qur'an was eternal and perfect, existing in heaven before it was revealed to Muhammad. The [[Ashari]] theology (which ultimately became predominant) held that the Qur'an was uncreated.

Most Muslims regard paper copies of the Qur'an with extreme veneration, wrapping them in a clean cloth, keeping them on a high shelf, and washing as for prayers before reading the Qur'an. Old Qur'ans are not destroyed as wastepaper, but burned.

Most Muslims memorize for personal contact at least some portion of the Qur'an in the  original language. Those who have memorized the entire Qur'an are known as [[hafiz]]. This is not a rare achievement; it is believed that there are millions of [[huffaz]] (plural) alive today.

From the beginning of the faith, most Muslims believed that the Qur'an was perfect only as revealed in Arabic. Translations were the result of human effort and human fallibility, as well as lacking the inspired poetry believers find in the Qur'an. Translations are therefore only commentaries on the Qur'an, or "translations of its meaning", not the Qur'an itself. Many modern, printed versions of the Qur'an feature the Arabic text on one page, and a vernacular translation on the facing page.

===Islamic eschatology===
{{main|Islamic eschatology}}

Islamic [[eschatology]] is concerned with the ''[[Qiyamah]]'' ([[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]) and the final  judgment of humanity. Like [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], Islam teaches the bodily [[resurrection]] of the dead, the fulfilment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul. In Islamic belief, the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of ''Jannah'' ([[Paradise]]), while the unrighteous are punished in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (a fiery [[Hell]], from the Hebrew ''ge-hinnom'' or "valley of Hinnom"; usually rendered in English as [[Gehenna]]). A significant portion of the Qur'an deals with these beliefs, with many ''[[hadith]]'' elaborating on the themes and details.

==تنظيمونه==
===Religious authority===
There is no official authority who decides whether a person is accepted into, or dismissed from, the community of believers, known as the ''[[Ummah]]'' ("family" or "nation"). Islam is open to all, regardless of race, age, gender, or previous beliefs. It is enough to believe in the central beliefs of Islam. This is formally done by reciting the ''[[shahada]]'', which should be made sincerely from the heart, the statement of belief of Islam, without which a person cannot be classed a Muslim. It is enough to believe and say that one is a Muslim, and behave in a manner befitting a Muslim to be accepted into the community of Islam.

===اسلامي قانون===
{{main|Sharia}}
The Sharia is Islamic law, as elaborated by Islamic scholarship. The [[Qur'an]] is the foremost source of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. The second is the [[sunnah]] of Muhammad and the early Muslim community. The sunnah is not itself a text like the Qur'an, but is extracted by analysis of the [[hadith]] (Arabic for "report"), or recorded oral traditions, which contain narrations of the Muhammad's sayings, deeds, and actions. [[Ijma]] (consensus of the community of Muslims) and [[qiyas]] (analogical reasoning) are the third and fourth sources of Sharia.

Islamic law covers all aspects of life, from the broad topics of governance and foreign relations all the way down to issues of daily living. Islamic laws which were covered expressly in the Qur'an were referred to as ''hudud'' laws. This covered the prohibition of murder, extra-marital sex, drinking of alcohol and gambling. The Qur'an also details laws of inheritance, marriage, restitution for injuries and murder, as well as rules for fasting, charity, and prayer. However, the prescriptions and prohibitions may be broad, so how they are applied in practice varies. Islamic scholars, ''the ulema'', have elaborated systems of law on the basis of these broad rules, supplemented by the hadith reports of how Muhammad and his companions interpreted them. See [[Sin]] for further discussion about the concept of sin and its atonement according to the Islamic law.

In current times, not all Muslims understand the Qur'an in its original Arabic. Thus, when Muslims are divided in how to handle situations, they seek the assistance of a [[mufti]] (Islamic judge) who can advise them based on Islamic [[Sharia]] and hadith.

====Apostasy and Blasphemy====
{{main|Apostasy in Islam}}

Local Islamic communities may exclude those they regard as [[apostasy|apostates]] and [[blasphemy|blasphemers]]. In Muslim-majority states, apostasy and blasphemy are considered crimes against the state and punished, sometimes with death.

===اسلامي کليز===
{{main|Islamic calendar}}

Islam dates from the Hijra, or migration from Mecca to Medina. This is year 1, AH (Anno Hegira)&mdash;which corresponds to AD 622 or 622 CE, depending on the notation preferred (see [[Common  era]]). It is a [[lunar calendar]], but differs from other such calendars (e.g. the [[Celtic calendar]]) in that it omits [[intercalary month]]s, being synchronized only with [[lunation]]s, but not with the [[solar year]], resulting in years of either 354 or 355 days. This omission was introduced by Muhammad because the right to announce intercalary months had led to political power struggles.{{citation needed}} Therefore, Islamic dates cannot be converted to the usual CE/AD dates simply by adding 622 years. Islamic holy days fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, which means that they occur in different seasons in different years in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

==Schools (denominations)==
{{main_article|[[Divisions of Islam]]}}
There are a number of Islamic religious denominations, each of which has significant theological and legal differences from each other but possess identical essential belief. The major schools of thought are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]], with [[Sufi]]sm considered as a mystical inflection of Islam.

===اهل سنت===
The [[Sunni]] are  the largest group in Islam. In [[Arabic]], ''as-Sunnah'' literally means '''principle''' or '''path'''.
Sunnis and shi'ites believe that Muhammad was a perfect human being, and that they must imitate the words and acts of Muhammad as accurately as possible. In fact, the Qur'an states that the character of the Prophet Muhammad was a good example to follow. Because of this reason, the [[Hadith]] in which those words and acts are described are the main pillar of Sunni doctrine. It should be also noted that Sunnis do not believe that Muhammad was sinless(See [[Sin]]). 

Sunnis recognize four legal traditions ([[madhhab]]s): [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanafi]], and [[Hanbali]]. All four  accept the validity of the others and Muslims choose any one that he/she finds agreeable to his/her ideas. There are also several orthodox theological or philosophical traditions ([[kalam]]).

===اهل تشيعه===
[[Image:Dome_of_the_rock_distance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A view of the [[Dome of the Rock]] on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]], a holy site in Islam]]
[[Shi'a]] Muslims, the second-largest sect, differ from the Sunni in rejecting the authority of the first three caliphs. They honor different traditions ([[hadith]]) and have their own legal traditions. Shi'a scholars have a larger authority than Sunni scholars and have greater room for interpretation. The [[Imams]] play a central role in Shi'a doctrine. 

The arabic word Shi'a, litarally translates into the word 'group' or 'sect'. Originally known as Shi'at Ali (the sect of Ali), the group formed shortly after the death of Ali, in [[Iraq]]. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the cousin of prophet [[Muhammad]], and after marriage to Fatima, he also became Muhammad's son-in-law.

The Shi'a consist of one major school of thought known as the [[Ithna 'ashariyah]] or the "[[Twelvers]]", and a few minor schools of thought, as the "Seveners" or the "Fivers" referring to the number of infallible leaders they recognize after the death of prophet [[Muhammad]]. The term Shi'a, when used without qualification, is usually taken to be synonymous with the Ithna Ashariyya or Twelvers. Most Shi'a live in [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] (the country where Ali passed away), [[Bahrain]], [[Lebanon]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. A minority group (about 4 million) of Shi'a is known as [[Ismaili]]. The Shia Ismaili sect is subdivided into [[Nizari]] Ismaili and [[Mustaali]] Bohra subsects. The Nizari Ismaili or are led by the [[Aga Khan]] and are found mainly in [[Pakistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Bangladesh]], India, Canada and United States. The [[Mustaali]] Bohra sect is further subdivded into Dawoodi and Sulaimanis subsects. The [[Dawoodi Bohra]]s are concentrated in Pakistan and India. The [[Sulaimani Bohra]]s are concentrated in Yemen and Najran province of Saudi Arabia.

{{see also|Historic background of the Sunni-Shi'a split}}

===صوفيت===
[[Sufism]] is a spiritual practice followed by both Sunni and Shi'a. Sufis generally feel that following Islamic law or jurisprudence (or ''fiqh'') is only the first step on the path to perfect submission; they focus on the internal or more spiritual aspects of Islam, such as perfecting one's faith and fighting one's own ego (''nafs''). Most Sufi orders, or [[tariqa]], can be classified as either Sunni or Shi'a. However, there are some that are not easily categorized as either Sunni or Shi'a, such as the [[Bektashi]]. Sufis are found throughout the Islamic world, from [[Senegal]] to [[Indonesia]].

===نورې طريقې===
[[Wahhabi]]s, as they are known by non-Wahhabis, are a smaller, more recent Sunni group. They prefer to be called [[Salafi]]s. Wahhabism is a movement founded by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab]] in the [[18th century]] in what is present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. They classify themselves as Sunni and some claim to follow the [[Hanbali]] legal tradition. The major trend, however, is the  abolition of these "schools of thoughts" (legal traditions), and the following of a more literalist interpretation. Some even regard other Sunni as heretics. The [[Hanbali]] legal tradition is the recognized official school of Islamic law in Saudi Arabia and they have had a great deal of influence on the Islamic world because of Saudi control of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the Islamic holy places, and because of Saudi funding for mosques and schools in other countries. The majority of Saudi Islamic scholars are considered as [[Wahhabi]]s by other parts of the Islamic world. 

Sunni and Shi'a have often clashed. Some Sunni believe that Shi'a  are heretics while other Sunni recognize Shi'a as fellow Muslims. According to Shaikh Mahmood Shaltoot, head of the [[al-Azhar University]] in the middle part of the 20th century, "the Ja'fari school of thought, which is also known as "al-Shi'a al- Imamiyyah al-Ithna Ashariyyah" (i.e. The Twelver Imami Shi'ites) is a school of thought that is religiously correct to follow in worship as are other Sunni schools of thought". Al-Azhar later distanced itself from this position.

Another sect which dates back to the early days of Islam is that of the [[Kharijites]]. The only surviving branch of the Kharijites are the [[Ibadi|Ibadhi Muslim]]s. Ibadhism is distinguished from Shiism by its belief that the Imam (Leader) should be chosen solely on the basis of his faith, not on the basis of descent, and from Sunnism in its rejection of [[Uthman]] and [[Ali]] and strong emphasis on the need to depose unjust rulers.  Ibadhi Islam is noted for its strictness, but, unlike the Kharijites proper, Ibadhis do not regard major sins as automatically making a Muslim an unbeliever. Most Ibadhi Muslims live in [[Oman]].

Another trend in modern Islam is that which is sometimes called progressive. Followers may be called [[Ijtihadists]]. They may be either Sunni or Shi'ite, and generally favor the development of  personal interpretations of Qur'an and Hadith. ''See'': [[Liberal Islam]]

One very small group, based primarily in the United States, follows the teachings of [[Rashad Khalifa]] and calls itself the "Submitters". They reject [[hadith]] and [[fiqh]], and say that they follow the Qur'an alone. Most Muslims of both the [[Sunni]] and the [[Shia]] sects consider this group to be heretical.

==هغه مذهبونه چې د اسلام پر بنسټ جوړ شوي==
دا لانديني مذهبونو لارويان ځانونه مسلمانان بولي، خو د ډېرو مسلمانانو او مسلمانو چارواکو لخوا دوی مسلمانان نه بلل کېږي:
* [[د اسلام ملت]] (په امريکا کې بنسټ شوې مذهبي ډله)
* [[ذکري]]ان
* د [[احمديت]] تحريک (دې ډلې ته [[قاديانيت]] هم وايي)
* د [[الاحبش]] ډله (چې د حبشيانو په نامه هم يادېږي/ AICP)

د لاندې مذهبونو لارويان ځانونه مسلمانان بولي خو د دوی د اسلاميت په منلو کې د ډېرو مسلمانانو اختلافونه شته چې ځينې يې دوی مسلمانان او ځينې يې مسلمانان نه ګڼي:
* [[دروز]]
* [[علوي]]ان (النُصيرية)

The following religions are said by some to have evolved or borrowed from Islam, in almost all cases influenced by traditional beliefs in the regions where they emerged, but consider themselves independent religions with distinct laws and institutions:
* [[يزيدي]]
* [[بابيس|بابيزم]] (چې اوس د [[بياني]]انو په نامه يادېږي)
* [[بهايي]]

The claim of the adherents of the Bahá'í Faith that it represents an independent religion was upheld by the Muslim ecclesiastical courts in Egypt during the 1920s. As of January [[1926]], their final ruling on the matter of the origins of the Bahá'í Faith and its relationship to Islam was that the Bahá'í Faith was neither a sect of Islam, nor a religion based on Islam, but a clearly defined, independently founded faith. This was seen as a considerate act on the part of the ecclesiastical court and in favor of followers of Bahá'í Faith since the majority of Muslims regard a ''religion based on Islam'' as a heresy.

Some see [[Sikhism]] as a [[syncretism|syncretic]] mix of Islam and [[Hinduism]], although it is often considered a [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith rather than an Islamic or [[Abrahamic]] one. It arose in the context of the interaction between [[Hindu]] and Muslim communities in [[North India]].

The following religions might have been said to have evolved from Islam, but are not considered part of Islam, and no longer exist:
* The religion of the medieval [[Berghouata]]
* The religion of [[Ha-Mim]]

==اسلام او نور دينونه==
{{main|Islam and other religions}}

The Qur'an contains injunctions to respect other religions. It also asks the followers to fight and subdue unbelievers in times of war and "evict them whence they evicted you" (Al-Qur'an 2:191). Some Muslims have respected Jews and Christians as fellow "peoples of the book" (monotheists following [[Abrahamic religions]]), while others have reviled them as having abandoned monotheism and corrupted their scriptures. At different times and places, Islamic communities have been both intolerant and tolerant.

The classical Islamic solution was a limited tolerance &mdash; Jews and Christians were to be allowed to privately practice their faith and follow their own family law. They were called [[Dhimmis]], and they had fewer though similar legal rights and obligations than Muslims.

The classic Islamic state was often more tolerant than many other states of the time, which insisted on complete conformity to a state religion. The record of contemporary Muslim-majority states is mixed. Some are generally regarded as tolerant, while others have been accused of intolerance and human rights violations. See the main article, [[Islam and other religions]], for further discussion.

==اسلامي پېښليک (تاريخ)==
{{main|History of Islam}}

Modern Islamic history begins in [[Arabia]] in the [[7th century]] with the emergence of the prophet [[Muhammad]]. Within a century of his death, an Islamic state stretched from the [[Atlantic ocean]] in the west to [[central Asia]] in the east, which, however, was soon torn by civil wars ([[fitna]]s). After this, there would always be rival dynasties claiming the [[caliphate]], or leadership of the Muslim world, and many Islamic states or empires offering only token obedience to an increasingly powerless [[caliph]].

Nonetheless, the later empires of the [[Abbasid]] caliphs and the [[Seljuk Turks]] were among the largest and most powerful in the world. After the disastrous defeat of the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in [[1071]], Christian Europe launched a series of [[Crusades]] and for a time captured Jerusalem. [[Saladin]], however, restored unity and defeated the [[Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s.

From the 14th to the 17th centuries, one of the most important Muslim territories was the [[Mali Empire]], whose capital was [[Timbuktu]].

In the 18th century, there were three great Muslim empires: the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] in Turkey, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean; the [[Safavid]] in Iran; and the [[Mogul]] in India. By the [[19th century]], these realms had fallen under the sway of European political and economic power. Following [[WWI]], the remnants of the Ottoman empire were parceled out as European [[protectorate]]s or [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. Islam and Islamic political power have revived in the [[20th century]]. However, the relationship between the West and the Islamic world remains uneasy.

===نوی اسلام===
[[Image:Islam by country.png|thumb|right|300px|Countries with Muslim populations over 10% of total (source - [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]], 2004). The darker green represents a [[Sunni]] majority and the light green represents a [[Shia]] majority.]]

Although the most prominent movement in Islam in recent times has been [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Islamism]], there are a number of [[liberal movements within Islam]], which seek alternative ways to align the Islamic faith with contemporary questions.

Early [[Sharia]] had a much more flexible character than is currently associated with [[Islamic jurisprudence]], and many modern Muslim scholars believe that it should be renewed, and the classical jurists should lose their special status. This would require formulating a new [[fiqh]] suitable for the modern world, e.g. as proposed by advocates of the [[Islamization of knowledge]], and would deal with the modern context. One vehicle proposed for such a change has been the revival of the principle of [[ijtihad]], or independent reasoning by a qualified Islamic scholar, which has lain dormant for centuries.

This movement does not aim to challenge the fundamentals of Islam; rather, it seeks to clear away misinterpretations and to free the way for the renewal of the previous status of the Islamic world as a centre of modern thought and freedom. (See [[Modern Islamic philosophy]] for more on this subject.)

Many Muslims counter the claim that only "liberalization" of the Islamic Sharia law can lead to distinguishing between [[tradition]] and true Islam by saying that meaningful "fundamentalism", by definition, will eject non-Islamic cultural inventions &mdash; for instance, acknowledging and implementing Muhammad's insistence that women have God-given rights that no human being may legally infringe upon. Proponents of modern Islamic philosophy sometimes respond to this by arguing that, as a practical matter, "fundamentalism" in popular discourse about Islam may actually refer, not to core precepts of the faith, but to various systems of cultural traditionalism.

===The demographics of Islam today===
{{main articles|[[Islam by country]] and [[Demographics of Islam]]}}
Based on the percentages published in the [[2005]] [[CIA World Factbook]] ([http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/xx.html "World"]), Islam is the second-largest religion in the world. According to the [http://www.wnrf.org/news/trends.html World Network of Religious Futurists], the [http://www.religioustolerance.org/growth_isl_chr.htm U.S. Center for World Mission], and the [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], Islam is growing faster numerically than any of the other [[major world religions]]. This is attributed to high rates of [[Religious conversion#Conversion to Islam| conversion]] to Islam.

Commonly cited estimates of the Muslim population today range  between 1,4 billion and 1.9 billion people (http://www.islamicweb.com/begin/results.htm]); while the Muslim delegation at the United Nations quoted 1.5 billion as the global Muslim population in September 2005.

Only 18% of [[Muslim|Muslims]] live in the [[Arab]] world; 20% are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, about 30% in the [[South Asia]]n region of [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and the world's largest single Muslim community (within the bounds of one nation) is in [[Indonesia]]. There are also significant Muslim populations in [[China]], [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Russia]].

[[Islam in Austria|Austria]] was the first European country to recognize Islam as an official religion, while [[France]] has the highest Muslim population of any nation in Western Europe, with up to 6 million Muslims (10% of the population [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html#People]). [[Albania]] is said to have the highest proportion of Muslims as part of its population in Europe (70%), although this figure is only an estimate (see [[Islam in Albania]]). The number of Muslims in [[North America]] is variously estimated as anywhere from 4,8  to 10 million.
