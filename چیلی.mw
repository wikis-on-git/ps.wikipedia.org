}}The '''Republic of Chile''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''{{Audio|RepChile.ogg|República de Chile}}'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[re'puβlika ðe 'tʄile]}}) is a country in [[South America]] occupying a long coastal strip between the [[Andes]] mountains and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It borders [[ارجنټاين]] to the east, [[Bolivia]] to the northeast and [[Peru]] to the north.
==Origin of the name==

There are various theories about the origin of the word ''Chile.'' According to one theory the [[Inca]]s of Peru, who had failed to conquer the [[Araucanian]]s, called the valley of the [[Aconcagua]] "Chili" by corruption of the name of a [[tribal chief]] ("cacique") called ''Tili'', who ruled the area at the time of the Incan conquest. Another theory points to the similarity of the valley of the Aconcagua with that of the [[Casma Valley]] in Peru, where there was a town and valley named ''Chili.'' Other theories say Chile may derive its name from the indigenous Mapuche word ''chilli,'' which may mean "where the land ends" or "the deepest point of the Earth," or from the Aymara ''tchili'' meaning "snow"; another meaning attributed to ''chilli'' is the onomatopoeic ''cheele-cheele''—the Mapuche imitation of a bird call. The Spanish conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas and the few survivors of [[Diego de Almagro]]'s first Spanish expedition south from Peru in 1535-1536 called themselves the "men of Chilli."

== History ==
{{main|History of Chile}}

About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in fertile valleys and along the coast of what is now Chile. The [[Inca]]s briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the area's remoteness and the fierce opposition of the native population prevented extensive settlement.

[[Image:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|Pedro de Valdivia]]

In [[1520]], while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, the Portuguese [[Ferdinand Magellan]], discovered the southern passage now named after him, the [[Straits of Magellan]].  The next Europeans to reach Chile were [[Diego de Almagro]] and his band of Spanish [[conquistador]]s, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking [[gold]] but were turned back by the local population. The Spanish encountered hundreds of thousands of Indians from various cultures in the area that modern Chile now occupies. These cultures supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn [[agriculture]] and [[hunting]]. The first permanent European settlement, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], was founded in [[1541]] by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and [[silver]] they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].

Conquest of the land that is today called Chile took place only gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the local population. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in [[1553]] resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in [[1598]] and in [[1655]].  Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] in [[1683]] defused tensions on the frontier between the colony and the Mapuche land to the south, and permitted increased trade between colonists and Mapuches.

The drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish throne]] by [[Napoleon]]'s brother Joseph, in [[1808]]. A national junta in the name of Ferdinand—heir to the deposed king—was formed on [[September 18]], [[1810]]. The [[junta]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish [[monarchy]]. A movement for total independence soon won a wide following.  Spanish attempts to reimpose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle.[[Image:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|Bernardo O'Higgins]]

The movement toward independence began in 1810 under the leadership of Juan Martínez de Rozas and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]]. The first phase (1810–14) ended in defeat at Rancagua, largely because of the rivalry of O'Higgins with José Miguel Carrera and his brothers. In 1817, José de San Martín, with incredible hardship, brought an army over the Andes from Argentina to Chile. The following year he won the decisive battle of Maipú over the Spaniards.

Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by ruthlessly suppressing the [[Mapuche]] Indians, finally completing the conquest begun more than three centuries earlier. In [[1881]], the government signed a treaty with Argentina confirming Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia ([[1879]]–[[1883|83]]), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable nitrate deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.  The [[Chilean Civil War]] in [[1891]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Hence the Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the [[1920s]], the emerging middle and [[working class]]es were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. Alessandri Palma's reformist tendencies were partly tempered later by an admiration for some elements of [[Mussolini]]'s Italian Corporate State. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in [[1924]] set off a period of great political instability that lasted until [[1932]]. The longest lasting of the ten governments between those years was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez]], who briefly held power in [[1925]] and then again between [[1927]] and [[1931]] in what was a de facto dictatorship, although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of [[Latin America]], and certainly not comparable to the violent and repressive regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]] decades later. By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology.  When constitutional rule was restored in [[1932]], a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years.  During the period of [[Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez, now reincarnated as a sort of Chilean [[Juan Perón|Perón]], to office for another 6 years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[1964]] presidential election of [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile| Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an absolute majority initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty," the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.

In [[1970]], Senator [[Salvador Allende|Salvador Allende Gossens]], a Marxist physician and member of Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], who headed the "[[Popular Unity]]" (UP or "Unidad Popular") coalition of the Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement ([[MAPU]]), and the Independent Popular Action, won a [[plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest. Despite pressure from the government of the United States, the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]], keeping with tradition, conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president [[Jorge Alessandri]] and chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the oligarchs.

Allende's program included advancement of workers' interests; a thoroughgoing implementation of agrarian reform; the reorganization of the national economy into socialized, mixed, and private sectors; a foreign policy of "international solidarity" and national independence; and a new institutional order (the "people's state" or "poder popular"), including the institution of a unicameral congress. The Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of foreign (U.S.) ownership of Chile's major [[copper]] mines.

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1967 peaked in 1970, exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits by those opposed to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and [[unemployment]] rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the [[banking]] sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the [[copper]], [[coal]], [[iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[steel]] industries were [[expropriation|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention.  Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.

Other reforms undertaken during the early Allende period included redistribution of millions of hectares of land to landless agricultural workers as part of the agrarian reform program, giving the armed forces an overdue pay increase, and providing free [[milk]] to children. The Indian Peoples Development Corporation and the Mapuche Vocational Institute were founded to address the needs of Chile's indigenous population.

The nationalization of U.S. and other foreign-owned companies led to increased tensions with the [[United States]]. The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration brought international financial pressure to bear in order to restrict economic credit to Chile. Simultaneously, the [[CIA]] funded opposition media, politicians, and organizations, helping to accelerate a campaign of domestic destabilization. By [[1972]], the economic progress of Allende's first year had been reversed and the economy was in crisis. Political polarization increased, and large mobilizations of both pro- and anti-government groups became frequent, often leading to clashes.

By early [[1973]], [[inflation]] was out of control. The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous [[strike action|strikes]] by physicians, teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business class. A [[Chilean coup of 1973|military coup]] overthrew Allende on [[September 11]] [[1973]]. As the armed forces bombarded the [[Palacio de La Moneda|presidential palace]] (Palacio de La Moneda), Allende reportedly committed suicide. A military government, led by General [[Augusto Pinochet Ugarte]], took over control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by serious [[human rights violation]]s. On October 1973, at least 70 persons were murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]]. At least a thousand people were executed during the first six months of Pinochet in office, and at least two thousand more were killed during the next sixteen years, as reported by the [[Valech Report]]. Some 30,000 were forced to flee the country. A new [[Constitution]] was approved by a highly irregular and undemocratic [[plebiscite]] characterized by the absence of registration lists, on [[September 11]] [[1980]], and General Pinochet became President of the Republic for an 8-year term. In the late 1980s, the regime gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and limited political activity. The right-wing military government pursued decidedly ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies. During its nearly 17 years in power, Chile moved away from economic statism toward a largely [[free market economy]] that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not returned to foreign ownership.  In a plebiscite on [[October 5]], [[1988]], General Pinochet was denied a second 8-year term as president.  Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on [[December 14]], [[1989]]. Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 16 political parties called the [[Concertation of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]], received an absolute majority of votes. President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.

In December [[1993]], Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes. President Frei's administration was inaugurated in March 1994.

A presidential election was held on [[December 12]], [[1999]], but none of the six candidates obtained a majority, which led to an unprecedented runoff election on [[January 16]], [[2000]] between [[Ricardo Lagos]] and [[Joaquín Lavín]] of the rightist [[Alliance for Chile]]. [[Ricardo Lagos|Ricardo Lagos Escobar]] of the Socialist Party led the Concertación coalition to a narrow victory, with 51.31% of the votes.  He was sworn in [[March 11]], [[2000]], for a 6-year term.

Chile's current president-elect is the former health and later defense minister [[Michelle Bachelet]], daughter of Alberto Bachelet, an air force general who was captured and tortured in the military coup of 1973 and died shortly after. Ms. Bachelet continues the center-left [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] government in their fourth term. She is the first and so far the only woman president in the country's history.  She won the [[2006]] runoff election against center-right candidate [[Sebastián Piñera]] after none of the four main candidates obtained the necessary 50% of the votes in the first round of voting.  Bachelet will be sworn in for a four-year term, instead of a six-year term, following reforms to the Constitution in 2005.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Chile}}

Chile's [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]] was approved in a tightly controlled national plebiscite in September 1980, under the [[military Junta|military]] [[government]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]]. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the Constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In 2005 over 50 reforms were approved, which eliminated the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (institutional senators, or senators for life) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.

The President is currently elected by the people to a 4-year term, the term was reduced from 6 years in 2005 which was in turn reduced from 8 years in the original 1980 constitution.

Chile's bicameral [[Congress of Chile|Congress]] has a 48-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]]—38 elected, 9 appointed, 1 for life—and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Deputies are elected every 4 years. Senators serve for 8 years with staggered terms. The current Senate is evenly split 24-24 between pro-government and opposition Senators. Nine institutional senators were appointed in 1999, and two "senators for life," former Presidents Pinochet (who resigned in 2002) and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle. (Chile's Constitution provided that former presidents who have served at least 6 years shall be entitled to a lifetime senate seat.) The last congressional elections were held in December 2001. The current lower house—the Chamber of Deputies—contains 60 members of the governing center-left coalition and 56 from the center-right opposition. Currently 4 Deputies have their voting rights suspended on legal grounds. The Congress is located in the port city of [[Valparaíso]], about 140 kilometers (84 mi.) west of the capital, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a unique binomial system that rewards coalition slates. Each coalition can run two candidates for the two Senate and two lower chamber seats apportioned to each chamber's electoral districts. Typically, the two largest coalitions split the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats. In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. The [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] again failed to gain any seats in the 2001 elections.[[Image:Chile.geohive.gif|thumb|270px|right|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]

In 2005, both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their allies Socialist Party (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. (''See'' [[Chilean presidential election, 2005]].) 

[[Michelle Bachelet]], a Socialist moderate, was elected President on [[January 15]], [[2006]], beating her closest rival [[Sebastián Piñera]].

Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a network of courts of appeals, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. Chile completed in mid-2005 a multi-year overhaul of its criminal justice system. The reform replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the [[United States]].

== Politico-administrative division ==
{{main|Regions of Chile}}

Chile is divided into 13 [[region]]s, each of which is headed by an ''intendente'' appointed by the President. Every region is further divided into [[province]]s with a ''Gobernador Provincial'', also appointed by the President. Finally each province  is divided into [[municipality|municipalities]].[http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/organigrama/organigrama.asp] which are sometimes refered to as [[comuna]]s, each with its own mayor, and [[councilor]]s, known as ''consejales'' elected by their inhabitants.

Each region is designated by a name and a [[Roman numeral]], assigned from north to south. In general, the Roman numeral is used, rather than the name. The only exception is the region where Santiago is situated, which is designated ''RM'', that stands for ''Región Metropolitana'', ''Metropolitan Region''.

In 2005, the Chilean congress passed a reform to create two new regions, one in the north, around the city of [[Arica]], and one in the south centered around [[Valdivia]] (aka Region of the Rivers). Being designated by numerals XIV and XV, both break the geographical numerical order from north to south. There is speculation that the numeral system will be dropped in favor of their formal names.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Chile}}
[[Image:Volcan Osorno.jpg|thumb|left|Osorno volcano]]

A long and narrow coastal [[Southern Cone]] country on the west side of the [[Andes]] Mountains, Chile stretches over 4,630 [[kilometre]]s (2,880&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) north to south, but only 430 kilometres (265&nbsp;mi) at its widest point east to west.

The northern [[Atacama]] desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and [[nitrate]]s. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands and features a string of [[volcano]]es and [[lake]]s. The southern coast is a labyrinth of [[fjord]]s, [[inlet]]s, [[canal]]s, twisting [[peninsula]]s, and [[island]]s. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest (N-S) country in the world (over 4,200&nbsp;km&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,600&nbsp;mi), and also claims 1,250,000 square kilometers (482,628&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]) of [[Antarctica]] as part of its territory.

Chile controls [[Easter Island|Easter]] and [[Sala-y-Gómez Island]]s, the easternmost islands of [[Polynesia]], which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], more than 600 kilometres (375&nbsp;mi) from the mainland, in the [[Juan Fernández]] archipelago. Also controlled but uninhabited are the small islands of Sala y Gomez, San Ambrosio and San Felix, these islands are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the Pacific.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Chile}}

After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile experienced a moderate downturn in 1999 brought on by the global economic slowdown. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 3.3% real [[Gross_domestic_product|GDP]] growth. The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6.1% and its economic growth in 2005 was 6.3%.

Chile has pursued generally sound economic policies for nearly three decades. The 1973-[[1990|90]] military government sold many state-owned companies, and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization at a slower pace. The government's role in the economy is mostly limited to regulation, although the state continues to operate copper giant [[Codelco]] and a few other enterprises. Chile is strongly committed to [[free trade]] and has welcomed large amounts of foreign investment. Chile has signed Free Trade agreements (FTAs) with several important economies, including an FTA with the United States, which was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004. High domestic savings and investment rates also helped propel Chile's economy to average growth rates of 8% during the 1990s. The privatized national [[pension]] system has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21% of GDP in 2003.

Unemployment has hovered in the 8%-10% range in recent years, well above the 5%-6% average for the 1990s. Unemployment remained at 8.8% at the end of 2004 in spite of strong economic growth. Wages have risen faster than inflation as a result of higher productivity, boosting national living standards. The share of Chileans with incomes below the poverty line--defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needs--fell from 46% of the population in 1987 to 18.8% in 2003.

Chile's independent [[Central Bank]] pursues a policy of maintaining [[inflation]] between 2% and 4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile registered inflation of 2.4% in 2004 and is expected to see a 2.5% increase in 2005. Most wage settlements and spending decisions are indexed, reducing inflation's volatility. Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.

Total foreign direct investment rose to $7.1 billion in 2004, up from $2.5 billion in 2003. Both foreign and domestic investment in Chile had declined during the country’s period of slower economic growth from 1999-2003, but appear to be recovering strongly. The Chilean Government committed, in early 2002, to undertake a series of [[microeconomy|microeconomic]] reforms designed to create new incentives for private investment. The government also has encouraged the use of Chile as an "investment platform" for multinational corporations planning to invest in the region. Chile's welcoming attitude toward foreign direct investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement offers a number of other investor protections.

===Foreign Trade ===
Chile's economy is highly dependent on international trade. In 2004, exports accounted for about 34% of GDP. Chile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports; the state-owned firm [[Codelco]] is the world's largest copper-producing company. Nontraditional exports have grown faster than those of copper and other minerals. In 1975, non-mineral exports made up just over 30% of total exports, whereas now they account for about 60%. The most important non-mineral exports are forestry and wood products, fresh [[fruit]] and processed [[food]], fishmeal and [[seafood]], and [[wine]]. The [[trade balance]] for 2005 showed a historic surplus $9,2 billion, slightly higher than 2004 and considerably higher than 2003. Total exports in 2005 were $39,4 billion, a 23.1% increase from $32 billion in 2004. Chile's export markets are fairly balanced among [[Europe]] (25.1%), [[Asia]] (33.1%), [[Latin America]] (15.7%), and [[North America]] (19%). The [[U.S.]], the largest national market, takes in 17.3% of Chile's exports. Asia has been the fastest-growing export market in recent years.

Chilean imports increased 31,7% in 2005, to $30,3 billion, reflecting a positive change in consumer demand and economic recovery. [[Capital goods]] made up about 66% of total imports. The United States represented 14.6% of Chilean imports in 2004. As a bloc, the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] in 2004 supplied 16.3% of Chile's imports, while Argentina contributed 16%. Chile unilaterally lowered its across-the-board [[import tariff]] for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement to 6% in 2003.

Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands. The price bands were ruled inconsistent with Chile's [[WTO]] obligations in 2002 and the government has introduced legislation to modify them. Chile will have to phase out the price bands within 12 years under the terms of the U.S.-Chile FTA.

Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued liberalizing trade agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed FTAs with [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and [[Central America]]. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]. An association agreement with [[Mercosur]]--[[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]]--went into effect in October 1996. Chile, a member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] ([[APEC]]) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and [[South Korea]]. After two years of negotiations, the United States and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003. The agreement will lead to completely duty free bilateral trade within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004 following approval by the U.S and Chilean congresses. Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA). Chile also has signed trade agreements with [[China]], as well as a four-party agreement with [[Singapore]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Brunei]] ([[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership|P4]]).

===Finance ===
Chile's financial sector has grown faster than other areas of the economy over the last few years; a banking reform law approved in 1997 broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001. Chileans have enjoyed the recent introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has been accompanied by increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards. Chile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $54 billion in late 2004, has provided an important source of investment capital for the capital market. Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings ([[Standard & Poor's]] A+) of countries in Latin America. There are three main ways Chilean firms raise funds abroad: bank loans, bond issue, and the selling of stock on U.S. markets through American Depository Receipts (ADR's). Nearly all of the funds raised go to finance investment. The government is paying off its foreign debt. The combined public and private foreign debt was roughly over 50% of GDP at the end of 2004—low by Latin American standards.

==Defense==
{{main|Military of Chile}}

Chile's Armed Forces are subject to [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]] exercised by the President through the Minister of Defense. Under the 1980 Constitution, the services enjoyed considerable autonomy, and the President could not remove service commanders on his own authority. However, reforms made in 2005 to the Constitution now give the President the right to remove the Commanders in Chief of the Armed Forces. All citizens are required to serve anywhere from 12 to 24 months in a branch of the military upon turning 18.  This service can be postponed for educational or religous reasons.

===Army ===
The commander in chief of the Chilean Army is Maj. Gen. [[Juan Emilio Cheyre]]. The Chilean Army is 45,000 strong and is organized with an Army headquarters in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], seven divisions throughout its territory, an Air Brigade in [[Rancagua]], and a [[Special Forces]] Command in Colina. It also operates [[Leopard I]] and [[AMX-30]] main battle tanks.negotiations are going on to buy 100 leopard 2A4 from the German Army. This because of the modernification plans for the army. The objectice is to upgrade most of the chilean army forces to NATO standard. The deployment of the army has also had some modifications. army infantry and armoured regiments have been re-equipped and joined with other units from the air-force and marine units , to form so called: re-enforced regiments. These re-enforced regiments are supposed to act as  fast deployment task forces.

===Navy===
Adm. Rodolfo Codina Díaz directs the 25,000-person Navy, including 5,000 Marines. Of the fleet of 29 surface vessels, only six are operational major combatants (destroyers and frigates). Those ships are based in Valparaíso. The Navy operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no Navy fighter or bomber aircraft. The Navy also operates three submarines based in Talcahuano.

===Air Force (FACH)===
Gen. Osvaldo Sarabia heads a force of 12,500. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in Iquique, Antofagasta, Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas. The Air Force also operates an airbase on [[King George Island]], [[Antarctica]]. The FACH will begin taking delivery of 10 U.S. [[F-16]] aircraft in 2006, and a contract for 18 used [[F-16]] more has been signed with Holland.

===Police Forces===
After the military coup in September 1973, the Chilean national police (Carabineros) were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the Carabineros were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen. Alberto Cienfuegos is the head of the national police force of 30,000 men and women who are responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, narcotics suppression, border control and counter-terrorism throughout Chile.

In addition to the Carabineros, who are part of the military, Chile also has the Policia de Investigaciones, a police force composed of civilians which is similar in purpose to the FBI. It is a special arm of the Public Ministry whose main task is to investigate crimes and apprehend the suspects once firm evidence has been established. Mr Arturo Herrera heads the Policia de Investigaciones. In addition to investigating crimes, the Policia de Investigaciones also complements the functions Carabineros in times of civil unrest, and is in charge of all immigration procedures. Although not a de-facto mandate in it's mission, the Policia de Investigaciones keeps an eye on the Carabineros in order to weed out corruption, Carabineros reciprocates the duty and both institutions have exposed corrupt officials within their counterpart.

==Foreign relations==

Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Chile is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities. Chile hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002 and the [[APEC]] summit and related meetings in 2004. Chile hosted the Community of Democracies ministerial in April 2005. An associate member of Mercosur and a full member of APEC, Chile and has been an important actor on international economic issues and hemispheric free trade.

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to reacquire territory it lost to Chile in 1879-83 [[War of the Pacific]]. The two countries maintain consular relations.

== Demographics ==

{{main|Demographics of Chile}}
[[Image:Chile-demography.png|300px|thumb|right|Population of Chile from 1950, projected up to 2050 (INE)]]

Unlike some of its South American neighbours, Chile is a relatively homogenous country. Around 95% of Chileans descend from early Spanish colonists, with the overwhelming part also possessing Native American ancestry in varying degrees, and thus deeming the population majority (93%) as [[mestizo]]. The main body of Chile's mestizo majority, however, is one where the average Spanish input is somewhat greater than in neighbouring Andean mestizo populations. People of relatively unmixed Spanish ancestry are not uncommon, and up to 30% could be classified as [[White (people)|white]] on the basis of [[phenotype]]. The unmixed white population is estimated between 2% and 5%.

Today, people that self-identify solely as members of any of the country's many indigenous groups and belong to an officially recognised ethnic group (groups that still practise and speak their indigenous culture and language) number 4.6% of the population, or 692,192 individuals. [http://www.ine.cl/cd2002/sintesiscensal.pdf] Of those 692,192; 87.3% are [[Mapuche]] [[Amerindians]] that reside mainly in the south-central area of the country. The indigenous [[Aymara]] and [[Quechua|Quechua-speaking]] Amerindian populations live along the northern border with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. There are also around 5,000 polynesian people who are indigenous to the Chilean territory of Easter Island ([[Rapanui]]) in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Throughout much of Chile's modern history there has been a slow but steady work related [[Andes|trans-Andean]] migration to Chile — primarily from [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] — due mostly to the economic situation of its neighbours. Peruvians have historically constituted the largest immigrant group of the country. However, Argentina's eventual [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|economic collapse in 2001]] caused such an escalation in their migratory influx into Chile, that by 2005 Argentinians comprised the largest immigrant group, outnumbering Peruvians. {{citationneeded}}

Chileans descended from non-Spanish European immigrants are not numerous, but include a small yet influential number of descendants of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[English people|English]] immigrants which arrived in Chile during the Spanish colonial period and descendants of English immigrants, arrived during and after independence (mainly merchants and sailors). A government-sponsored immigration from Germany began in 1848, and in time, changed the cultural makeup of the southern provinces of [[Valdivia]], [[Llanquihue]], and [[Osorno]], which still show a strong German influence. Other historically significant immigrant groups include people of Italian ancestry ([[Valparaíso Region]]), Croatian ([[Antofagasta, Chile|Antofagasta]] and [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]]), [[France|French]], and [[Poland|Polish]] backgrounds. There are also people from [[Middle East]]ern and [[North Africa]]n backgrounds, including the second largest [[Palestinian]] colony outside of the Middle East. In the last decade there has been an influx of [[Korea]]ns who settled in small sections of [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. During these same periods, the volume of immigration from neighbouring countries has been of a simmilar value.

Although the combined number of immigrants never comprised a large segment of the population, they nevertheless contributed greatly to Chilean society and the development of the nation. Most retained their traditions, cultures and national affiliations by maintaining close-knit communities — although many also mixed into the majority — while at the same time co-existed peacefully with the host population.

About 85% of Chile's population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in [[Santiago de Chile|Greater Santiago]].

Chile's population growth is among the lowest in Latin America, at around 0.97%, it comes third only to [[Uruguay]] and [[Cuba]].

== Culture ==
[[Image:Pablo Neruda profile.jpg|150px|thumb|Pablo Neruda was Chile's second winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]
{{main|Culture of Chile}}

Northern Chile was an important center of culture in the medieval and early modern Inca empire. Afterwards, their culture was dominated by the Spanish during the Colonial and early Republican period. Other European influences, primarily English and French, began in the 19th century and have continued until today, as in other Western societies.

The national dance is the cueca. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the [[Parra family]] with the [[Nueva Canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]], which was associated with political activists and reformers.

Chileans call their country ''País de Poetas'' which means land of poets. [[Gabriela Mistral]], was the first Chilean to win a Nobel Prize for literature. Chile's most famous poet, however, is [[Pablo Neruda]], who also won the Nobel Prize and is world-renowned for his extensive library of works on romance, nature, and politics. His three highly individualistic homes, located in Isla Negra, Santiago and Valparaiso are popular tourist destinations. <br clear="all" />

==National symbols==
[[Image:Lapageria_rosea.jpg|150px|thumb|A red copihue]]

The national flower is the [[copihue]] (''Lapageria rosea'', Chilean bellflower), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.

[[Image:Chile_COA.jpg|thumb|left|Chile's Coat of Arms]]

The [[coat of arms]] depicts the two national animals: the [[condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the [[huemul]] (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend ''Por la razón o la fuerza'' (''By right or might'' or ''By reason or by force''). <br/>
