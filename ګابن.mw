The '''Gabonese Republic''' or '''Gabon''', is a nation of west central [[Africa]].  It borders on [[اېکواټوريال ګوينا]], [[کېمرون]], [[د کانګو جمهوريت]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Since its independence from [[France]] on [[August 17]], [[1960]], the Republic has been ruled by only two [[Autocracy|autocratic]] Presidents; the incumbent [[Omar Bongo|El Hadj Omar Bongo]] has been in power since [[1967]] and is currently (2006) Africa's longest-serving Head of State. Gabon introduced a multiparty system and a new democratic constitution in the early [[1990s]] that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and for reforms of governmental institutions. A small population, abundant natural resources, and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous countries in the region.
== History ==
{{Main|History of Gabon}}
The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Pygmy]] peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes during [[Bantu]] [[human migration|migrations]]. Several [[Bantu]] groups occupied the area that is now Gabon when [[France]] occupied it in [[1885]]. In [[1910]], Gabon became one of the four territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], a federation that survived until [[1959]]. These territories became independent on [[August 17]], [[1960]].

The first president of Gabon, elected in 1961, was [[Léon M’ba]], with [[Omar Bongo]] as his vice president. When M'Ba died in 1967, Bongo replaced him as president, and has been the head of state ever since winning each contested election with a substantial majority.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Gabon}}
[[دوتنه:Omar_Bongo_with_George_Bush_May_26_2004-02.jpg|thumb|left| President [[Omar Bongo]] Ondimba of Gabon (left) in Washington, USA]]In March 1991 a new constitution was adopted. Among its provisions are a Western-style bill of rights, the creation of the National Council of Democracy that also oversees the guarantee of those rights and a governmental advisory board which deals with economic and social issues. Multi-party legislative elections were held in 1990-91 even though opposition parties had not been declared formally legal. 

President [[Omar Bongo|El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba]], in power since [[1967]] and the longest-serving African head of state, was re-elected to another 7-year term according to poll results returned from elections held on [[November 27]] [[2005]]. According to figures provided by Gabon's Interior Ministry, this was achieved with 79.1% of the votes cast. In [[2003]] the President amended the [[Constitution of Gabon]] to remove any restictions on the number of terms a president is allowed to serve. The president retains strong powers, such as authority to dissolve the National Assembly, declare a state of siege, delay legislation, conduct referenda, and appoint and dismiss the prime minister and cabinet members.

In provisional results his ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] (PDG) won 84 out of 120 parliamentary seats. As with previous Gabonese elections in which the opposition parties have contested, there were several accusations of electoral fraud, bribery, and calls for a boycott. There were also incidences of violence and protest, particularly in the first round of voting held two weeks prior. However, several international observers including the Economic Community of Central African States have reported that the election "met international standards" for [[democracy|democratic]] voting.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main articles|[[Provinces of Gabon]] and [[Departments of Gabon]]}}

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Gabon}}
[[دوتنه:Chancery.jpg|thumb|Chancery building, [[Libreville]]]]Gabon is located on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of central Africa. Clockwise from the northwest, it is bounded by [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], and the [[Republic of Congo]].
Gabon's largest river is the [[Ogooué]]. Gabon is also noted for efforts to preserve the natural environment with what may be the largest area of [[nature parks]] in the world.

Administratively, Gabon is divided into 9 provinces and further divided into 37 departments (''départements'').

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Gabon}}
[[دوتنه:Gabon-CIA_WFB_Map.png|thumb|right|270px|Map of Gabon]]Gabon is more prosperous than most nearby countries, with a [[per capita income]] of four times the average for [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. This is in large part due to offshore [[petroleum|oil]] production that has produced substantial wealth, although the distribution of income from this industry is extremely unequal.  Gabon was a full member of [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries|OPEC]] from 1975 to 1995.

During the 1990s, [[devaluation]] of  the [[CFA franc]] left Gabon struggling to pay its overseas [[Third World debt|debt]]; [[France]] and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] have provided further loans and aid in exchange for the implementation of changes to the economy.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Gabon}}
Almost all Gabonese are of [[Bantu]] origin. Gabon has at least 40 [[ethnic group]]s with separate languages and cultures. The largest is the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]]. Others include the [[Myene]], [[Bandjabi]], [[Eshira]], [[Bapounou]], and [[Okande]].  Ethnic group boundaries are less sharply drawn in Gabon than elsewhere in [[Africa]]. [[French language|French]], the [[official language]], is a unifying force. More than 10,000 [[French people]] live in Gabon, and France predominates foreign cultural and commercial influences. Historical and environmental factors caused Gabon's population to decline between [[1900]] and [[1940]]. It is one of the least-densely inhabited countries in Africa, and a labor shortage is a major obstacle to development and a draw for foreign workers. The population is generally accepted to be just over 1 million but remains in dispute.
