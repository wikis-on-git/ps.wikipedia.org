'''Laos''', officially the '''Lao People's [[Democratic Republic]]''', is a [[landlocked]] [[socialist republic]] in [[southeast Asia]], bordered by [[ماينامار(برما)|ماينامار]] (also known as Burma) and [[چين]] to the northwest, [[وېتنام]] to the east, [[کمبوډيا]] to the south, and [[تايلېنډ]] to the west. Laos traces its history to the Kingdom of [[Lan Xang]] or ''Land of A Million Elephants'', which existed from the 14th to the 18th century. The flag of the Kingdom of Laos featured the [[Erawan]], a mythical white three headed elephant. The current national flag was first used by the short-lived Lao nationalist government of 1945 and was restored by the Lao [[communist]] government in 1975.

== Terminology ==
The country's name in the [[Lao language]] is 'Meuang Lao'. The [[France|French]], who made the country part of [[French Indochina]] in [[1893]], spelled it with the ''s'' which is usually retained in the spelling and pronunciation of the English name (pronounced as one syllable). The usual adjectival form is "Lao" (as in 'the Lao economy'), not 'Laotian', although the latter is commonly used to describe the people of Laos (to avoid confusion with the [[Lao people|Lao ethnic group]]).

== History ==
{{main|History of Laos}}

Laos traces its history to the kingdom of [[Lan Xang]], founded in the 14th century, which lasted until the [[18th century]], when [[Thailand|Siam]] assumed control of the separate [[principality|principalities]] that remained.  To avoid a costly war with the French, the Siamese king ceded lands now known as Laos to them, and these were incorporated into [[French Indochina]] in [[1893]]. Following a brief [[Japan]]ese occupation during [[World War II]], the country declared its independence in [[1945]], but the French re-asserted their control and only in 1950 was Laos granted semi-autonomy as an "associated state" within the French Union. Moreover, the French remained in ''de facto'' control until 1954, when Laos gained full independence as a constitutional monarchy.

Political unrest in neighbouring [[Vietnam]] dragged Laos into the [[Indochina War|Second Indochina War]] (''see also [[Secret War]] and [[Vietnam War]]''), a destabilising factor that contributed to [[civil war]] and several [[coup d'état|coups d'état]]. The North Vietnamese Army invaded and occupied portions of eastern Laos. The North Vietnamese army, with its heavy weapons including heavy artillery and tanks was the real power behind the Pathet Lao insurgency. Significant aerial bombardment by the United States occurred by that country's attempt to eliminate North Vietnamese bases in Laos and disrupt supply lines on the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].

In [[1968]] the North Vietnamese Army launched a multi-division attack against the Royal Lao Army. The attack resulted in the army largely demobilizing and leaving the conflict to irregular forces raised by the United States and Thailand. In [[1975]] the [[communist]] [[Pathet Lao]], backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and the North Vietnamese Army (justified by the Communist ideology of "proletarian internationalism"), overthrew the royalist government, forcing King [[Savang Vatthana]] to abdicate on [[December 2]] [[1975]] (he later died in captivity). After taking control of the country, they renamed it the ''Lao People's Democratic Republic''. The Pathet Lao government afterward signed agreements giving Vietnam the right to station military forces and to appoint advisors to assist in overseeing the country. Laos was ordered in the late 1970s by Vietnam to end relations with [[China]] which cut the country off from trade with any country but Vietnam {{citation needed}}. Control by Vietnam and socialisation were slowly replaced by a relaxation of economic restrictions in the [[1980s]] and admission into [[ASEAN]] in [[1997]]. Vietnam still wields political and economic influence in Laos.

The 20-year embargo by the United States was lifted in [[1995]], although Laos has still not achieved [[Most Favored Nation]] trading status (along with [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], and [[Vietnam]], although Vietnam holds a separate trading accord). Lack of this status is often considered to be the result of [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugee activism in the United States which targets [http://www.laohumrights.org/home.html human rights violations by the Lao government].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Laos}}
The only legal [[political party]] is the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] (LPRP). The [[head of state]] is the [[President]], elected by parliament for a five-year term. The [[head of government]] is the [[prime minister]], appointed by the president with parliamentary approval. Government policies are determined by the party through the all-powerful nine-member [[Politburo]] and the 49-member Central Committee. Important government decisions are vetted by the Council of Ministers.

Laos adopted a new [[constitution]] in [[1991]]. The following year, elections were held for a new 85-seat National Assembly with members elected by secret ballot to 5-year terms. This unicameral [[parliament]], expanded in the [[1997]] elections to 99 members, approves all new laws, although the [[executive branch]] retains authority to issue binding decrees. The most recent elections took place in February 2002 when the assembly was expanded to 115 members.

Remnants of a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] group allied with the United States during the Vietnam War have been in armed conflict with the communist regime since 1975. With recent surrenders reported in the international media, this conflict appears to be on the wane. Most Hmong are integrated into or at least at peace with society, with some occupying high-ranking positions in the state system.

Attacks continue to take place sporadically throughout the country, but are difficult to attribute to a specific political movement. All dissent in Laos is suppressed, so information is difficult to obtain.

== Administrative Divisions ==
{{main|Provinces of Laos}}
[[دوتنه:Laos provinces.png|right|Provinces of Laos]]
Laos is divided into 16 [[province]]s (''khoueng''), 1 municipality* (''kampheng nakhon''), and 1 special zone** (''khetphiset''):
# [[Attapu Province|Attapu]]
# [[Bokeo]]
# [[Borikhamxay]]
# [[Champassack]]
# [[Houaphan]]
# [[Khammouane]]
# [[Louang Namtha Province|Louang Namtha]]
# [[Louangphabang Province|Louangphabang]]
# [[Oudomxay]]
# [[Phongsali Province|Phongsaly]]
# [[Salavan Province|Saravane]]
# [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet]]
# [[Vientiane Prefecture|Vientiane]] *
# [[Vientiane Province]]
# [[Xaignabouli Province|Sayaboury]]
# [[Saysomboun]] **
# [[Xekong Province|Xekong]]
# [[Xiangkhoang Province|Xieng Khouang]]

Laos is further subdivided into [[district]]s (''muong'').

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:La-map.png|thumb|Map of Laos]]
{{main|Geography of Laos}}

Laos is a landlocked country in [[Southeast Asia]] and the thickly forested landscape consists mostly of rugged mountains, the highest of which is [[Phou Bia]] at 9,242 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (2,817&nbsp;m), with some plains and plateaus. The [[Mekong]] River forms a large part of the western boundary with [[Thailand]], whereas the mountains of the [[Annamite Chain]] form most of the eastern border with [[Vietnam]].

The [[climate]] is tropical and characterised by [[monsoon]]s. There is a distinct rainy season from May to November, followed by a dry season from December to April. The capital and largest city of Laos is [[Vientiane]], and other major cities include [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet (city)|Savannakhet]] and [[Pakse]].

In 1993, the government set aside 21% of the nation's land area as [[National Biodiversity Conservation Areas]] (NBCA), which may be developed into a national park system. If completed, it is expected to be the most comprehensive and one of the finest national park systems in [[Southeast Asia]].

A number of animal species have been discovered or re-discovered in Laos in recent years. These include the striped or [[Annamite rabbit]], the [[saola]], and most recently the [[Laotian rock rat]] or ''kha-nyou''.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Laos}}

The government of Laos - one of the few remaining official [[socialist state]]s - began decentralising control and encouraging private enterprise in [[1986]]. The results, starting from an extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 6% in [[1988]]-[[2004]] except during the short-lived drop caused by the [[Asian financial crisis]] beginning in [[1997]]. As in many developing countries, the major urban centers have experienced the most growth. The economies of [[Vientiane]], [[Luang Prabang]] and [[Savannakhet]] in particular have experienced significant booms in recent years. Laos' economy is heavily dependent on investment and trade with its larger and richer cousin, [[Thailand]]. [[Pakxe]] has also experienced growth. 

Much of the country, however, lacks adequate [[infrastructure]]. Laos has no [[railway]]s, although a short link is planned to connect Vientiane with Thailand over the [[Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge]]. The major roads connecting the major urban centres, mainly forming Route 13, have been significantly upgraded in recent years, but villages that are far from major roads are accessible only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year-round. There is limited external and internal [[telecommunication]], particularly of the wire line sort, but mobile cellular phone usage has become widespread in urban centres. In many rural areas electricity is either not available or offered only during scheduled periods. Subsistence [[agriculture]] still accounts for half of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] and provides 80% of total employment. The economy receives aid from the [[IMF]] and other international sources and from new foreign investment in food-processing and [[mining]], most notably of copper and gold. [[Tourism]] is the fastest growing industry in the country. However, economic development in general is hampered by a serious case of [[brain drain]]. A 2005 World Bank study reported that 37% of educated Laotians lived abroad, putting the country in 5th place for worst brain drain. 

In late 2004, Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US, allowing Laos-based producers to face lower tariffs on their exports; this may help spur growth.

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:Markt Luang Prabang.jpg|thumb|250px|A street market in Luang Prabang]]
{{main|Demographics of Laos}}
60% of the country's people are ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]], the principal lowland inhabitants and the politically and culturally dominant group. The Lao belong to the [[Tai]] linguistic group who began migrating southward from [[China]] in the first millennium AD. A further 8% belong to other "lowland" groups, which together with the Lao people make up the [[Lao Loum]]. Hill people such as the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] (Miao), [[Yao people|Yao]] (Mien), [[Black Thai]], [[Dao]], [[Shan]], and several [[Tibeto-Burman]] speaking peoples have lived in isolated regions of Laos for many years. Mountain tribes of mixed ethno-linguistic heritage are found in northern Laos. Collectively, they are known as [[Lao Soung]] or highland Laotians. In the central and southern mountains, [[Mon people|Mon]]-[[Khmer people|Khmer]] tribes, known as [[Lao Theung]] or mid-slope Laotians, predominate. Some [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[ethnic Chinese|Chinese]] minorities remain, particularly in the towns, but many left in two waves; after independence in the late 1940s and again after 1975.

The term ''Laotian'' does not necessarily refer to the ethnic Lao language, ethnic Lao people, language or customs, but is a political term that also includes the non-ethnic Lao groups within Laos and identifies them as "Laotian" because of their political citizenship. In a similar vein the word "Lao" can also describe the people, cuisine, language and culture of the people of [[Northeast Thailand]] ([[Isan]]) who are ethnic Lao.

The predominant religion is [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] which, along with the common [[Animism]] practiced among the mountain tribes, coexists peacefully with spirit worship. There also are a small number of [[Christianity|Christians]], mostly restricted to the Vientiane area, and [[Islam|Muslims]], mostly restricted to the Myanmar border region. Christian missionary work is regulated by the government. 

The official and dominant language is Lao, a tonal language of the [[Tai]] linguistic group. Midslope and highland Lao speak an assortment of tribal languages. French, once common in government and commerce, has declined in usage, while knowledge of English, the language of the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), has increased in recent years.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Laos}}
[[دوتنه:Gargoyles Revenge.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gargoyle]]s outside a temple in [[Luang Prabang]]]]

[[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] is a dominant influence in Lao culture. It is reflected throughout the country from language to the temple and in art, literature, performing arts, etc. Many elements of Lao culture predate Buddhism, however. For example, Laotian [[music]] is dominated by its national [[musical instrument|instrument]], the [[khaen]], a type of [[bamboo]] [[Pan pipes|pipe]] that has prehistoric origins. The khaen traditionally accompanied the singer in ''[[mor lam|lam]]'', the dominant style of [[folk music]]; there are several different styles of ''lam'', some, such as ''[[lam saravane]]'', being more popular than others.
[[دوتنه:PICT3655.JPG|thumb|left|Wat [[Ho Pra Keo]], Vientiane]]
The country has two [[World Heritage site]]s — [[Luang Prabang]] and [[Wat Phou]] — while the government is seeking the same status for the [[Plain of Jars]].

[[China]] has recently allowed its citizens to travel more freely to Laos. As such, Chinese [[tourists]] are expected to account for 25% of the total number of visitors to Laos (up from only a few percent) in 2006. Pressures to modernize tourist infrastructure, particularly to cater to package tourism, are expected to significantly impact Luang Prabang and other culturally important Laotian cities.

== Media ==
{{main|Media of Laos}}

All newspapers are published by the government, including two foreign language papers: the English language ''[[Vientiane Times]]'' and the French language ''[[Le Rénovateur]]''. Additionally, the [[Khao San Pathet Lao]], the official news agency of the Lao P.D.R., publishes English and French versions of its eponymous paper. Internet cafes, serving the tourist market, are now common in the major urban centres. However, the government strictly censors content and controls access.

Satellite television dishes, beaming content from Thailand, are common throughout Laos. Many Laotians access the outside world through Thai television programs.
