Uzbekistan is approximately the size of [[Morocco]] and has an [[area]] of {{km2 to mi2|447400|precision=-2|wiki=yes}}. It is the 56th largest country in the world by area and the 42nd by population.<ref>[http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/populations/ctypopls.htm www.worldatlas.com]</ref> Among the [[CIS]] countries, it is the 5th largest by area and the 3rd largest by population.<ref name=uzstat/>

Uzbekistan stretches {{km to mi|1425}} from west to east and {{km to mi|930}} from north to south. Bordering [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Aral Sea]] to the north and northwest, [[Turkmenistan]] to the southwest, [[Tajikistan]] to the southeast, and [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the northeast, Uzbekistan is not only one of the larger [[Central Asian]] states but also the only Central Asian state to border all the other four. Uzbekistan also shares a short border (less than 150&nbsp;km) with [[Afghanistan]] to the south.

Uzbekistan is a dry, [[landlocked]] country; it is one of two doubly landlocked countries in the world, i.e., a country completely surrounded by landlocked countries – the other being [[Liechtenstein]]. Less than 10% of its territory is intensively cultivated irrigated land in river valleys and oases. The rest is vast desert ([[Kyzyl Kum]]) and mountains. 

The highest point in Uzbekistan is the [[Khazret Sultan]], located at {{m to ft|4643}} above sea level, located in the southern part of the [[Gissar Range]] in [[Surkhandarya Province]], on the border with [[Tajikistan]], just north-west of [[Dushanbe]] (formerly called ''Peak of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party'').<ref name=uzstat>[http://enews.ferghana.ru/article.php?id=2051 Uzbelkistan will publish its own book of records - Ferghana.ru], accessed on July 29, 2009.</ref>

The [[climate]] in the Republic of Uzbekistan is continental, with little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] expected annually (100–200 millimeters, or 3.9–7.9 inches). The average summer high [[temperature]] tends to be 40&nbsp;°C {{nowrap|(104 °F)}}, while the average winter low temperature is around −23&nbsp;°C {{nowrap|(−9 °F)}}.<ref name="LoC:Climate">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+uz0029) Climate], Uzbekistan : Country Studies - Federal Research Division, Library of Congress.</ref>

Major cities include [[Bukhara]], [[Samarqand]], [[Namangan]] and the capital [[Tashkent]].

[[File:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|Alexander at the Battle of Issos]]

The first people known to have occupied Central Asia were [[Iranians|Iranian]] nomads who arrived from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan sometime in the first millennium BC. These nomads, who spoke Iranian dialects, settled in Central Asia and began to build an extensive irrigation system along the rivers of the region. At this time, cities such as Bukhoro (Bukhara) and Samarqand (Samarkand) began to appear as centers of government and culture. By the [[5th century BC]], the [[Bactria]]n, [[Sogdiana|Soghdian]], and [[Yuezhi|Tokharian]] states dominated the region. As China began to develop its silk trade with the West, Iranian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centers of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and settlements in the province of Mawarannahr (a name given the region after the Arab conquest) in Uzbekistan and farther east in what is today China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Soghdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. Because of this trade on what became known as the Silk Route, Bukhoro and Samarqand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times Mawarannahr was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.<ref name=eh>Lubin, Nancy. "Early history". In Curtis.</ref>

[[File:Registan - Sherdor madrasa.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Registan]]]]
[[File:У крепостной стены.jpg|thumb|left|The Russians taking over the city of Khiva]]
[[Alexander the Great]] conquered [[Sogdiana]] and [[Bactria]] in 327 BC, marrying [[Roxana]], daughter of a local Bactrian chieftain. The conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by Iranian empires, including the [[Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires. 

The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest under [[Genghis Khan]] during the 13th century, would bring about a dramatic change to the region. The brutal conquest and widespread genocide characteristic of the Mongols almost entirely exterminated the indigenous Indo-Iranian ([[Scythian]]) people of the region. Their culture and heritage being superseded by that of the Mongolian-Turkic peoples who settled the region thereafter. 

Following the death of Chinggis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, Mongol law of the [[Mongol Empire]] maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Mawarannahr stayed in the hands of direct descendants of Chaghatai, the second son of Chinggis. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained strong and united.<ref name=rt>Lubin, Nancy. "Rule of Timur". In Curtis.</ref>

In the early fourteenth century, however, as the empire began to break up into its constituent parts, the Chaghatai territory also was disrupted as the princes of various tribal groups competed for influence. One tribal chieftain, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Mawarannahr. Although he was not a descendant of Chinggis, Timur became the de facto ruler of Mawarannahr and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia, Iran, Asia Minor, and the southern steppe region north of the Aral Sea. He also invaded Russia before dying during an invasion of China in 1405.<ref name=rt/>

Timur initiated the last flowering of Mawarannahr by gathering in his capital, Samarqand, numerous artisans and scholars from the lands he had conquered. By supporting such people, Timur imbued his empire with a very rich culture. During Timur's reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction projects were undertaken in Samarqand and other population centers. Timur also patronized scientists and artists; his grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkish, in the form of the Chaghatai dialect, became a literary language in its own right in Mawarannahr—although the Timurids also patronized writing in Persian. Until then only Persian had been used in the region. The greatest Chaghataid writer, Ali Shir Nava'i, was active in the city of Herat, now in northwestern Afghanistan, in the second half of the fifteenth century.<ref name=rt/>

The Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the Uzbek nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501 the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr.<ref name=rt/>

In the nineteenth century, the [[Russian Empire]] began to expand and spread into [[Central Asia]]. The "[[Great Game]]" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]]. Following the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, a second, less intensive phase followed. At the start of the nineteenth century, there were some 2,000 miles (3,200&nbsp;km) separating [[British India]] and the outlying regions of [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]]. Much of the land in between was unmapped.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Central Asia was firmly in the hands of Russia, and despite some early resistance to [[Bolsheviks]], Uzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia became a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. On 27 October 1924 the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created. On 31 August 1991, Uzbekistan declared independence, marking 1 September as a national holiday.

The country is now the world's second-largest exporter of [[cotton]], and it is developing its [[mineral]] and [[petroleum]] reserves.

{{Main|Politics of Uzbekistan}}
[[Image:Islam karimov cropped.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Islam Karimov]] – President of Uzbekistan]]
[[Image:Oliy Majlis (Parliament of Uzbekistan).jpg|thumb|left|Uzbek parliament]]
Constitutionally, the Government of Uzbekistan provides for democracy. The [[executive (government)|executive]] holds a great deal of power, and the [[legislative|legislature]] and [[judiciary]] have little power to shape laws.  Under terms of a December 27, 1995 referendum, [[Islam Karimov]]'s first term was extended. Another national referendum was held 27 January 2002 to extend the Constitutional Presidential term from 5 years to 7 years. 

The referendum passed, and Karimov's term was extended by act of the parliament to December 2007. Most international observers refused to participate in the process and did not recognize the results, dismissing them as not meeting basic standards. The 2002 referendum also included a plan to create a bicameral parliament, consisting of a lower house (the ''Oliy Majlis'') and an upper house (Senate). Members of the lower house are to be "full time" legislators. Elections for the new bicameral parliament took place on 26 December, but no truly independent opposition candidates or parties were able to take part. 

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] limited observation mission concluded that the elections fell significantly short of OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections. Several political parties have been formed with government approval. Similarly, although multiple media outlets (radio, TV, newspaper) have been established, these either remain under government control or rarely broach political topics. Independent political parties were allowed to organize, recruit members and hold conventions and press conferences, but they have been denied registration under restrictive registration procedures.

== Human rights ==
{{Main|Human rights in Uzbekistan}}

The Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan asserts that "democracy in the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be based upon common human principles, according to which the highest value shall be the human being, his life, freedom, honor, dignity and other inalienable rights."

However, [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] human rights watchdogs, such as [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|IHF]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], as well as [[United States Department of State]] and [[Council of the European Union]] define Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with limited civil rights"<ref>US Department of State, [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/sca/119143.htm 2008 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Uzbekistan], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, February 25, 2009</ref> and express profound concern about "wide-scale violation of virtually all basic human rights".<ref>[[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|IHF]], [http://www.ihf-hr.org/documents/doc_summary.php?sec_id=3&d_id=3860 Human Rights in OSCE Region: Europe, Central Asia and North America - Uzbekistan, Report 2004 (events of 2003)], 2004-06-23</ref>
According to the reports, the most widespread violations are [[torture]], arbitrary [[arrest]]s,
and various restrictions of freedoms: of religion, of speech and press, of free association and assembly.<ref>[[OMCT]] and [[Legal Aid Society]], [http://www.omct.org/pdf/omct_europe/2005/omct-las_uzb_report_04_05.pdf Denial of justice in Uzbekistan - an assessment of the human rights situation and national system of protection of fundamental rights], April 2005.</ref>
The reports maintain that the violations are most often committed against members of religious organizations, independent journalists, human rights activists and political activists, including members of the banned opposition parties.
In 2005, Uzbekistan was included into [[Freedom House]]'s "The Worst of the Worst: The World's Most Repressive Societies."

The official position is summarized in a memorandum "The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights"<ref>Embassy of Uzbekistan to the US, [http://www.uzbekistan.org/press/archive/283/ Press-Release: "The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights"], October 24, 2005</ref> and amounts to the following: the government does everything that is in its power to protect and to guarantee the human rights of Uzbekistan's citizens. Uzbekistan continuously improves its laws and institutions in order to create a more humane society. Over 300 laws regulating the rights and basic freedoms of the people have been passed by the parliament. For instance, an office of [[Ombudsman]] was established in 1996.<ref> Uzbekistan Daily Digest, [http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/uzbekistan/hypermail/200304/0029.shtml "Uzbekistan's Ombudsman reports on 2002 results"], December 25, 2007</ref> On 2 August 2005, President Islam Karimov signed a decree that was to abolish capital punishment in Uzbekistan on 1 January 2008.

The [[2005 civil unrest in Uzbekistan]], which resulted in several hundred people being killed, is viewed by many as a landmark event in the history of human rights abuse in Uzbekistan,<ref>http://usinfo.state.gov/eur/Archive/2005/Sep/26-966275.html</ref><ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/06/53b15c1e-995c-4339-819c-8090fbc94736.html Uzbekistan: Report Cites Evidence Of Government 'Massacre' In Andijon - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR620152005?open&of=ENG-UZB Uzbekistan: Independent international investigation needed into Andizhan events | Amnesty International<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
A concern has been expressed and a request for an independent investigation of the events has been made by the United States, European Union, the [[UN]], the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.
The government of Uzbekistan is accused of unlawful termination of human life and of denying its citizens freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The government vehemently rebuffs the accusations, maintaining that it merely conducted an anti-terrorist operation, exercising only necessary force.<ref>[http://www.press-service.uz/en/gsection.scm?groupId=5203&contentId=8868 Press-service of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In addition, some officials claim that "an information war on Uzbekistan has been declared" and the human rights violations in Andijan are invented by the enemies of Uzbekistan as a convenient pretext for intervention into the country's internal affairs.<ref>[http://www.kreml.org/interview/100931204 Kreml.Org | Андижанские события стали поводом для беспрецедентного давления на Узбекистан]</ref>

[[Image:Samarkand view from the top.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samarkand]]]]
Along with many [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] economies, Uzbekistan's economy declined during the first years of transition and then recovered after 1995, as the cumulative effect of policy reforms began to be felt. It has shown robust growth, rising by 4% per year between 1998 and 2003 and accelerating thereafter to 7%-8% per year. According to IMF estimates,<ref name=imf>[http://www.imf.org/external/data.htm IMF World Economic Outlook Database], October 2007</ref> the GDP in 2008 will be almost double its value in 1995 (in constant prices). Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10%.

Uzbekistan has a very low [[Gross National Income|GNI]] per capita (US$610 in current dollars in 2006, giving a [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] equivalent of US$2,250).<ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GNIPC.pdf GNI per capita 2006, Atlas method and PPP], World Development Indicators database, World Bank, 14 September 2007.</ref> By GNI per capita in PPP equivalents Uzbekistan ranks 169 among 209 countries; among the 12 [[CIS]] countries, only Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan had lower GNI per capita in 2006. Economic production is concentrated in commodities: Uzbekistan is now the world's sixth-largest producer and second-largest exporter of cotton,<ref>[http://www.icac.org/cotton_info/publications/samples/weekly_estimates/8february05.pdf ''Cotton This Week'', International Cotton Advisory Committee, February 2005.]</ref> as well as the seventh largest world producer of gold. It is also a regionally significant producer of natural gas, coal, copper, oil, silver and uranium.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/profiles/uzbekistan.asp#info IRIN | Country Profile | Uzbekistan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

[[Agriculture in Uzbekistan|Agriculture]] employs 28% of Uzbekistan's labor force and contributes 24% of its GDP (2006 data).<ref name=uzstat/> While official unemployment is very low, underemployment – especially in rural areas – is estimated to be at least 20%.<ref name=cia1/> Still, at cotton-harvest time, all students and teachers are mobilized as unpaid labour to help in the fields.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/7068096.stm BBC NEWS | Programmes | Newsnight | Child labour and the High Street<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The use of child labor in Uzbekistan has led several companies, including Tesco,<ref>[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/Uzbekistan_Cotton%20Tesco_letter_to_%20suppliers.pdf ''Tesco: Raw cotton sourcing'', letter to suppliers, January 7, 2008.]</ref> C&A,<ref>[http://www.c-and-a.com/aboutUs/socialResponsibility/ C&A Code of Conduct for Uzbekistan.]</ref> Marks & Spencer, Gap, and H&M, to boycott Uzbek cotton.<ref>{{cite news

Facing a multitude of economic challenges upon acquiring independence, the government adopted an evolutionary reform strategy, with an emphasis on state control, reduction of imports and self-sufficiency in energy. Since 1994, the state-controlled media have repeatedly proclaimed the success of this "Uzbekistan Economic Model"<ref>[http://2004.press-service.uz/rus/knigi/9tom/3tom_12.htm Пресс-служба Президента Республики Узбекистан<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and suggested that it is a unique example of a smooth transition to the market economy while avoiding shock, pauperization and stagnation.

The gradualist reform strategy has involved postponing significant macroeconomic and structural reforms. The state in the hands of the [[new class|bureaucracy]] has remained a dominant influence in the economy. Corruption permeates the society and grows more rampant over time: Uzbekistan's 2005 [[Corruption Perception Index]] was 137 out of 159 countries, whereas in 2007 Uzbekistan is at the very bottom of the ranking, 175 out of 179. A February 2006 report on the country by the [[International Crisis Group]] suggests that revenues earned from key exports, especially cotton, gold, corn and increasingly gas, are distributed among a very small circle of the ruling elite, with little or no benefit for the populace at large.<ref>[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=3952&l=1 International Crisis Group - Uzbekistan: In for the Long Haul<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/New-Report-Paints-Grim-Picture-of-Uzbekistan.cfm New Report Paints Grim Picture of Uzbekistan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], "the government is hostile to allowing the development of an independent private sector, over which it would have no control".<ref>[http://www.eurasiacenter.org/Country%20reports/Central%20Asia/Uzbekistan%20Economic%20Highlights.doc Economist Intelligence Unit report cited]</ref> Thus, the national [[bourgeoisie]] in general, and the [[middle class]] in particular, are marginalized economically and, consequently, politically.

The economic policies have repelled foreign investment, which is the lowest per capita in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].<ref>http://www.state.gov/e/eb/ifd/2005/42196.htm</ref> For years, the largest barrier to foreign companies entering the Uzbekistan market has been the difficulty of converting currency. In 2003, the government accepted the obligations of Article VIII under the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03188.htm Press Release: The Republic of Uzbekistan Accepts Article VIII Obligations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict currency controls and the tightening of borders have lessened the effect of this measure.

Uzbekistan experienced galloping [[inflation]] of around 1000% per year immediately after independence (1992–1994).

Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10%.<ref name=imf/> Tight economic policies in 2004 resulted in a drastic reduction of inflation to 3.8% (although alternative estimates based on the price of a true [[market basket]], put it at 15%).<ref>[http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2005/uzb.asp Asian Development Outlook 2005 - Uzbekistan - ADB.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The inflation rates moved up to 6.9% in 2006 and 7.6% in 2007 but have remained in the single-digit range.<ref>[http://www.indexmundi.com/uzbekistan/inflation_rate_(consumer_prices).html Uzbekistan CPI 2003-2007]</ref>

The government of Uzbekistan restricts foreign imports in many ways, including high import duties. Excise taxes are applied in a highly discriminatory manner to protect locally produced goods. Official tariffs are combined with unofficial, discriminatory charges resulting in total charges amounting to as much as 100 to 150% of the actual value of the product, making imported products virtually unaffordable.<ref>[http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Reports_Publications/2004/2004_National_Trade_Estimate/2004_NTE_Report/asset_upload_file327_4803.pdf NTE 2004 FINAL 3.30.04 latest.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Import substitution is an officially declared policy and the government proudly reports a reduction by a factor of two in the volume of consumer goods imported.<ref>[http://www.mfa.uz/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=59&page=1 Министерство иностранных дел Республики Узбекистан<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A number of CIS countries are officially exempt from Uzbekistan import duties.

The Republican Stock Exchange (RSE) 'Tashkent' opened in 1994. It houses a securities exchange, real estate traders, the national investment fund and the national securities depositary. It does not trade all joint-stock companies each month, and therefore market capitalisation varies widely.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Uzbekistan's external position has been strong since 2003. Thanks in part to the recovery of world market prices of gold and cotton (the country's key export commodities), expanded natural gas and some manufacturing exports, and increasing labour migrant transfers, the current account turned into a large surplus (between 9% and 11% of GDP from 2003 to 2005) and foreign exchange reserves, including gold, more than doubled to around US$3 billion.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Islam is by far the dominant [[religion]] in Uzbekistan. In the early 1990s, many of the [[Russians]] remaining in the [[republic]] (about 8% of the population) were [[Orthodox Christians]]. An estimated 93,000 [[Jews]] also were present. 

Despite its predominance, the practice of [[Islam]] is far from monolithic. Many versions of the faith have been practiced in Uzbekistan. The conflict of Islamic tradition with various agendas of [[Reform movement|reform]] or [[secularization]] throughout the 20th century has left the outside world with a confused notion of Islamic practices in [[Central Asia]]. 

In Uzbekistan the end of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] power did not bring an upsurge of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], as many had predicted, but rather a gradual reacquaintance with the precepts of the faith. However after 2000, there seems to be a rise of support in favour of the [[Islamism|Islamists]].

The [[Uzbek language]] is the only official state language.<ref>[http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/Constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan]</ref> The [[Tajik language]] is widespread in the cities of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarqand]] because of their relatively large population of ethnic [[Tajik people|Tajiks]].<ref name="Foltz"/> 

[[Russian language|Russian]] is still an important language for interethnic communication, especially in the cities, including much day-to-day technical, scientific, governmental and business use. Russian is the main language of over 14% of the population and is spoken as a second language by many more.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}  The use of Russian in remote rural areas has always been limited, and today school children have no proficiency in Russian even in urban centers.  However, it was reported in 2003 that over half of the population could speak Russian, and a renewed close political relationship between Russia and Uzbekistan have meant that official discouragement of Russian has dropped off sharply.<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav091906.shtml "Uzbekistan's Russian-Language Conundrum"]</ref>

In 1992 Uzbekistan officially shifted back to Latin script{{Fact|date=August 2008}}, but many signs and notices (including official government boards in the streets) are still written in Uzbek Cyrillic script that had been used in [[Uzbek SSR]] since 1940. Computers as a rule operate using the "Uzbek Cyrillic" keyboard, and Latin script is reportedly composed using the standard English keyboard.

[[Image:Samarkand-01.JPG|right|thumb|Central Station of Tashkent]]
[[Tashkent]], the nation's capital and largest city, has a three-line [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]] built in 1977, and expanded in 2001 after ten years' independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. Uzbekistan is currently the only country in Central Asia with a subway system, which is [http://www.tashkent.org/uzland/subway.html promoted] as one of the cleanest systems in the former Soviet Union. The stations are exceedingly ornate. For example, the station ''Metro Kosmonavtov'' built in 1984 is decorated using a [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] theme to recognise the achievements of mankind in space exploration and to commemorate the role of [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]], the Soviet [[cosmonaut]] of Uzbek origin. A statue of Vladimir Dzhanibekov stands near one of the station's entrances. 

There are government-operated trams, buses and [[trolley bus]]es running across the city. There are also many taxis, both registered and unregistered. Uzbekistan has car-producing plants which produce modern cars. The car production is supported by the government and the Korean auto company [[Daewoo]]. The Uzbek government acquired a 50% stake in Daewoo in 2005 for an undisclosed sum, and in May 2007 [[UzDaewooAuto]], the car maker, signed a strategic agreement with General Motors-Daewoo Auto and Technology ([[GM Daewoo|GMDAT]]).<ref>[http://www.uzdaily.com/?c=118&a=1315 Uzbekistan, General Motors sign strategic deal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The government also bought a stake in Turkey's Koc in SamKocAuto, a producer of small buses and lorries. Afterwards, it signed an agreement with Isuzu Motors of Japan to produce Isuzu buses and lorries.<ref>[http://www.uzdaily.com/?c=118&a=1242 SamAuto supplies 100 buses to Samarkand firms], UZDaily.com.

Train links connect many towns within Uzbekistan, as well as neighboring former republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. Moreover, after independence two fast-running train systems were established. There is also a large airplane plant that was built during the Soviet era – Tashkent Chkalov Aviation Manufacturing Plant or ТАПОиЧ in Russian. The plant originated during World War II, when production facilities were evacuated south and east to avoid capture by advancing Nazi forces. Until the late 1980s, the plant was one of the leading airplane production centers in the USSR, but with collapse of the Soviet Union its manufacturing equipment became outdated, and most of the workers were laid off. Now it produces only a few planes a year, but with interest from Russian companies growing in it, there are rumors of production-enhancement plans.

{{Main|Military of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Ukbekistani troops.jpg|thumb|left|Uzbek troop during a cooperative operation exercise]]
Uzbekistan possesses the largest military force in the Central Asian region, having around 65,000 people in uniform. Its structure is inherited from the Soviet armed forces, although it is moving rapidly toward a fully restructured organization, which will eventually be built around light and Special Forces. The Uzbekistan Armed Forces equipment is not modern, and training, while improving, is neither uniform nor adequate for its new mission of territorial security. 

The government has accepted the arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union, acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (as a non-nuclear state), and supported an active program by the U.S. [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA) in western Uzbekistan ([[Nukus]] and [[Vozrozhdeniye Island]]). The Government of Uzbekistan spends about 3.7% of GDP on the military but has received a growing infusion of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and other security assistance funds since 1998. 

Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., Uzbekistan approved the U.S. Central Command's request for access to a vital military air base, [[Karshi-Khanabad|Karshi-Khanabad Airbase]], in southern Uzbekistan. However Uzbekistan demanded that the U.S. withdraw from the airbases after the [[Andijan massacre]] and the U.S. reaction to this massacre. The last US troops left Uzbekistan in November 2005.

[[File:Clarence Moore House.JPG|thumb|[[Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Uzbekistan]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Uzbekistan joined the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in December 1991. However, it is opposed to reintegration and withdrew from the CIS collective security arrangement in 1999. Since that time, Uzbekistan has participated in the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and in UN-organized groups to help resolve the Tajikistan and Afghanistan conflicts, both of which it sees as posing threats to its own stability.

Previously close to Washington (which gave Uzbekistan half a billion dollars in aid in 2004, about a quarter of its military budget), the government of Uzbekistan has recently restricted American military use of the airbase at [[Karshi-Khanabad]] for air operations in neighboring Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/intervention/2005/1017ricevisits.htm Rice Attempts to Secure US Influence in Central Asia], Global Policy Forum.</ref> Uzbekistan was an active supporter of U.S. efforts against worldwide terrorism and joined the coalitions that have dealt with both Afghanistan and Iraq. 

The relationship between Uzbekistan and the United States began to deteriorate after the so-called "[[color revolutions]]" in Georgia and Ukraine (and to a lesser extent Kyrgyzstan). When the U.S. joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody events at [[Andijan massacre|Andijon]], the relationship took an additional nosedive, and President Islam Karimov changed the political alignment of the country to bring it closer to Russia and China, countries which chose not to criticize Uzbekistan's leaders for their alleged human rights violations.

In late July 2005, the government of Uzbekistan ordered the United States to vacate an air base in Karshi-Kanabad (near Uzbekistan's border with Afghanistan) within 180 days. Karimov had offered use of the base to the U.S. shortly after [[9/11]]. It is also believed by some Uzbeks that the protests in Andijan were brought about by the U.K. and U.S. influences in the area of Andijan. This is another reason for the hostility between Uzbekistan and the West.

Uzbekistan is a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) (since 2 March 1992), the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC), [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP), and the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). It belongs to the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO) (comprising the five Central Asian countries, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]]). In 1999, Uzbekistan joined the [[GUAM]] alliance ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Moldova]]), which was formed in 1997 (making it GUUAM), but pulled out of the organization in 2005. 

Uzbekistan is also a member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO) and hosts the SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in Tashkent. Uzbekistan joined the new [[Central Asian Cooperation Organization]] (CACO) in 2002. The CACO consists of Uzbekistan, [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. It is a founding member of, and remains involved in, the [[Central Asian Union]], formed with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and joined in March 1998 by Tajikistan.

In September 2006, [[UNESCO]] presented Islam Karimov an award for Uzbekistan's preservation of its rich culture and traditions. Despite criticism, this seems to be a sign of improving relationships between Uzbekistan and the West.

The month of October 2006 also saw a decrease in the isolation of Uzbekistan from the West. The [[EU]] announced that it was planning to send a delegation to Uzbekistan to talk about human rights and liberties, after a long period of hostile relations between the two. Although it is equivocal about whether the official or unofficial version of the [[Andijan Massacre]] is true, the EU is evidently willing to ease its economic sanctions against Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed among Uzbekistan's population that the government will stand firm in maintaining its close ties with the [[Russian Federation]] and in its theory that the 2004–2005 protests in Uzbekistan were promoted by the [[United States|USA]] and [[UK]].

It is said, however, that the number of non-Uzbek people living in Uzbekistan is decreasing as Russians and other minority groups slowly leave and Uzbeks return from other parts of the former [[Soviet Union]].

When Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991, there was concern that [[Muslim fundamentalism]] would spread across the region. The expectation was that a country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of its dominant faith. As of 1994, well over half of Uzbekistan's population was said to be Muslim, though in an official survey few of that number had any real knowledge of the religion or knew how to practice it. However, Islamic observance is increasing in the region.

Uzbekistan has a high [[literacy rate]], with about 99.3% of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write. However with only 88% of the under-15 population currently enrolled in education, this figure may drop in the future {{Fact|date=September 2007}}. Uzbekistan has encountered severe budgeting shortfalls in its education program. The education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform, but the physical base has deteriorated and curriculum revision has been slow.

Uzbekistan's universities create almost 600,000 graduates annually.

Uzbekistan is home to former racing cyclist [[Djamolidine Abdoujaparov]]. Abdoujaparov has won the points contest in the [[Tour de France]] three times, each time winning the coveted yellow jersey. The green jersey is second only to the yellow jersey. Abdoujaparov was a specialist at winning stages in tours or one-day races when the bunch or [[peloton]] would finish together. He would often 'sprint' in the final kilometre and had a reputation as being dangerous in these bunch sprints as he would weave from side to side in a sprint. This reputation earned him the nickname 'The Terror of Tashkent'.

Much of the water was and still continues to be used for the irrigation of cotton fields - a crop that requires an extremely large amount of water to grow.<ref>[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page146.html Aral Sea Crisis] Environmental Justice Foundation Report</ref>  The numbers of animal deaths and human refugees from the area around the sea can only be guessed at. The question of who is responsible for the crisis – the Soviet scientists and politicians who directed the distribution of water during the 1960s, or the post-Soviet politicians who did not allocate sufficient funding for the building of dams and irrigation systems – remains open.

Due to the virtually insoluble Aral Sea problem, high [[salinity]] and contamination of the soil with [[heavy elements]] are especially widespread in [[Karakalpakstan]] – the region of Uzbekistan adjacent to the Aral Sea.
