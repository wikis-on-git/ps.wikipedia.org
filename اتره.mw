In the upper chest, the [[heart]] and [[lungs]] are protected by the [[Human rib cage|rib cage]], and the abdomen contains the majority of organs responsible for [[digestion]]: the  [[liver]], which respectively produces [[bile]] necessary for digestion; the [[large intestine|large]] and [[small intestine]]s, which extract nutrients from food; the [[anus]], from which [[human feces|fecal wastes]] are excreted; the [[rectum]], which stores [[feces]]; the [[gallbladder]], which stores and concentrates bile and produces [[chyme]]; the [[ureter]]s, which passes [[urine]] to the bladder; the [[urinary bladder|bladder]], which stores urine; and the [[urethra]], which excretes urine and passes [[sperm]] through the [[seminal vesicle]]s. Finally, the [[pelvic]] region houses both the male and female [[sex organs|reproductive organs]].
