'''Ayub Khan''' ([[1857]] ([[Kabul]]) - [[April 7]] [[1914]] ([[Lahore]]) was also known as '''The Victor of [[Battle of Maiwand|Maiwand]]''' or '''The Afghan [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charlie]]''' and was, for a while, the governor of [[Herat]]. His father was [[Sher Ali Khan]] and his mother was the daughter of an influential [[Mohmand]] chief of Lalpura, Saadat Khan. On [[July 27]] [[1880]] he defeated General Burrows at the [[Battle of Maiwand]] and went on to besiege the British at [[Kandahar]]. On [[September 1]] [[1880]] he was defeated and routed by [[General]] [[Frederick Roberts]] at the [[Battle of Kandahar]], which saw the end of the [[European influence in Afghanistan#The Second Anglo-Afghan War|Second Afghan War]]. A year later Ayub tried again to take Kandahar, this time from [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the Amir, but again failed. In [[1888]] Ayub Khan left [[Persian Empire|Persia]] (now [[Iran]]), where he had escaped to, and became a [[pensioner]] in [[British India]] until his death in [[1914]]. His body was interred near the [[shrine]] of Sheikh Habib at Durrani graveyard [[Peshawar]].
