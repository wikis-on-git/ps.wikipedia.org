He claimed to fulfill the [[Bábism|Bábí]] prophecy of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", but in a broader sense he also claimed to be the "supreme Manifestation of God".<ref>{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh|year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id = ISBN 0-87743-187-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-78.html#pg151 |pages= pp. 151 }}</ref>, referring to the fulfillment of the [[eschatology|eschatological]] expectations of a [[progressive revelation|prophetic cycle]] beginning with [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], and including [[Abrahamic religion]]s, as well as [[Zoroastrianism]], the [[Indian religions]], and others. Bahá'ís see Bahá'u'lláh as the initiator of a new religion, as [[Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]] — but also the initiator of a new cycle, like that attributed to Adam.

Bahá'u'lláh authored many religious works, most notably the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' and the ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]''. He died in [[Mansion of Bahjí|Bahjí]], [[Palestine]], present-day [[Israel]], and is buried there.

Bahá'u'lláh was born on [[November 12]], [[1817]], in [[Tehran]], the capital city of [[Persia]], in present-day Iran. His mother was Khadíjih Khánum and his father was [[Mírzá `Abbás Núrí|Mírzá Buzurg]].  Bahá'u'lláh's father, Mírzá Buzurg, served as [[vizier]] to Imám-Virdi Mírzá, the twelfth son of [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar]]. Mírzá Buzurg was later appointed governor of [[Borujerd|Burujird]] and [[Lorestan]],<ref name = "Balyuzi" >{{cite book |first=Hasan |last=Balyuzi |year=2000 |title=Bahá'u'lláh, King of Glory }}</ref> a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when [[Mohammad Shah Qajar|Muhammad Shah]] came to power.

In 1844, a 25 year-old man from [[Shiraz]], Siyyid Mírzá `Alí-Muhammad, who took the title of [[Báb|the Báb]] (Arabic; meaning "The Gate"), claimed to be the promised [[Mahdi]] of Islam.<ref name="iranica_bab">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bāb, Sayyed `Ali Mohammad Sirazi | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}</ref> The movement quickly spread across the [[Persian Empire]] and received widespread opposition from the Islamic clergy.<ref name="iranica_bab" /> The Báb himself was executed in 1850 by firing squad at the age of 30 and the community was almost entirely exterminated in 1852-3.<ref name="iranica_bab" />

=== د باب منل ===
At the age of 28, Bahá'u'lláh received a messenger, [[Mullá Husayn]], telling him of the [[Báb]], whose message he accepted, becoming a Bábí. Bahá'u'lláh began to spread the new cause, especially in his native province of Núr, becoming recognized as one of its most influential believers.<ref name = "Balyuzi" /><ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his teaching trips were met with success, even among some of the religious class.  He also helped to protect his co-religionists, such as [[Tahirih]], but did so at some risk, since the aid he was giving led to his being temporarily imprisoned in [[Tehran]] and enduring [[bastinado]].<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> Bahá'u'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of [[Khorasan]], where 81 prominent Babis met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Babis who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispenation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bahá'u'lláh took on the name Baha.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> 

When violence started between the Babis and the Qajar government in the later part of 1848, Bahá'u'lláh tried to reach the besieged Babis at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi|Shaykh Tabarsi]] in [[Mazandaran]], but was arrested and imprisoned before he could get there.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> The following years until 1850 saw the Babis being massacred in various provinces after the Báb made his claim of being [[Manifestation of God]] more public.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> 

=== سياه چال ===
In 1852, two years after the execution of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh met briefly with a couple radical Babi leaders and learnt of an assassination plan against the Shah, [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]], in retaliation for the Báb's execution.  Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan, but on [[August 15]], [[1852]] Babis attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed. Many of the Bábís who were not killed, including Bahá'u'lláh, were imprisoned in the [[Síyáh-Chál]] (Black Pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran.<ref name="eor">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed.

According to Bahá'u'lláh, it was during his imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a Maiden from God, through whom he received his mission as a Messenger of God and as the One whose coming the Báb had prophesied.<ref name="eor" /><ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /> After four months in the Síyáh-Chál, owing to the insistent demands of the Ambassador of Russia <ref>[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/P-T/S/sohrab/LP25.gif]</ref>, and after the person who tried to kill the Shah confessed and exonerated the Bábi leaders, the authorities released him from prison, but the government exiled him from Iran.  Bahá'u'lláh chose to go to Iraq in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and arrived in [[Baghdad]] in early 1853.<ref name="iranica_bahaullah" />

[[دوتنه:Bahaullah-passport.jpg|thumb|right|Bahá'u'lláh's passport, dated January 1853]]
In [[1853]], with limited supplies and food, and through the cold of winter, Bahá'u'lláh and his family travelled from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] to [[Baghdad]].

[[Subh-i-Azal|Mírzá Yaḥyá]] had been appointed by the [[Báb]] to lead the Bábí community, and had been travelling around Persia in disguise. He decided to go to Baghdad and join the group using funds given to him by Bahá'u'lláh.

An increasing number of Bábí's considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of [[pilgrim]]s started coming there from Persia. However, as time went on, people began to look to Mírzá Yaḥyá for leadership less and less, and instead saw Bahá'u'lláh as their leader.<ref name="deepen">{{cite journal | first = Bijan | last = Ma'sumian | title = Baha'u'llah's Seclusion in Kurdistan |volume = 1 | number = 1 | pages = pp. 18-26 | journal = Deepen Magazine| date = 1993 Fall | url = http://bahai-library.com/?file=masumian_bahaullah_kurdistan}}</ref>

Mírzá Yaḥyá, as the appointed leader of the Bábís, started to try to discredit Bahá'u'lláh and further divided the community.<ref name="deepen" /> The actions of Mírzá Yaḥyá drove many people away from the religion and allowed its enemies to continue their persecution.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> 

=== کردستان ===
On [[April 10]] [[1854]] Bahá'u'lláh, without telling anyone his purpose or destination, left with one companion to the mountains of [[Kurdistan]], north-east of Baghdad, near the city [[Sulaymaniyah]].<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> He later wrote that he left so as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Bábí community.

For two years Bahá'u'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan<ref name="eor" /> dressed like a [[dervish]] and using the name ''Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani''. At one point someone noticed his remarkable penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, undisputed leaders of the [[Naqshbandi|Naqshbandíyyih]], [[Qadiriyyah|Qádiríyyih]], and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice and admire him. It was to the second of these that the [[Four Valleys (Bahá'í)|Four Valleys]] was written. Several other notable books were also written during this time.<ref name="eor" />

In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray.<ref name="cole_bahabio" /> Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, thus searched for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a wise man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighbouring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family pleaded with him to come back to Baghdad, which he did.<ref name="cole_bahabio" />

=== بغداد ته راستنېدنه ===
When Bahá'u'lláh returned to Baghdad he saw that the Bábí community had become disheartened and divided. In the time of Bahá'u'lláh's absence, the Baghdad community had become alienated with the religion since Mirza Yahya had proceeded to marry the widowed wife of the Báb against the clear instructions left by him <ref name="cole_bahabio" /> and dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the [[Shah]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | title = The Bábí & Bahá'í Religions: From Messianic Shí'ism to a World Religion | location = Cambridge | publisher = The University Press | year = 1987 | pages = pp. 60 | id =ISBN 0-521-30128-9}}</ref>  A few Babis went so far as refuting Mirza Yahya's claims to successorship, advancing counter-claims, and disseminating their own writings.<ref name="rob1">{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |id= ISBN 0-85398-270-8}}</ref>

Bahá'u'lláh remained in Baghdád for seven more years. During this time, while keeping his perceived station as the [[Manifestation of God]] hidden, he taught the Báb's teachings.  He published many books and verses, which he called [[revelation]]s, including the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Book of Certitude]] and the [[Hidden Words]]. 

Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community gained the attention of his enemies in [[Islamic]] clergy and the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian government]]. <ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannica | location = Chicago | id = ISBN 0-85229-486-7}}</ref>  They were eventually successful in having the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] exile Bahá'u'lláh from Baghdad to [[Constantinople]].<ref name="britannica" />

[[دوتنه:Map iran ottoman empire banishment.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Bahá'u'lláh's banishments]]
On [[April 22]] [[1863]], Bahá'u'lláh left Baghdad and entered the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]] near Baghdad. Bahá'u'lláh and those accompanying him would stay in the garden for twelve days before departing for Constantinople. It was during his time in the Garden of Ridván that Bahá'u'lláh declared to his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God.<ref name="eor "/> Today Bahá'ís celebrate the twelve days that Bahá'u'lláh was in the Garden of Ridván as the festival of [[Ridván]].

The eleven years of messianic secrecy that passed between when Bahá'u'lláh claimed to have seen the Maiden of Heaven in the Síyáh-Chál and this declaration are referred to by Bahá'í chroniclers and by Bahá'u'lláh himself as ''ayyam-i butun'' ("Days of Concealment").  Bahá'u'lláh stated that this period was a "set time of concealment".

As mentioned previously, Bahá'u'lláh was given an order to relocate to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital of [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]). Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from [[Baghdad]] was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually the penal colony of Akká, Palestine (now [[Acre, Israel]]).

Bahá'u'lláh and [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|his family]], along with a small group of [[Bábí]]s, stayed in Constantinople for only four months. (One source <ref>[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/P-T/S/sohrab/LP27.gif]</ref> states there were seventy-five people all together.) During this time the Persian Ambassador in the court of the [[Sultan]] mounted a systematic campaign against Bahá'u'lláh. He was thus exiled to Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]), but before leaving he wrote a [[Tablet (religious)|Tablet]] to the Sultan, the contents of which are unknown, but Shamsi Big, who delivered the letter, gave the following report:
:“I know not what that letter contained, for no sooner had the Grand Vizir perused it than he turned the color of a corpse, and remarked: ‘It is as if the King of Kings were issuing his behest to his humblest vassal king and regulating his conduct.’”<ref>Quoted in {{cite book| first=Shoghi | last=Effendi | authorlink=Shoghi Effendi | year=1944 | title=God Passes By | url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-10.html#pg160 | pages= p. 160}}</ref>

=== Adrianople (Edirne) ===
[[دوتنه:Early Bahais-1.jpg|thumb|left|320px|`Abdu'l-Bahá in Adrianople with his brothers and companions of Bahá'u'lláh.]]
During the month of December [[1863]], Bahá'u'lláh and [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|his family]] embarked on a twelve-day journey to [[Edirne|Adrianople]].  Bahá'u'lláh stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years.  Mirza Yahya, upon hearing Bahá'u'lláh's words in a [[Tablet (religious)|Tablet]] read to him, challenging him to accept Bahá'u'lláh's Revelation, offered a counter-claim that he was the one whom the Báb had prophesied about.  This caused a break within the Bábí community, and the followers of Bahá'u'lláh became known as [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], while the followers of Mirza Yahya, also known as Subh-i-Azal ("Morning of Eternity") became known as [[Azalís]]. See [[Bahá'í/Bábí split]]. While in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh was poisoned and nearly died. His hand was left shaking for the rest of his life. Bahá'í historical texts, and contemporary accounts, report that Subh-i-Azal was directly behind the poisoning. <ref>{{cite book| last=Mírzá Muhammad Jawád of Qazvín| year=1904| title=An epitome of Bábí and Bahá'í history to A.D. 1898| url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web | title = Baha'u'llah's Surah of God: Text, Translation, Commentary| last = Cole | first = Juan R.I. | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/vol6/surall.htm}}</ref> Later, followers of Azal made the counter-claim that Bahá'u'lláh had accidentally poisoned himself while trying to poison others. <ref> Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani made this claim later in his ''[[Hasht-Bihisht]]''.

Also, while in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed the [[Bahá'í Faith]] further by addressing [[Tablet (religious)|Tablets]] to the kings and rulers of the world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavor towards the betterment of the world and its peoples. Some of these leaders include: 

* Pope [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]]
* Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]]
* Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]]
* King [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] of Prussia
* [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] of Great Britain and Ireland
* Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] of Austria-Hungary
* Sultan [[`Abdu'l-`Aziz|‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz]] of the Ottoman Empire
* [[Nasser al-Din Shah|Násiri’d-Dín Sháh]] of the Persian Empire
* Rulers of [[Americas|America]] and the Presidents of the Republics therein

[[دوتنه:Prison-cell-bahaullah.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prison Cell of Bahá'u'lláh, Akká]]

The disagreements between the Bahá'ís and the Azalís allowed the Ottoman and Persian authorities to exile Bahá'u'lláh once again.  One morning, without any notice, soldiers surrounded Bahá'u'lláh's house and told everyone to get ready to depart to the prison-city of `Akká, Palestine.  Bahá'u'lláh and his family left Adrianople on [[August 12]] [[1868]] and after a journey by land and sea arrived in [[Akko|`Akká]] on [[August 31]].  The inhabitants of `Akká were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden.

The first years in `Akká imposed very harsh conditions on, and held very trying times for, Bahá'u'lláh. [[Mirzá Mihdí]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and [[meditation]]. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bahá'u'lláh, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after Sultan [[`Abdu'l-`Aziz]]'s death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From [[1877]] until [[1879]] Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of [[Mazra'ih#Mazra.27ih|Mazra'ih]].

[[دوتنه:Shrine of Baha'u'llah above.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The shrine where Bahá'u'lláh is buried, from above.]]
The final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life ([[1879]]-[[1892]]) were spent in the [[Mansion of Bahjí]], just outside `Akká, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in `Akká and Bahjí, Bahá'u'lláh produced many volumes of work including the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]. 

In [[1890]] the [[Cambridge]] orientalist [[Edward Granville Browne]] had an interview with Bahá'u'lláh in this house. After this meeting he wrote his famous pen-portrait of Bahá'u'lláh:

:"In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the kind called táj by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!"<ref>Introduction by [[E.G.

On [[May 9]] [[1892]] Bahá'u'lláh contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on [[May 29]] [[1892]]. He was buried in a [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh|Shrine]] located next to the Mansion of Bahjí.

When Bahá'u'lláh died, he left a [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will and Testament]], which stated the following in regard to succession:
:"The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan and My Kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch... Verily God hath ordained the station of the Greater Branch [Muhammad ‘Alí] to be beneath that of the Most Great Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Wise.

The favor given to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] was a cause of jealousy within [[Bahá'u'lláh's family]]. Muhammad `Alí insisted that he should be the one to lead the Bahá'í community. This period is considered by Bahá'ís as one of the most difficult tests of the early years of the Faith. 

Due to the conflict with his half brother, `Abdu'l-Bahá ex-communicated him as a [[Covenant-breaker]]. The division was not long lived. After being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in [[1937]] with only a handful of followers.

Bahá'u'lláh wrote many books, [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] and prayers, of which only a fraction has been translated into English until now. He revealed thousands of tablets with a total volume more than 70 times the size of the Qur'an and more than 15 times the size of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. <ref>{{cite web | title = A new volume of Bahá'í sacred writings, recently translated and comprising Bahá'u'lláh's call to world leaders, is published| last = BWNS| accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story.cfm?storyid=163}}</ref>,<ref>{{cite web | title = Bahá'í Archives - Preserving and safeguarding the Sacred Texts| last = Archives Office at the Bahá'í World Centre, Haifa, Israel| accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/arjen.nandita2/bahai-archives.htm}}</ref>,<ref>{{cite web | title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts| last = Universal House of Justice| accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_numbers_sacred_writings}}</ref> Below are some that have been translated to [[English language|English]]:

[[دوتنه:Bahaullah from miller.jpg|thumb|250px|Bahá'u'lláh. Persian inscription reads ''Mírzá Ḥusayn-`Alí' Nuri'']]
There are two known photographs of Bahá'u'lláh.  This photo was taken while he was in [[Adrianople]] (reproduced in [[William McElwee Miller|William Miller]]'s book on the Bahá'í Faith).  Copies of both pictures are at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]], and one is on display in the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#International Archives|International Archives]] building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized [[pilgrimage]].  Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer to not view this photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes,[http://bahai-library.com/uhj/photo.bahaullah.html] and Bahá'í institutions have requested the press not to publish the image in the media.[http://www.bahai.us/system/files/PublicationofPhotos.pdf ]

Bahá'u'lláh's image is not, itself, offensive to Bahá'ís.  However, Bahá'ís are expected to treat the image of any [[Manifestation of God]] with extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions  [[Depiction of Jesus|of Jesus]] or [[depictions of Muhammad|of Muhammad]], and refrain from portraying any of them in [[play]]s and [[drama]]. For example, copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's writing of the ''[[Suriy-i-Mulúk]]'' (Tablet to the Kings), which [[Shoghi Effendi]] describes as "the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh" (''God Passes By'', pp. 171).  After a meeting in Edirne (Adrianople), Turkey, the [[Hands of the Cause]] travelled to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view.' (Marks, Geoffry W. (Ed.) (1986). ''Messages of The Universal House of Justice 1963 to 1986'', p. 105.)  

The official Bahá'í position on displaying the photograph of Bahá'u'lláh is:

:"There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bahá'u'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, December 6, 1939)
::(Compilations, ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 540)

While the above passage clarifies that it is considered disrespectful to display his photograph to the public, regarding postings on other websites the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] has written:

:"For Bahá'ís, the photograph of Bahá'u'lláh is very precious and it should not only be viewed but also handled with due reverence and respect, which is not the case here. Thus, it is indeed disturbing to Bahá'ís to have the image of Bahá'u'lláh treated in such a disrespectful way. However, as the creator of the site is not a Bahá'í, there is little, if anything, that can be done to address this matter. We hope these comments have been of assistance."
