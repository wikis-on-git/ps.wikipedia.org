== '''زوكړه''' ==
'''Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Miskawayh''', (Persian: ابن مسكوويه) also known as '''Ibn Miskawayh''' ([[932]]-[[1030]]) was a prominent [[Iran|Persian]] [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Islamic science|scientist]], [[Islamic poetry|poet]] and [[Historiography of early Islam|historian]] from [[Ray, Iran]]. He was active politically during the [[Buwayhid]] era.

His [[Al-Fawz al-Asghar]] manuscript is believed to have greatly influenced [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[On the Origin of Species]].
His effect on Islamic philosophy is mainly concerned with ethical issues. He was the author of the first major [[Islamic]] work on [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], entitled ''Tadhib al-akhlaq'' (Ethical Instruction), focusing on practical ethics, conduct, and refinement of character. He separated personal ethics from the public realm, and contrasted the liberating nature of reason with the deception and temptation of nature. 

==Evolution==
Ibn Miskawayh was one of the first to clearly describe the idea of [[evolution]]. [[Muhammad Hamidullah]] describes the evolutionary ideas found in Ibn Miskawayh's ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' as follows:

{{quote|"[These books] state that [[God]] first created [[matter]] and invested it with [[energy]] for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of [[vapour]] which assumed the shape of [[water]] in due time. The next stage of development was [[mineral]] life. Different kinds of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s developed in course of time. Their highest form being mirjan ([[coral]]). It is a stone which has in it branches like those of a [[tree]]. After mineral life evolves [[vegetation]]. The evolution of vegetation culminates with a [[tree]] which bears the qualities of an animal. This is the [[Date Palm|date-palm]]. It has [[male]] and [[female]] genders. It does not wither if all its branches are chopped but it dies when the head is cut off. The date-palm is therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among animals. Then is born the lowest of animals. It evolves into an [[ape]]. This is not the statement of Darwin. This is what Ibn Maskawayh states and this is precisely what is written in the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity|Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa]]''. The Muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into a lower kind of a [[barbarian]] [[man]]. He then became a superior [[human]] being. Man becomes a [[saint]], a [[prophet]]. He evolves into a higher stage and becomes an [[angel]]. The one higher to angels is indeed none but God. Everything begins from Him and everything returns to Him."<ref name=Hamidullah>[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] and Afzal Iqbal (1993), ''The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity'', p. 143-144. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad.</ref>}}

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[manuscript]]s of the ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' were available in [[Europe]]an universities by the 19th century. This work is believed to have been studied by [[Charles Darwin]], who was a student of Arabic, and it is thought to have had an influence on his inception of [[Darwinism]].<ref name=Hamidullah/>
