د 1903 زېږدي کال په دسمبر کې د امريکا په اوهايو ايالت کې دوو وروڼود دټولو مخکنيواړينو تياريو وروسته د خپل پنځولي ماشين د الوزولو لپاره د 1903 زېږدي کال د دسمبرمياشتې 14 مه نېټه وټاکله, خو له بده مرغه د دوى د الوتنې لومړنۍ هڅه بريالۍ نه شوه , بالاخره يې له دې هڅې درې ورځې وروسته يعنې د دسمبرپه 17 مه نېټه خپله يو ماشينه جوړه کړې الوتکې ته په هوا کې څلور ځلې چکر ورکړ او د تل لپاره يې د انسان ډوله الوتونکو د لړ په سرکې ځاى ونيو, دوى له دې وروسته خپلې الوتکې ته افقي سکان ياهغه اله د الوتکې په مخه کې وراضافه کړه چې له شاه څخه مخې ته يا يې برعکس توله ساتي, يوکال وروسته يې يو بل عمودي سکان د الوتکې په شاه کې ځاى پرځاى کړ چې په مرسته يې وکړاى شي الوتکه يو او بل لوري ته متمايله کړي او هم په يو لازم جګوالي کې الوتنه او پرواز وکړي, په دې سربېره دوى بريالي شول چې له دريو اصلي خواوو (اوږدوالي, سور او جګوالي) د الوتکې يو ډول والى يا موازنه وساتي, او نورې کنترولېدونکې الې يې هم د الوتکې په اره بڼه کې ځاى په ځاى کړي. 

د الوتکې د چټکتيا او تېز تگ لپاره يې يو ګازويلي څلور سلنډره ماشين څخه چې 12 اس ځواکه طاقت يې درلود استفاده وکړه, او د وزن دکمولو لپاره يې د الوتکې په توکو کې له المونيم څخه کار واخيست 

د رايټ وروڼو د خپلې ازمويني الوتنې لپاره په شمالي کارولينا کې د Outer Banks سيمه وټاکله, دا داسې سيمه وه, چې د اوسپنې له پټليو او سړکونو څخه لرې وه او دسمندري بېړيو له تم ځايونو څخه يې ډېر ښه مناسب واټن درلود. 

د دوى دوه وزرې الوتکې, په لومړنۍ ازموينه کې چې ويلبر رايټ چلوله, د 120 فټه واټن په 12 ثانيو کې طى کړ, او په اخرنۍ او اوږده الوتنه کې چې بياهم ويلبر رايټ چلووله, ددوى الوتکې 852 فټه واټن په 59 ثانيو کې وواهه. 

په نړۍ کې د الوتکې دا لومړنى پيلوټ ځوانيمرګ شو او په 1912 زېږدي کال د مى په دېرشمه ومړ. 

ورور يې (ارويل) د 1948 زېږدي کال د جنوري په دېرشمه د 72 کلنۍ په منګ مړ شو. 

== د بشر په لاس د جوړو شويو الوتونکو وسيلو وېشنه ==
 
په لومړي سر کې د بشر په لاس جوړ شوي الوتونکي وسايل په دوو ټوليزو ډلو وېشل شوي دي. 

1: الوتکې (vliegtuig) هغه وسايل چې په هوا کې الوزي. 

2: تشيالي بېړۍ (فضايي الوتکې) (space craft) هغه وسايل چې په فضا کې الوزي. 



د الوتکو په بېلابېلو اړخونو به وغږېږو خو په لومړي سر کې د چټکتيا په نظر کې نيولو سره الوتکې په څلورو ډولو وېشل شوې دي. 



1: د غږ له چټکتياڅخه په په منډه کې کمزورې (کمې) (subsonische vliegtuigen 0 <M <0.7) 

2: د غږ له چټکتيا سره په منډه کې مساوي الوتکې (Transonic Vliegtuig 1,2 <M <0.7) 

3: له غږ څخه په چټکتيا کې تېزې الوتکې (Supersonic Aircraft1 <M <5) 

4: له غږ څخه په چټکتيا کې ډېرې تېزې الوتکې (Hypersonic Aircraft 5 <M) 

ددې ټولو الوتکو توپير په دې کې دى, چې له غږ (صوت) څخه په چټکتيا کې څومره تېزې دي. مانا داچې صوت په يوه ثانيه کې 267 متره واټن وهي ايا دوى په يوه ثانيه کې له 267 متره څخه کم يا که ډېر واټن طۍ کوي. 

M مساوي کېږي د الوتکې د سرعت نسبت د الوتکې دغږ پر سرعت اوهغه جګوالي چې الوتکه په هغه کې پرواز کوي. 

د وزرونوپه نظر کې نيولو سره د الوتکو ډولونه 

1: ثابت وزر لرونکې الوتکې (vaste vleugel Aircraft) 

2: څرخېدونکي وزر والې الوتکې (Rotary vleugel Air craft) 

لومړني ډول ته يې الوتکه او دويم ډول ته يې چورلکه (هليکوپټر) وايي. الوتکې عموما د ثابتو (نه ښورېدونکو) وزرونو درلودونکې وي, او د الوتنې په مهال يې وزرونه نه څرخي. 

خو چورلکې بيا هغه الوتکې دي چې د الوتنې په وخت کې يې وزرونه په يوه چورلېز (محور) څرخي. 

د سورلۍ يا پيلوټ په نظرکې نيولو سره د الوتکې (د بشر په لاس جوړ شوي هغه شيان چې په هوا کې الوزي) ډولونه. 

د پيلوټ يا ورسره ناستې عملې په نظرکې نيولو سره الوتکې په دوو ټوليزو ډلو وېشل شوې دي. 

1: پيلوټ لرونکې الوتکې (bemande vliegtuigen) 

2: بې پيلوټه الوتکې (onbemande vliegtuigen) 

په بې پيلوټه الوتکو کې لارښوونه کېدونکي توغندي, نه لارښوونه کېدونکي توغندي (Rocket) او هم له لرې څخه کنټرولېدونکې الوتکې (RPV) (op afstand bestuurd voertuig) او نور ... راځي. 






== د وزن په نظر کې نيولو سره د الوتکې ډولونه ==
 



د وزن په نظرکې نيولو سره الوتکې په کلي ډول په دوو ډلو وېشل شوې دي. 

1: هغه الوتکې چې د هوا اړوند ازموينوڅخه درنې وي (zwaarder dan Aircraft) 

2: هغه الوتکې چې د هوا اړوند ازموينو څخه سپکې وي (lichter dan Aircraft) 

په دې دويمه ډله کې يې بالون (ballon), هوايي کښتۍ (Air schip) او همداسې نور راځي. 




== د مانورکوونکو الوتکو ډولونه: ==
 

د مانور د ځواک د لرلو له مخې الوتکې په څلورو بېلابېلو ډلو وېشل شوې دي 

[[غيرمانوري الوتکې (Normal (Niet Aerobatic) Aircraft)]] 

[[نيمه مانوري الوتکې (Utility (semi Aerobatic) Aircraft)]] 

[[مانوري الوتکې: (Aerobatic Aircraft)]] 

[[ډېرمانورې الوتکې: (hoge wendbaarheid Aircraft)]] 



له بلې خوا د وزن, کېناستلو د ډول, د رادار څخه دپټېدلود ځواک د درلودلو (Stealth) په نظرکې نيولو سره الوتکې په بېلابېلو ډولونو وېشل شوې دي.

'''''Airplane!''''' is a 1980 American [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy film]] directed and written by [[David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]], and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It stars [[Robert Hays]] and [[Julie Hagerty]] and features [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], and [[Lorna Patterson]]. The film is a [[Parody|spoof]] of the [[disaster film]] genre, and is, in a sense, a remake of the 1957 Paramount film ''[[Zero Hour!]]''.<ref name="commentary">{{cite video | people=Abrahams, Jim; Zucker, David; Zucker, Jerry; Davidson, Jon|date=2000|title=Airplane! DVD audio commentary| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}</ref> In Australia it is known as '''''Flying High''''' and in New Zealand the film is known as '''''Flying High!'''''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q=Airplane IMDb Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

''Airplane!'' was a huge financial success, grossing over [[United States dollar|US$]]83 million in North America alone, against a budget of just $3.5 million.<ref name="gross"/> The film's creators received the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay#1980s|Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy]], and nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/awards|title=Awards for Airplane!|publisher=IMDB}}</ref>

In the years since its release, ''Airplane!'''s reputation has grown substantially beyond its modest comic intentions. The film was voted the 10th-funniest American comedy on [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s ''[[100 Years... 100 Laughs]]'' list, and ranked 6th on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] ''100 Funniest Movies''. In a major 2007 survey by [[Channel 4]] in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], it was judged the second greatest comedy film of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/newsfeatures/microsites/G/greatest-comedyfilms|title=Channel 4: 50 Greatest Comedy Films}}</ref>

In 2008, ''Airplane!'' was selected by [[Empire Magazine]] as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time''.

==Plot==
Ex-[[fighter pilot]] Ted Striker became traumatized after an incident during the [[WWII|war]], leading to his [[aviophobia|fear of flying]] and his "drinking problem" (implying [[alcoholism]], but specifically the "problem" refers to that he always misses his mouth with any drink and splashes his face). Recovering his courage, Striker attempts to regain the love of his life from the war, Elaine, now a [[stewardess]]. In order to win her love, Striker overcomes his fear and buys a ticket on a flight she is serving on, from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Chicago]]. However, during the flight, Elaine rebuffs his attempts.

After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and fellow passenger Dr. Rumack quickly realizes that one of the meal options gave the passengers [[food poisoning]]. The stewards discover that the pilot crew, including [[pilot]] Clarence Oveur and [[co-pilot]] Roger Murdock, have all come down with food poisoning, leaving no one aboard to fly the plane. Elaine contacts the Chicago [[control tower]] for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey to activate the plane's [[autopilot]], a large blow-up doll named "Otto", which will get them to Chicago but will not be able to land the plane. Elaine realizes that Striker, being the only pilot on board who has not succumbed to food poisoning, is their only chance, and he is convinced to fly the plane, though he still feels his trauma will prevent him from safely landing it.

McCroskey, after hearing Striker's name on the radio, sends for Striker's former commander, Rex Kramer, to help talk him down.  As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers. Striker's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss while Otto takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female autopilot doll.

==Production==
[[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]], and [[David Zucker]] (collectively known as [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|ZAZ]]) wrote ''Airplane!'' while they were performing with the Kentucky Fried Theatre, a successful small theatre they had founded in 1971. The ZAZ came to the idea of spoofing airplane films when they accidentally taped the 1957 film ''[[Zero Hour!]]'', while they were looking for commercials to spoof.<ref name="commentary"/> Abrahams later described ''Zero Hour!'' as "... the serious version of ''Airplane!''". It was the first film script they wrote, and was originally called ''The Late Show''. The original script contained spoofs of television commercials; however, people who proofread the script for them advised them to shorten the commercials, and, eventually, they removed them. When their script was finished they were unable to sell it.<ref name="directors">{{cite book|pages=337–342|title=The Directors: Take One|author=Emery, Robert J.|chaptertitle=The films of Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker|publisher=Allworth Communications, Inc.|date=2002|ISBN=9781581152180}}</ref>

The trio knew director [[John Landis]], who encouraged them to write film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put the film, called ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', in production in the late 1970s, and entered a movie set for the first time; David Zucker explains: "{{interp|...}} It was the first time we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that if you really wanted a movie to come out the way you wanted it to, you had to direct. So on the next movie, ''Airplane!'', we insisted on directing."<ref name="directors"/> 
 
Filming took 34 days,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/trivia IMDB Trivia]</ref> mostly during August 1979. The plane used throughout the film was a [[TWA]] [[Boeing 707]] model; the plane taking off with "The End" credit is not a 707 (which has four engines), but a [[Boeing 727]] tri-jet. The ambient noise of the plane is not that of a jet but a propeller driven plane (possibly piston engines); it was taken from the soundtrack of ''Zero Hour!'', making it the longest running gag in the film.

===Casting===
David Zucker explained that "the trick was to cast actors like [[Robert Stack]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]]. These were people, who up to that time, had never done comedy. We thought they were much funnier than the comedians of that time were." David Zucker felt Stack was the most important actor to be cast, since he was the "linchpin" to the film's plot.<ref name="directors"/> Stack initially played his role differently from what the directors had in mind. They showed him a tape of impressionist [[John Byner]] impersonating Robert Stack. According to the producers, Stack was "doing an impression of John Byner doing an impression of Stack."<ref name="commentary"/> Stack was not initially interested in the part, but was persuaded by ZAZ. Bridges was advised by his children to take the part.<ref name="directors"/>

The film's writers and directors, as well as members of their family, showed up in [[cameo appearance]]s. David and Jerry appear as two ground crew members who accidentally direct a 747 to taxi through a terminal window. Abrahams is one of many religious zealots scattered throughout the film. Charlotte Zucker (David and Jerry's mother) is the woman attempting to apply makeup in the plane as it violently shifts. Their sister Susan Breslau is the second ticket agent at the airport. Jim Abraham's mother is the woman initially sitting next to Dr. Rumack.

Several other cameos add to the humor by casting actors against type. [[Barbara Billingsley]], best known as [[June Cleaver]] from ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', makes an appearance as a woman who announces she "speaks [[African American Vernacular English|jive]]" and can translate for two African-American passengers. [[Maureen McGovern]] appears as Sister Angelina, a spoof of the nun in ''[[Airport 1975]]'', and a poke at her involvement as the singer of the Oscar-winning songs for the disaster films ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). [[Jimmie Walker]] cameos as the man opening the hood of the plane and checking the oil before takeoff; Walker also had a minor role in the air disaster film, ''[[The Concorde: Airport '79]]''. [[Howard Jarvis]], the property tax rebel and author of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|California Proposition 13]], plays the taxi passenger who is left at the curb with the meter running in the film's opening and closing scene. [[Ethel Merman]], in her last film appearance, plays a shell-shocked male soldier who is convinced he is Ethel Merman. Finally, [[NBA]] star [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] plays co-pilot Murdock, who is later revealed in dialogue to actually be Abdul-Jabbar living a secret double life.

===Score===
In 1980, an LP soundtrack for the film was released by Regency Records, and included dialog and songs from the film. It was also narrated by [[Shadoe Stevens]], and only featured one score track, the "Love Theme from ''Airplane''" composed by Elmer Bernstein.

On April 28, 2009, [[La-La Land Records]] announced that they would release the first official score album for ''Airplane!'', containing Bernstein's complete score.<ref>[http://www.lalalandrecords.com/SpecialAnnouncement.html La-La Land Records Announces a Special Mayday Alert!]</ref>

==Release==
Prior to its release, the directors had been apprehensive due to a mediocre response at one of the pre-screenings. However, the film made back its entire budget of about $3.5 million in its first weekend of release. Overall, it earned more than $83 million at the [[box office]] and another $40 million in rentals<ref name="gross"/>, making it the fourth highest grossing film of 1980.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=airplane.htm Airplane!

In the same year, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' voted it the second greatest comedy film of all time. It also came second in the British [[50 Greatest Comedy Films]] poll on [[Channel 4]], beaten by ''[[Monty Python's The Life of Brian]]''. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' voted the film the "Funniest movie on video" in their list of the 100 funniest movies on video.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brod, Doug|title=The Kings of Comedy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 16, 1992|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20162465,00.html|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref>

Several actors were cast to spoof their established images: Nielsen, Stack, and Bridges were known for adventurous, no-nonsense tough-guy characters. Stack's role as the captain who loses his nerve in one of the earliest airline "disaster" films, ''[[The High and the Mighty (film)|The High and the Mighty]]'' (1954), is spoofed in ''Airplane!'', as is [[Lloyd Bridges]]' 1970–1971 television role as airport manager Jim Conrad in ''[[San Francisco International Airport (TV series)|San Francisco International Airport]]''. [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]] was in the made-for-TV-movie ''[[SST: Death Flight]]'', in which an SST was unable to land due to an emergency.

Nielsen saw a major boost to his career after the release of ''Airplane!'', and the film marked a significant change in his film persona: since then he has specialized in playing clueless deadpan bumblers, notably in the three ''[[The Naked Gun (film series)|Naked Gun]]'' films based on the six-episode television series ''[[Police Squad!]]''.  This also led to his casting, many years later, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]''.  Brooks had wanted to make that film for a long time, but put it off because, as he said, "I just could not find the right Dracula."  Brooks claimed to have never seen ''Airplane!'' until years after its release.  When he did, he knew Nielsen would be right for the part. Stack and Bridges saw similar shifts in their public image, though to lesser extents.

Several members of the cast in minor roles went on to better known parts. [[Gregory Itzin]], who appears as one of the religious zealots, played President [[Charles Logan (24 character)|Charles Logan]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. [[David Leisure]], who played one of the [[Hare Krishna]], went on to fame as [[Joe Isuzu]] before appearing as Charlie Dietz in the sitcom ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]''.  [[Michael Warren]], who is seen as one of the patients in the hospital during Ted's flashback, would go on to play Bobby Hill on ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''.  He was also a teammate of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at UCLA. [[Jill Whelan]], who played the little sick girl Lisa Davis, went on to star as Vicki Stubing in [[The Love Boat]].

==Sequel==
''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'', first released on December 10, 1982, attempted to tackle the [[science fiction film]] genre, though there was still emphasis on the general theme of disaster films. Although most of the cast reunited for the sequel, the writers and directors of ''Airplane!'' chose not to be involved.
