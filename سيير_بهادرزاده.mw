==Biography==
Although known primarily for his skills in Muay Thai, Silva is also a black belt in [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], which he earned in 2005 from [[Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira]].<ref>{{cite web

===Early mixed martial arts===
Silva initially fought in the Mecca organization in Brazil. Silva lost his first fight to [[Luiz Azeredo]] by decision. After that fight, he went on a nine-fight winning streak, winning six of those fights by either submission or TKO. His first match in [[Japan]] was against Shooto champion Hayato Sakurai. Silva was the first person to ever beat Sakurai, and became the new Shooto middleweight (167 lb) champion.

===PRIDE Fighting Championships and Cage Rage===
In 2002, Silva began fighting in PRIDE. In his first fight with the promotion, he stopped Alex Steibling with a cut resulting from a high kick. In his next match, he won via decision against the "Diet Butcher" [[Alexander Otsuka]]. At ''[[PRIDE 25]]'', Silva faced former UFC [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]] champion [[Carlos Newton]]. Newton tried to [[Takedown (grappling)|shoot]] in on Silva, but was hit with a flying knee. Newton collapsed and Silva finished the fight with strikes, winning by technical knockout.

At ''[[PRIDE 26]]'', Silva faced [[Daiju Takase]]. Considering his record at the time – with only four wins to seven losses – most predicted that Takase would not win. Surprisingly, Takase submitted Silva with a [[triangle choke]] late in the first round.

After his loss to Takase, Silva fought in other promotions around the world. On [[June 27]], [[2004]], Silva fought [[Jeremy Horn]] and earned a decision victory. Three months later, Silva made his debut in the [[Cage Rage]] promotion in [[England]]. At ''Cage Rage 8'' Silva fought and defeated noted striker [[Lee Murray]] by decision.

That year, Silva returned to PRIDE on [[December 31]]. His opponent was [[Ryo Chonan]]. Silva was in control with a take down and body triangle in the first round. Chonan was able to counter Silva's knees from the clinch, with knees, and takedowns. Despite being the underdog, Chonan was winning the standup with knees and legkicks. The fight ended in the third round when Chonan executed a slick flying [[Leglock#Heel hook|scissor heel hook]], forcing Silva to submit.

After the loss to Chonan, Silva continued fighting in the Cage Rage promotion, as well as other promotions around the world. Silva defended his Cage Rage title against Curtis Stout before fighting in [[Hawaii|Hawaii's]] Rumble on the Rock promotion, where he fought [[Yushin Okami]] in the first round of the 175 lb tournament. Although he was labeled as the favorite to win the tournament, Silva lost his fight when he kicked Okami in the face from the guard position. Okami's knees were on the ground at the time, making the attack an illegal strike to the head of a downed opponent. Silva was disqualified, and returned to Cage Rage once again.

Although he was slated to fight [[Matt Lindland]] at ''Cage Rage 16'', Lindland's decision to fight Mike Van Arsdale at ''Raze Fight Night'' put an end to the highly-anticipated match up. Instead, Silva defended his championship against Tony Fryklund, winning the fight with a reverse elbow, knocking out Fryklund early in the first round.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
<!-- [[Image:Anderson TheSpider Silva.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Anderson Silva]] -->
Although speculation ran rampant about where Silva would sign next, the UFC announced in late April 2006 that they had signed him to a multi-fight contract, one of these fights believed to be for the [[List of UFC champions#Middleweight championship|middleweight title]]. It was not long before the UFC started promoting Silva, releasing an interview segment almost immediately after announcing his arrival.<ref>{{cite web

Silva made his anticipated debut at ''[[UFC Ultimate Fight Night 5|Ultimate Fight Night 5]]'' on [[June 28]], [[2006]]. His opponent was [[Chris Leben]], a contestant from ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 1]]'' [[reality television|reality show]] who had since gone undefeated in the UFC with five consecutive victories. A relatively unknown fighter in the [[United States]], Silva made an emphatic debut when he knocked out Leben with a flurry of strikes, followed by a final knee strike at 49 seconds into the first round. In response to the victory, the UFC quickly tallied a poll on their main page, asking viewers to select Silva's next opponent; the majority of voters selected UFC middleweight champion, [[Rich Franklin]].

Although it is unknown whether the UFC voters had any bearing on the situation, Silva was given his chance at the title at ''[[UFC 64]]'' on [[October 14]], [[2006]]. Silva defeated Franklin by TKO (strikes) at 2:59 in the first round. Silva hit Franklin with knees to the body in the Muay Thai-clinch, then broke Franklin's nose with a knee to the face. Unable to strike back, Franklin dodged the last of Silva's strikes before falling to the ground, where referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|"Big" John McCarthy]] ended the fight. Silva was then crowned the new UFC middleweight champion. Anderson Silva joins Lyoto Machida as the only other man to have beaten Rich Franklin.

On [[February 3]], [[2007]], Silva defeated ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 4]]'' winner [[Travis Lutter]] by submission due to a triangle choke at ''[[UFC 67]]''. What was to be Silva's first title defense since defeating Franklin in October 2006 was quickly changed to a non-title bout following Lutter's unsuccessful attempt to make the 185 pound weight limit for the title contest. Silva won the fight with what was considered his opponent's strongest skill: Brazilian jiu-jitsu.<ref>{{cite web

Silva successfully defended his title against [[Nate Marquardt]] on [[July 7]], [[2007]] in [[Sacramento, California]] on the ''[[UFC 73]]'' card, winning by TKO at 4:50 in the first round.

On [[October 20]], [[2007]] at ''[[UFC 77]]'', Silva defeated Franklin in a rematch by TKO in the 2nd round. The fight was in Franklin's home town of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and took place at the [[U.S. Bank Arena]]<ref name="nok2">{{cite web
