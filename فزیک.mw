'''Physics''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: [[physis]] – φύσις meaning "[[nature]]") is a [[natural science]]; it is the study of [[matter]]<ref name = "feynman">[[R. P. Feynman]], [[R. B. Leighton]], [[Matthew Sands|M. Sands]] (1963), ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', ISBN 0-201-02116-1 Hard-cover. p.1-1 Feynman begins with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?

Van Nostrand. p.1: "Nature of Physical Science – Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature." | accessdate=2008-11-04</ref> More broadly, it is the general analysis of [[nature]], conducted in order to understand how the [[world]] and [[universe]] behave.<ref>H.D. Young & R.A. Freedman, ''University Physics with Modern Physics'': 11th Edition: International Edition (2004), Addison Wesley. Chapter 1, section 1.1, page 2 has this to say: "Physics is an ''experimental'' science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns and principles that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical theories or, when they are very well established and of broad use, physical laws or principles." </br> Steve Holzner, ''Physics for Dummies'' (2006), Wiley. Chapter 1, page 7 says: "Physics is the study of your world and the world and universe around you." See [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0764554336 Amazon Online Reader: Physics For Dummies (For Dummies(Math & Science))], retrieved 24 Nov 2006</ref><ref>Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].</ref>

Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].<ref>Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000BC, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.</ref> Over the last two millennia, physics had been considered synonymous with [[philosophy]], [[chemistry]], and certain branches of [[mathematics]] and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, it emerged to become a unique modern science in its own right.<ref>[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''Novum Organum'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].</ref> However, in some subject areas such as in [[mathematical physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], the boundaries of physics remain difficult to distinguish.

Physics is both significant and influential, in part because advances in its understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics often resonate with the other sciences, mathematics and philosophy. 

For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]] or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society (e.g., television, computers, and domestic appliances); advances in [[thermodynamics]] led to the development of motorized transport; and advances in [[mechanics]] inspired the development of [[calculus]].

== Scope and aims ==
[[دوتنه:Pahoeoe fountain original.jpg|thumb|left|This [[parabola]]-shaped [[lava flow]] illustrates [[Galileo]]'s [[law of falling bodies]] as well as [[blackbody radiation]] – the temperature is discernible from the color of the blackbody.]]

Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from the smallest [[Subatomic particle|sub-atomic particles]] (protons, neutrons and electrons), to the largest [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. Included in this are the very most basic objects from which all other things are composed, and therefore physics is sometimes said to be the "fundamental science".<ref name = "Feynman lectures">''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I. Feynman, Leighton and Sands. ISBN 0-201-02115-3  See Chapter 3 : "The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences" for a general discussion. For the philosophical issue of whether other sciences can be "reduced" to physics, see [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]).</ref>

Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things we see around us to root causes, and then to try to connect these causes together in the hope of finding an [[Theory of Everything|ultimate reason]] for why nature is as it is. 

For example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]]) were attracted to one another by some invisible force. This effect was later called [[magnetism]], and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. 

A little earlier than the Chinese, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century, and came to be called [[electricity]]. 

Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause ([[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force – [[electromagnetism]]. This process of "unifying" forces [[Electroweak interaction|continues today]] (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' for more information).

== The scientific method ==
Physics uses the [[scientific method]] to test the validity of a physical theory, using a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from experiments and observations conducted to test it. Experiments and observations are to be collected and matched with the predictions and hypotheses made by a [[theory]], thus aiding in the determination or the validity/invalidity of the theory.

Theories which are very well supported by data and have never failed any competent empirical test are often called [[scientific law]]s, or natural laws. Of course, all theories, including those called scientific laws, can always be replaced by more accurate, generalized statements if a disagreement of theory with observed data is ever found.<ref>Some principles, such as [[Newton's laws of motion]], are still generally called "laws" even though they are now known to be limiting cases of newer theories. Thus, for example, in [[Thomas Brody]] (1993, Luis de la Peña and Peter Hodgson, eds.) ''The Philosophy Behind Physics'' ISBN 0-387-55914-0, pp 18–24 (Chapter 2), explains the 'epistemic cycle' in which a student of physics discovers that physics is not a finished product but is instead the process of creating [that product].</ref>

== Theory and experiment ==
{{main|Theoretical physics|Experimental physics}}
[[دوتنه:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronaut]] and [[Earth]] are both in [[free-fall]]]]
[[دوتنه:PrismAndLight.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion]] of [[light]] by a [[Dispersive prism|prism]]]]
[[دوتنه:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lightning]] is [[electric current]]]]

The culture of ''physics'' has a higher degree of separation between [[theory]] and [[experiment]] than many other sciences. Since the twentieth century, most individual physicists have specialized in either [[theoretical physics]] or [[experimental physics]]. In contrast, almost all the successful theorists in [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] (e.g. American [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]] and [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Linus Pauling]]) have also been experimentalists, although this is changing as of late.

Theorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire new experiments.

It is also worth noting there are some physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment who are called [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenologists]]. Phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to fundamental theory. 

Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]]; electromagnetism was unified this way.<ref>
See, for example, the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Ritter]] on [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Oersted]].
</ref> Beyond the known universe, the field of [[theoretical physics]] also deals with hypothetical issues,<ref>Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the [[atom]] of nineteenth century physics was denigrated by some, including [[Ernst Mach]]'s critique of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s formulation of [[statistical mechanics]]. By the end of [[World War II]], the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.</ref> such as [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]], a [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]], and [[higher dimension]]s. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.

[[Experiment]]al physics informs, and is informed by, [[engineering]] and [[technology]].  Experimental physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry, developing technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

=== Relation to mathematics and the other sciences ===
In the ''Assayer'' (1622), Galileo noted that mathematics is the language in which Nature expresses its laws.<ref>
"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." – [[Galileo]] (1623), ''[[The Assayer]]'', as quoted by G. Toraldo Di Francia (1976), ''The Investigation of the Physical World'' ISBN 0-521-29925-X p.10 </ref>
Most experimental results in physics are numerical measurements, and theories in physics use mathematics to give numerical results to match these measurements. 

Physics relies upon [[mathematics]] to provide the logical framework in which physical laws may be precisely formulated and predictions quantified. Whenever [[analytic solution]]s of equations are not feasible, [[numerical analysis]] and [[simulation#computer simulation|simulations]] may be utilized. Thus, [[scientific computing|scientific computation]] is an integral part of physics, and the field of [[computational physics]] is an active area of research.

A key difference between physics and mathematics is that since physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the material world, it tests its theories by comparing the predictions of its theories with data procured from observations and experimentation, whereas mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, not limited by those observed in the real world. The distinction, however, is not always clear-cut. There is a large area of research intermediate between physics and mathematics, known as [[mathematical physics]]. 

Physics is also intimately related to many other sciences, as well as applied fields like engineering and medicine. The principles of physics find applications throughout the other [[natural science]]s as some phenomena studied in physics, such as the [[conservation of energy]], are common to ''all'' material systems. Other phenomena, such as [[superconductivity]], stem from these laws, but are not laws themselves because they only appear in some systems. 

Physics is often said to be the "fundamental science" (chemistry is sometimes included), because each of the other disciplines ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[material science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]] etc.) deals with particular types of material systems that obey the laws of physics.<ref name = "Feynman lectures"/> For example, chemistry is the science of collections of matter (such as gases and liquids formed of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s) and the processes known as [[chemical reaction]]s that result in the change of [[chemical substance]]s. 

The structure, reactivity, and properties of a [[chemical compound]] are determined by the properties of the underlying molecules, which may be well-described by areas of physics such as [[quantum mechanics]], or [[quantum chemistry]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[electromagnetism]].

== Philosophical implications ==
{{more|Philosophy of Physics}}

Physics in many ways stems from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. From [[Thales]]' first attempt to characterize matter, to [[Democritus]]' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] of a crystalline [[firmament]], and Aristotle's book ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as "[[Natural philosophy]]".

By the 19th century physics was realized as a [[positive science]] and a distinct discipline separate from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on [[philosophy of science]] to give an adequate description of the scientific method.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Alex|title=Philosophy of Science|publisher=Routledge|date=2006|isbn=0-415-34317-8}} See Chapter 1 for a discussion on the necessity of philosophy of science.</ref> The scientific method employs [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori reasoning]] as well as [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a posteriori]] reasoning and the use of [[Bayesian inference]] to measure the validity of a given theory.<ref>Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 14 "Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence" ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3</ref>

{{cquote|Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.|30px|30px|[[Isaac Newton]]}}

The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the [[philosophy of physics]], involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref>Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 15 "Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?" ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3</ref>

Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance [[Laplace]], who championed [[causal determinism]],<ref>See Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated from the 6th French edition by Frederick Wilson Truscott and Frederick Lincoln Emory, Dover Publications (New York, 1951)</ref> and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who wrote on Quantum Mechanics.<ref>See "The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics" Ox Bow Press (1995) ISBN 1-881987-09-4. and "My View of the World" Ox Bow Press (1983) ISBN 0-918024-30-7.</ref> The mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] has been called a [[Platonist]] by [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref> Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose (1996), ''The Nature of Space and Time'' ISBN 0-691-05084-8 p.4 "I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself." </ref> a view Penrose discusses in his book, ''The Road to Reality''.<ref>Roger Penrose, ''The Road to Reality'' ISBN 0-679-45443-8</ref> Hawking refers to himself as an "unashamed reductionist" and takes issue with Penrose's views.<ref>{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|coauthors=Abner Shimony, Nancy Cartwright, Stephen Hawking|title=The Large, the Small and the Human Mind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|isbn=0-521-78572-3}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of physics}}
[[دوتنه:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]]]]

Since antiquity, people have tried to understand the behavior of the natural world. One great mystery was the predictable behavior of celestial objects such as the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]]. Several theories were proposed, the majority of which were disproved. 

Early physical theories were largely couched in philosophical terms, and never verified by systematic experimental testing as is popular today. Many of the commonly accepted works of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] are not always found to match everyday observations. 

Even so, [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and [[Indian astronomy|astronomers]] gave many correct descriptions in [[atomism]] and [[astronomy]], and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thinker [[Archimedes]] derived many correct quantitative descriptions of [[mechanics]] and [[hydrostatics]]. A more [[experimental physics]] began taking shape among [[Physics in medieval Islam|medieval Muslim physicists]], while modern physics largely took shape among [[early modern Europe]]an physicists.

== Core theories of physics ==

While physics deals with a wide variety of systems, there are certain theories that are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of Nature (within a certain domain of validity). 

For instance, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research; for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727). 

These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[special relativity]].

== Research fields ==
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[particle physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; [[geophysics]] and [[biophysics]]. Some physics departments also support research in [[Physics education]]. 

Since the twentieth century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialization of knowledge|specialized]], and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) and [[Lev Landau]] (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.<ref>
Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [[World Wide Web]], which was innovated at [[CERN]] by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [[arXiv.org]]

==== Condensed matter ====
{{main|Condensed matter physics}}
[[دوتنه:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|350px|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]]

[[Condensed matter physics]] is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of [[matter]]. In particular, it is concerned with the "condensed" [[phase (matter)|phases]] that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. 

The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[Solid-state physics|solids]] and [[liquid]]s, which arise from the bonding and [[electromagnetic force]] between [[atom]]s. More exotic condensed phases include the [[superfluid]] and the [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] found in certain atomic systems at very low [[temperature]], the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by [[conduction electron]]s in certain materials, and the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice|atomic lattices]].

Condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of [[solid-state physics]], which is now considered one of its main subfields. The term ''condensed matter physics'' was apparently coined by [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] when he renamed his research group — previously ''solid-state theory'' — in 1967. 

In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics at the [[American Physical Society]] was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.<ref name=dcmp_governance>{{cite web | url =  http://dcmp.bc.edu/page.php?name=governance_history | title = Division of Condensed Matter Physics Governance History | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref>  Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[engineering]].

==== Atomic, molecular, and optical physics ====

[[Atom]]ic, [[Molecule|molecular]], and [[Optics|optical]] physics (AMO) is the study of [[matter]]-matter and [[light]]-matter interactions on the scale of single [[atom]]s or structures containing a few atoms. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of the [[energy]] scales that are relevant. All three areas include both [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

[[Atomic physics]] studies the [[electron]] shells of [[atom]]s.  Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics, the collective behavior of atoms in weakly interacting gases (Bose-Einstein Condensates and dilute Fermi degenerate systems), precision measurements of fundamental constants, and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics.  Atomic physics is influenced by the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (see, e.g., [[hyperfine splitting]]), but intra-nuclear phenomenon such as [[nuclear fission|fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] are considered part of [[high energy physics]].

[[Molecular physics]] focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light.  [[Optical physics]] is distinct from [[optics]] in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects, but on the fundamental properties of [[optical field]]s and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.

==== High energy/particle physics ====

[[دوتنه:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|A simulated event in the CMS detector of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], featuring a possible appearance of the [[Higgs boson]].]]

[[Particle physics]] is the study of the [[elementary particle|elementary]] constituents of [[matter]] and [[energy]], and the [[interactions]] between them. It may also be called "high energy physics", because many elementary particles do not occur naturally, but are created only during high energy [[collision]]s of other particles, as can be detected in [[particle accelerator]]s.

Currently, the interactions of elementary particles are described by the [[Standard Model]]. The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter that interact via the [[strong nuclear force|strong]], [[weak nuclear force|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental force]]s.  Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging messenger particles that carry the forces.  These messenger particles are known as [[gluon]]s; [[W boson|W<sup>−</sup> and W<sup>+</sup>]] and [[Z boson]]s; and the [[photon]]s, respectively. The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the [[Higgs boson|Higgs]] [[boson]], the existence of which has not yet been verified.

==== Astrophysics ====
{{main|Astrophysics|Physical cosmology}}
[[دوتنه:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]]

[[Astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]] are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of [[stellar structure]], [[stellar evolution]], the origin of the [[solar system]], and related problems of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

The discovery by [[Karl Jansky]] in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth’s atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]], [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]], and [[X-ray astronomy]]. 

[[Physical cosmology]] is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery that the universe was expanding, as shown by the [[Hubble diagram]], prompted rival explanations known as the [[steady state]] universe and the [[Big Bang]].

The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the [[cosmological principle]]. Cosmologists have recently established a [[Lambda-CDM model|precise model]] of the evolution of the universe, which includes [[cosmic inflation]], [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]].

== Fundamental physics ==

[[دوتنه:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|350px|right|The basic domains of physics]]

While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of [[classical physics]] accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match their predictions. [[Albert Einstein]] contributed the framework of [[special relativity]], which replaced notions of absolute time and space with [[spacetime]] and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Max Planck]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and others introduced [[quantum mechanics]], a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [[quantum field theory]] unified [[quantum mechanics]] and [[special relativity]]. [[General relativity]] allowed for a dynamical, curved [[spacetime]], with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions.

== Application and influence ==
{{main|Applied physics}}
[[دوتنه:IMG 1729 Gemaal met schroef van Archimedes bij Kinderdijk.JPG|thumb|right|[[Archimedes' screw]] uses [[simple machine]]s to lift [[liquids]].]]

[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular [[Utility|use]]. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem. 

The approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.

Physics is used heavily in [[engineering]]. For example, [[Statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other structures. The understanding and use of [[acoustics]] results in better concert halls; similarly, the use of [[optics]] creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, video games, and movies, and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.

With the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin|study of the origin of the Earth]], one can reasonably model Earth's [[mass]], [[temperature]], and rate of [[rotation]], over [[time]]. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.
 
But there is also considerable [[interdisciplinarity]] in the physicist's methods, and so many other important fields are influenced by physics: e.g. presently the fields of [[econophysics]] plays an important role, as well as sociophysics.

== Current research ==
{{further|[[Unsolved problems in physics]]}}
[[دوتنه:Feynman'sDiagram.JPG|thumb|right|[[Feynman diagram]] signed by [[R. P. Feynman]]]]

Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.{{fact|date=April 2009}}

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]], and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. In the next several years, [[particle accelerator]]s will begin probing energy scales in the [[TeV]] range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence<ref>

</ref> for the [[Higgs boson]] and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]].

Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the existence of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]] and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]]. 

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving [[complex systems|complexity]], [[chaos]], or [[turbulence]] are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections. 

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways.  Complex physics has become part of increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] research, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]] and the observation of [[pattern formation]] in [[biology|biological]] systems. In 1932, [[Horace Lamb]] said:
{{cquote|I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.|30px|30px|[[Horace Lamb]]<ref>{{cite journal
 | last=Goldstein | first=Sydney
