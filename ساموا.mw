'''Samoa''', officially the '''Independent State of Samoa''', is a country comprising a [[island group|group of islands]] in the South [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Geographical renaming|Previous names]] were '''German Samoa''' from [[1900]] to [[1919]], and '''Western Samoa''' from [[1914]] to [[1997]]. It was recognized by the [[United Nations]] only on 15 December [[1976]] ([http://www.un.org/Overview/unmember.html UN members]) as Samoa. The entire group was known as '''Navigators Islands''' before the 20th century because of the Samoans' excellent seafaring skills. It has a population of 176,710 (2001 census).

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[History of Samoa]]''

The first Polynesians to arrive in the Samoan Islands came over several generations from Southeast Asia, via [[Fiji]] and [[Tonga]], more than 3000 years ago and from there settled the rest of [[Polynesia]]: first traveling eastward to the [[Marquesas Islands]], and from there southwest, via the [[Society Islands]] to [[New Zealand]], southeast to [[Easter Island]], and northward to [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]]. Samoa enjoys a rich history, preserved in folklore and myth, of voyages across the ocean, conquests of different islands, and interisland warfare with other West Polynesian polities, mainly the Kingdom of Tonga and certain Fijian chieftainships. Some people believe that a temple on the island of Manono has a record, using a system of stone cairns, that commemorates more than 150 wars. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], who spent the last four years of his life in Samoa, remarked that "War is Samoa's favourite pastime."

Contact with [[Europe]]ans began in 1722, but intensified after the 1830s, when [[England|English]] [[missionaries]] and traders began arriving. Mission work in Samoa was begun in late 1830 by [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], of the [[London Missionary Society]]. By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike, as they had clashed with French, British, German, and American forces, who, by the late nineteenth century, valued Samoa as a refueling station for coal-fired shipping. 

As Germany began to show more interest in the Samoan Islands, the United States laid its own claim to them; Britain sent troops to express its interest. There followed an eight-year civil war. Each of the three powers supplied arms, training, and in some cases combat troops, to the warring Samoan parties. All three sent warships into Apia harbor, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent, until a massive storm damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Treaty of Berlin split the [[Samoa Islands|Samoan Islands]] into two parts: the eastern group became a territory of the [[United States]] (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1905), and are today known as [[American Samoa]]; the western islands, by far the greater landmass, became known as German Samoa after the British gave up claims to the islands in return for Fiji and some Melanesian territories. [[New Zealand]] troops landed in 'Upolu on 29 August 1914 and seized control from the German authorities; after that, the western islands became known as Western Samoa.

From the end of the Great War (World War I) until 1962, New Zealand controlled Samoa as a Class "C" Mandate under [[trusteeship]] through the [[League of Nations]], followed by the United Nations. Though never a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], it enjoyed many benefits through its relationship with New Zealand. The Western Samoans began a campaign known as the [[Mau movement|Mau]] ('Opinion') to protest the foreign administration, claiming mistreatment of the Samoan people and blaming outsiders for the death of a fourth or fifth of the population during the Spanish flu pandemic, which ravaged the western islands and much of the world in 1918. (A prompt quarantine by authorities in American Samoa spared the eastern islands.) In 1962, Western Samoa became the first Pacific Island state to regain its independence. In many ways though, it remains closely tied to New Zealand.

In July [[1997]], the constitution was amended to change the country's name from ''Western Samoa'' to ''Samoa.'' Samoa had been known simply as ''Samoa'' in the [[United Nations]] since joining the organization, in [[1976]]. The U.S. territory of [[American Samoa]] protested the move, asserting that the change diminished its own identity. American Samoans still use the terms ''Western Samoa'' and ''Western Samoans'' to describe the independent State of Samoa and its inhabitants. While the two Samoas share language and ethnicity, their cultures have recently followed different paths, with American Samoans often emigrating to [[Hawai'i]] and the U.S. mainland and adopting many U.S. customs, such as the playing of [[American football]] and [[baseball]]. Western Samoans have tended to emigrate to New Zealand, whose influence has made the sports of [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]] more popular in the western islands.

{{morepolitics|country=Samoa}}
Politics of Samoa takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Samoa]] is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multiparty system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Fono]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

== Districts ==
''Main article: [[Districts of Samoa]]'' 
Samoa is made up of 11 '''districts''', some of which are split between different parts of the islands.

== جغرافيه ==
[[دوتنه:Samoa Country map.png|thumb|Map of Samoa]]
The country is located east of the international dateline and south of the equator, about halfway between [[Hawai'i]] and [[New Zealand]] in the [[Polynesia]]n region of the Pacific Ocean. The Samoas are of volcanic origin, and the total land area is 2934 km², consisting of the two large islands of [[Upolu]] and [[Savai'i]] which account for 96% of the total land area, and eight small islets: [[Manono]], [[Apolima]], [[Nu'utele]], [[Nu'ulua]], [[Namua]], [[Fanuatapu]], [[Nu'usafe'e]], and [[Nu'ulopa]]. While all of the islands have volcanic origins, only Savai'i has had recent eruptions and could be considered volcanically active: the last major eruption occurred in the 1700s, and smaller eruptions occurred in the first decade of the twentieth century. The highest point in Samoa is Mauga Silisili, at 1858 m. The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters of Samoa's population, and its capital city is [[Apia, Samoa|Apia]]. The climate is tropical, with an average annual temperature of 26.5&nbsp;°C, and a rainy season from November to April.

''Main article: [[Economy of Samoa]]''

The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on [[development aid]], private family [[remittances from overseas]], and [[agricultural exports]]. The country is vulnerable to devastating storms. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force, and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring [[coconut]] cream, coconut oil, noni [''sic''] (juice of the ''nonu'' [''sic''] fruit), and [[copra]]. Outside of a large automotive wire-harness factory, the manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. [[Tourism]] is an expanding sector; more than 70,000 tourists visited the islands in 1996. The Samoan government has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline. Observers point to the flexibility of the labor market as a basic strength for future economic advances.

Samoa is a fertile, fruitful, productive country. In the period before German colonization, it produced mostly copra. German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale plantation operations and developing new industries, notably cocoa and rubber, relying on imported laborers from China and Melanesia. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. 

Because of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interest. Of the total land area of 2,934 km² (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable.  About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WESTC).  

The staple products of Samoa are [[copra]] (dried coconut meat), cocoa (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons. If the rhinoceros beetle in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons of copra. Cocoa is of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most cocoa trees are Criollo-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy.

Other agricultural industries have been less successful. Sugarcane production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of Apia. Pineapples grow well in Samoa, but beyond local consumption have not been a major export.

In the late 1960s, Potlatch Forests, Inc. (a U.S. company), upgraded the harbor and airport at Asau on the northern coast of Savai'i and established a timber operation, Samoa Forest Products, for harvesting tropical hardwoods. Potlatch invested about US$2,500,000 in a state-of-the-art sawmill and another US$6,000,000 over several years to develop power, water, and haul roads for their facility. Asau, with the Potlatch sawmillers and Samoa Forest Products, was one of the busiest parts of Savai'i in the 1960s and 1970s; however, the departure of Potlatch and the scaling down of the sawmill has left Asau a ghost town in recent years.

Fishing has had some success in Samoan waters, but the biggest fisheries industry (headed by Van Camp and StarKist) has been based in American Samoa. StarKist Management announced that it was going ahead with setting up at Asau a blast-freezer project to be operational by 2002. This announcement dispelled a growing suspicion about the genuine motives of StarKist to move to Samoa. The proposed blast-freezer operations in Asau were expected to bring this village back to life.

== سپورټ ==
The main sports played in Samoa are [[Rugby]] and Samoan cricket.

Rugby is very popular in Samoa and many Samoans are avid supporters of the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] rugby team. There are many Samoans that have played for or are playing for the All Blacks. Some well known players include [[Keven Mealamu]], [[Tana Umaga]], [[Rodney So'oialo]] and [[Jerry Collins]].

== Wrestling Tradition ==
Samoans have been very visible in American [[professional wrestling]], despite the relatively small population of the islands. [[The Rock]], [[Umaga]], [[Rosey]], [[Samoa Joe]], [[The Headshrinkers]], [[Rikishi]] and [[Sonny Siaki]] all share Samoan heritage.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Samoa]]''

The [[fa'a Samoa]], or traditional Samoan way, remains a strong force in Samoan life and politics. Despite centuries of [[Europe]]an influence, Samoa maintains its historical customs, social systems, and [[Samoan language|language]], a [[Polynesian language]]. Only the [[Māori]] of [[New Zealand]] outnumber Samoans among [[Polynesia]]n groups, but a larger portion of Māori identify with more than one ethnic group.

100% of Samoans are [[Christians]], divided among many different churches, including: [[Assembly of God]] (37.6%), [[Congregationalist]], originally called the London Missionary Society Church (L.M.S.) (24.8%), [[Roman Catholic]] (19.6%), [[Methodist]] (5%), [[Latter-Day Saints]] (2.7%), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] (3.5%), and other Christian sects (3.5%). Hardly any other religious group exists in Samoa, except for the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], who make up about 2% of the population. The Head of State, His Highness Mālietoa Tanumafili II, is a Bahá'í. Samoa hosts one of seven [[Bahá'í House of Worship|Bahá'í Houses of Worship]] in the world; completed in 1984 and dedicated by the Head of State, it is located in [[Tiapapata]], 8 km from Apia.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Samoa has a large gender imbalance. [http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbsum.pl?cty=WS]. The cause of this imbalance is uncertain, but large-scale emigration of women may be relevant.

== هڅوب ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Samoa]]''

Samoans are typically friendly and welcoming people.  They have a distinct culture in which they have great pride.

Samoans have a communal way of life with little privacy: they do all their activities together and even traditional [[fales]] (houses) have no walls, and just use blinds made of coconut leaves during the night or bad weather.  

Sundays are traditionally a day of rest, and many families congregate to share an umu together for a Sunday afternoon meal.  

Samoa is a deeply religious country despite ancient Samoan culture being contrary to the Church's beliefs, for example, belief in [[aitu]] (spirits). [[Christianity]] is the main religion and there are many churches to be found around the islands, and are often full on Sundays {{fact}}.  

Samoan handicrafts can be found at the craft market and some shops.  These include the [[siapo]] (equivalent to the [[Fiji]]an [[tapa]]) which is made from beaten [[mulberry|mulberry bark]], and then patterns or pictures are painted on with a natural brown dye.  

The traditional Samoan [[dance]] is the Siva.  This is similar to the Hawaiian dance, with gentle movements of the hands and feet in time to music and which tells a story.  

Traditional Samoan medicine is often practised as a first-line before hospital medicine.  This is a type of alternative medicine using plant leaves to massage the affected area.

The traditional women’s clothing is the [[puletasi]] which is a matching skirt and tunic with Samoan designs.  Some men have intricate and geometrical patterns [[tattoo]]ed onto their lower body and upper legs.
