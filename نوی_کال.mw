The '''Gregorian calendar''' is the most widely used [[calendar]] in the World.  A modification of the [[Julian calendar]], it was first proposed by the [[Calabria]]n doctor [[Aloysius Lilius]], and was decreed by [[Pope Gregory XIII]], for whom it was named, on [[24 February]] [[1582]] via the [[papal bull]] ''[[Inter gravissimas]]''. Years in the calendar are numbered from the traditional birth year of [[Jesus]], which has been labeled the "[[anno Domini]]" (AD) era<ref>This era was created in the [[6th century]] by [[Rome|Roman]] [[monk]] [[Dionysius Exiguus]]</ref>, and is sometimes labeled the "[[common era]]" or the "Christian era" (CE).

The Gregorian Calendar was devised both because the lunar calendar had grown conspicuously wrong, and the mean [[Julian Calendar]] year is slightly too long, so that the [[vernal equinox]] slowly drifts backwards through Julian calendar years.  This caused problems in computing the [[computus|date of Easter]].

The Gregorian calendar system dealt with these problems by dropping a certain number of days to bring the calendar back into synchronization with the seasons, and then slightly shortening the average number of days in a calendar year, by omitting three Julian leap-days every 400 years. The days omitted are in the century years (specifically: 29 February 1700, 1800, 1900; 2100, 2200, 2300; 2500, 2600, 2700; 2900, etc., are dropped).     

==Description==

The Gregorian solar calendar is an arithmetical calendar.  It counts days as the basic unit of time, grouping them into years of 365 or 366 days.  The solar calendar repeats completely every 146,097 days, which fill 400 years, and which also happens to be 20871 seven-day [[week]]s.  Of these 400 years, 303 (the "common years") have 365 days, and 97 - the [[leap year]]s - have 366 days.  This gives an average year length of exactly 365.2425 days - or 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds.

A Gregorian year is divided into twelve [[month]]s of irregular length (but note that there is a period of 153 days divided over 5 months in an alternating pattern from March to July that repeats from August to December):

A calendar date is fully specified by the year (numbered by some scheme beyond the scope of the calendar itself), the month (identified by name or number), and the day of the month (numbered sequentially starting at 1).

[[Leap year]]s are all years divisible by 4, with the exception of those divisible by 100, but not by 400. These 366-day years add a 29th day to February, which normally has 28 days. Thus, the essential ongoing differential feature of the Gregorian calendar, as opposed to the Julian calendar, is that the Gregorian omits 3 leap days every 400 years. This difference would have been more noticeable in modern memory, were it not for the fact that the year 2000 was a leap year in both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems.

The [[intercalation|intercalary]] day in a leap year is known as a [[leap day]].  Since Roman times [[24 February]] ([[bissextile]]) was counted as the leap day, but nowadays [[29 February]] is regarded as the leap day in most countries.

Although the calendar year runs from [[1 January]] to [[31 December]], sometimes year numbers were based on a different starting point within the calendar.  Confusingly, the term "Anno Domini" is not specific on this point, and actually refers to a family of year numbering systems with different starting points for the years. (See the section below for more on this issue.)

==History==
===Gregorian reform===
The motivation of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in adjusting the calendar was to celebrate [[Easter]] at the time they thought was agreed to at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in [[325]]. Although a canon of the council implies that all churches used the same Easter, they did not. The Church of Alexandria celebrated Easter on the Sunday after the 14th day of the Moon (computed using the [[Metonic cycle]]) that falls on or after the [[vernal equinox]], which they placed on [[21 March]]. However, the Church of Rome still regarded [[25 March]] as the equinox and used a different cycle to compute the day of the Moon. By the tenth century all churches (except for some on the eastern border of the [[Byzantine Empire]]) had adopted the Alexandrian Easter, which still placed the vernal equinox on [[21 March]], although [[Bede]] had already noted its drift in 725—it had drifted even further by the sixteenth century.

Worse, the reckoned Moon that was used to [[computus|compute Easter]] was fixed to the Julian year by a [[Metonic cycle|19 year cycle]]. However, that approximation built up an error of one day every 310 years, so by the sixteenth century the lunar calendar was out of phase with the real Moon by four days.

The [[Council of Trent]] approved a plan in [[1563]] for correcting the calendrical errors, requiring that the date of the [[vernal equinox]] be restored to that which it held at the time of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and that an alteration to the calendar be designed to prevent future drift.  This would allow for a more consistent and accurate scheduling of the feast of [[Easter]].

The fix was to come in two stages. First, it was necessary to approximate the correct length of a solar year. The value chosen was 365.2425 days in decimal notation. This is 365;14,33 days in [[sexagesimal]] notation—the length of the [[tropical year]], rounded to two sexagesimal positions; this was the value used in the major astronomical tables of the day. Although close to the [[mean tropical year]] of 365.24219 days, it is even closer to the [[vernal equinox year]] of 365.2424 days; this fact made the choice of approximation particularly appropriate as the purpose of creating the calendar was to ensure that the vernal equinox would be near a specific date ([[21 March]]). (See [[#Accuracy|Accuracy]]).

The second stage was to devise a model based on the approximation which would provide an accurate yet simple, rule-based calendar.  The formula designed by [[Aloysius Lilius]] was ultimately successful.  It proposed a 10-day correction to revert the drift since Nicaea, and the imposition of a leap day in only 97 years in 400 rather than in 1 year in 4. To implement the model, it was provided that ''years divisible by 100 would be [[leap year]]s only if they were divisible by 400 as well''. So, in the last millennium, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. In this millennium, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 will not be leap years, but 2400 will be. This theory was expanded upon by [[Christopher Clavius]] in a closely argued, 800 page volume. He would later defend his and Lilius's work against detractors.

The 19-year cycle used for the lunar calendar was also to be corrected by one day every 300 or 400 years (8 times in 2500 years) along with corrections for the years (1700, 1800, 1900, 2100 et cetera) that are no longer leap years. In fact, a new method for [[Computus|computing the date of Easter]] was introduced.

Lilius originally proposed that the 10-day correction should be implemented by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences during a period of 40 years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to [[21 March]]. However, Clavius's opinion was that the correction should take place in one move and it was this advice which prevailed with Gregory.  Accordingly, when the new calendar was put in use, the error accumulated in the 13 centuries since the Council of Nicaea was corrected by a deletion of ten days. The last day of the Julian calendar was Thursday [[4 October]] [[1582]] and this was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday [[15 October]] [[1582]] (the cycle of weekdays was not affected). Nevertheless, the dates "[[5 October]] [[1582]]" to "[[14 October]] [[1582]]" (inclusive) are still valid in virtually all countries because most non-Catholic countries initially rejected the reform and even most Catholic countries did not adopt the new calendar on the date specified by the bull but only with some delay.

===Adoption===
[[Image:William Hogarth 028.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Hogarth]] (''c.'' [[1755]]) painting which is the main source for "Give us our Eleven Days"]]

Only [[Spain]] and its territories, [[Portugal]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and most of [[Italy]] implemented the new calendar on Friday, [[15 October]] [[1582]], following Julian Thursday, [[4 October]] [[1582]]. [[France]] adopted the new calendar on Monday, [[20 December]] [[1582]], following Sunday, [[9 December]] [[1582]].<ref>[http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.html#France Toke Nørby. The Perpetual Calendar: What about France?]</ref> The Protestant [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] provinces of Holland and Zeeland also adopted it in December of that year.

Most non-Catholic countries initially objected to adopting a Catholic invention. The [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and thereby the rest of the [[British Empire]] (including the eastern part of what is now the [[United States]]) did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752; by which time it was necessary to correct by ''eleven'' days (Wednesday, [[2 September]] [[1752]] being followed by Thursday, [[14 September]] [[1752]]) to account for [[29 February]] [[1700]] (Julian).  A few years later, when the son of [[George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield|the Earl of Macclesfield]] (who had been influential in passing the calendar law) ran for a seat in [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] in Oxfordshire as a Whig in 1754, dissatisfaction with the calendar reforms was one of a number of issues raised by his Tory opponents.  In 1755, William Hogarth made a painting (and an engraved print from the painting) loosely based on these elections, in which the campaign slogan "Give us our Eleven Days" appears (on floor at lower right); this was later misunderstood, giving rise to apocryphal stories of widespread riots at the change-over. 

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] legislated special provisions to make sure that monthly or yearly payments would not become due until the dates that they originally would have in the Julian calendar. From 1753 until 1799, the tax year in Great Britain began on [[5 April]], which was the "old style" new year of [[25 March]]. A 12th skipped Julian leap day in 1800 changed its start to [[6 April]]. It was not changed when a 13th Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the tax year in the [[United Kingdom]] is still [[6 April]]. 

[[Old Style and New Style dates|"Old Style"]] (OS) and [[Old Style and New Style dates|"New Style"]] (NS) are sometimes added to dates to identify which system is used in the [[British Empire]] and other countries that did not immediately change. In Britain it is usual to map most dates from the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]] onto the Gregorian year without converting the day and month. But because the start of the year did not change until the same year that the Gregorian calendar was introduced, OS/NS is particularly relevant for dates which fall between [[1 January]] and [[25 March]]. For example the execution of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] is usually recorded as having taken place on [[30 January]] [[1649]] (NS), but in contemporary documents it is recorded as having taken place on [[30 January]] [[1648]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26211#s5 House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 9 June, 1660] Regicides.</ref>

[[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and the Protestant states of [[Germany]] adopted the solar portion of the new calendar on Monday, [[1 March]] [[1700]],<ref>[http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.html Toke Nørby. The Perpetual Calendar]</ref>, following Sunday, [[18 February]] [[1700]], due to the influence of [[Ole Rømer]], but did not adopt the lunar portion. Instead, they decided to calculate the date of Easter astronomically using the instant of the vernal equinox and the full moon according to [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s ''Rudolphine Tables'' of 1627. They finally adopted the lunar portion of the Gregorian calendar in 1776. The remaining provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] also adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1700.

[[Sweden]]'s relationship with the Gregorian Calendar had a difficult birth. Sweden started to make the change from the OS calendar and towards the NS calendar in 1700, but it was decided to make the (then 11 day) adjustment gradually, by excluding the leap days ([[29 February]]) from each of 11 successive leap years, 1700 to 1740. In the meantime, not only would the Swedish calendar be out of step with both the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar for 40 years, but also the difference would not be static but would change every 4 years. This strange system clearly had great potential for endless confusion when working out the dates of Swedish events in this 40 year period. To make matters worse, the system was poorly administered and the leap days that should have been excluded from 1704 and 1708 were not excluded. The Swedish calendar should by now have been 8 days behind the Gregorian, but it was still in fact 10 days behind. King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] wisely recognised that the gradual change to the new system was not working and he abandoned it. However, rather than now proceeding directly to the Gregorian calendar (as in hindsight seems to have been the sensible and obvious thing to do), it was decided to revert to the Julian calendar. This was achieved by introducing the unique date [[30 February]] in the year 1712, adjusting the discrepancy in the calendars from 10 back to 11 days. Sweden finally adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1753, when Wednesday, [[17 February]] was followed by Thursday, [[1 March]].<ref>Mike Spathaky ''[http://www.genfair.com/dates.htm Old Style and New Style Dates and the change to the Gregorian Calendar: A summary for genealogists]''</ref>

In [[Alaska]], the change took place when Friday, [[October 6]], [[1867]] was followed again by Friday, [[October 18]] after the US purchase of Alaska from Russia, which was still on the Julian calendar. Instead of 12 days, only 11 were skipped, and the day of the week was repeated on successive days, because the [[International Date Line]] was shifted from Alaska's eastern to western boundary along with the change to the Gregorian calendar.

In [[Russia]] the Gregorian calendar was accepted after the [[October Revolution]] (so named because it took place in October 1917 in the Julian calendar).  On [[24 January]] [[1918]] the [[Sovnarkom|Council of People's Commissars]] issued a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]] that Wednesday, [[31 January]] [[1918]] was to be followed by Thursday, [[14 February]] [[1918]].

The last country of Eastern Orthodox Europe to adopt the Gregorian calendar was [[Greece]] on Thursday, [[1 March]] [[1923]], following Wednesday, [[15 February]] [[1923]]. However, these were all civil adoptions—none of the national churches accepted it. Instead, a [[Revised Julian calendar]] was proposed in May 1923 which dropped 13 days in 1923 and adopted a different leap year rule that resulted in no difference between the two calendars until 2800. The Orthodox churches of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Cyprus]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Polish Orthodox Church|Poland]], and [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]] adopted the Revised Julian calendar, so these [[New calendarists]] would celebrate the Nativity along with the Western churches on [[25 December]] in the Gregorian calendar until 2800. The Orthodox churches of [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgia]] and the [[Greek Old Calendarists]] did not accept the Revised Julian calendar. These [[Old Calendarists]] continue to celebrate the Nativity on [[25 December]] in the Julian calendar, which is [[7 January]] in the Gregorian calendar until 2100. All of the other Eastern churches, the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches ([[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]], [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church|Eritrean]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]]) and the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]], continue to use their own calendars, which usually result in fixed dates being celebrated in accordance with the Julian calendar. All Eastern churches continue to use the Julian Easter with the sole exception of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], which has adopted the Gregorian Easter.

====Adoption in East Asia====

The [[Republic of China]] (ROC) formally adopted the Gregorian calendar at its founding on [[1 January]] [[1912]], but China soon descended into a period of warlordism with different warlords using different calendars. With the [[Northern Expedition|unification]] of China under the [[Kuomintang]] in October 1928, the [[Nationalist Government]] decreed that effective [[1 January]] [[1929]] the Gregorian calendar would be used henceforth. However, China retained the Chinese traditions of numbering the months and a modified [[Era System]], backdating the first year of the ROC to 1912; this system is still in use in [[Taiwan]] where this ROC government retains control. Upon its foundation in 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] continued to use the Gregorian calendar with numbered months, but abolished the ROC Era System and adopted the Western fashion of naming years.

[[Japan]] replaced the traditional lunisolar calendar with the Gregorian calendar on [[1 January]] [[1873]], but, like China, continued to number the months, and used reign names instead of the [[Common Era]]: ''Meiji'' 1=1868, ''Taisho'' 1=1912, ''Showa'' 1=1926, ''Heisei'' 1=1989, and so on. The "Western calendar" (西暦, ''seireki'') using western year numbers, is also widely accepted by civilians and to a lesser extent by government agencies.

[[Korea]] started using the Gregorian calendar on [[1 January]] [[1896]] due to Japanese influence. The lunisolar [[Korean calendar]] used immediately before that day was based on the lunisolar [[Chinese calendar]].<ref>[http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200502/kt2005020616470454130.htm The Korea Times : <nowiki>[The Dawn of Modern Korea]</nowiki> (266) Lunar Calendar]</ref>

==Proleptic Gregorian calendar==
The Gregorian calendar can, for certain purposes, be extended backwards to dates preceding its official introduction, producing the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. However, this proleptic calendar should be used with great caution.

For ordinary purposes, the dates of events occurring prior to [[15 October]] [[1582]] are generally shown as they appeared in the Julian calendar, and '''not''' converted into their Gregorian equivalents.

However, events occurring in countries where the Gregorian calendar was introduced later than [[4 October]] [[1582]] are a little more contentious.  For example, in Great Britain and its overseas possessions (then including the American colonies), the new calendar was not introduced until [[14 September]] [[1752]]. How, then, would people date events occurring in Britain and her possessions in the 170 years between 1582 and 1752? The answer depends very much on the context, but writers who want to avoid confusion make it absolutely clear which calendar is being used. People have avoided changing historical records in Britain deriving from this period; however, it is often highly desirable to translate particular [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] dates into their [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] equivalents, such as where the context includes reference to other countries that had already converted to New Style before Britain did. Astronomers avoid this ambiguity by the use of the [[Julian day number]].

If comparisons of dates are done using different calendars, we can encounter logical absurdities such as [[William and Mary]] of Orange seeming to arrive in London to accept the English crown, a week or so before they left the [[Netherlands]]; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] apparently dying on exactly the same date ([[23 April]] [[1616]]), when in fact Cervantes predeceased Shakespeare by 10 days in real time. This coincidence however has allowed [[UNESCO]] to make [[23 April]] the [[World Book and Copyright Day]].

For dates before the year 1, unlike the proleptic Gregorian calendar used in the [[international standard]] [[ISO 8601]], the traditional proleptic Gregorian calendar (like the Julian calendar) does not have a [[year zero|year 0]] and instead uses the ordinal numbers 1, 2, … both for years AD and BC and for CE and BCE. Thus the traditional timeline is 2 BC, 1 BC, AD 1, and AD 2. ISO 8601 uses [[astronomical year numbering]] which includes a year 0 and negative numbers before it. Thus the ISO 8601 timeline is -0001, 0000, 0001, and 0002.

==Confusion with British versus American usage==
Dates of events in Britain prior to 1752 are usually now shown in their original Old Style form, whereas dates of events in (then British) America prior to 1752 are usually now shown in the New Style form.

* For example, Shakespeare died on [[23 April]] (OS), and it is rare to see this converted to [[3 May]] (NS). But while [[George Washington]] was born on [[11 February]] (OS), his birthday is now celebrated on [[22 February]] (NS), even though he himself continued to celebrate his birthday on February 11.

However, neither of these practices is universal in either country, so it is sometimes very unclear which calendar is being used, and this can lead to false assumptions, which can lead to dates being inaccurately converted from one calendar to the other. Since the resurgence of interest in the history of the calendar, more information about the real dates (according to various calendars) of events has been forthcoming and many previous errors have been corrected. While these changes are welcome, there is still much scope for confusion; specifically noting the calendar being used can help the reader understand the dates involved.

==Difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates==
Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, the difference between faster Gregorian (New Style) and slower Julian (Old Style) calendar dates has increased as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Gregorian range || Julian range || Difference
|-
|From [[15 October]] [[1582]] <br> to [[28 February]] [[1700]]
|From [[5 October]] [[1582]] <br> to [[18 February]] [[1700]]
|10 days
|-
|From [[1 March]] [[1700]] <br> to [[28 February]] [[1800]]
|From [[19 February]] [[1700]] <br> to [[17 February]] [[1800]]
|11 days
|-
|From [[1 March]] [[1800]] <br> to [[28 February]] [[1900]]
|From [[18 February]] [[1800]] <br> to [[16 February]] [[1900]]
|12 days
|-
|From [[1 March]] [[1900]] <br> to [[28 February]] [[2100]]
|From [[17 February]] [[1900]] <br> to [[15 February]] [[2100]]
|13 days
|}

The difference grows by 3 days in every four centuries.  

On average, 48,700 Gregorian years and 48,699 Julian years each equal 17,787,309.75 days.  Any 194,800 consecutive Gregorian years and any consecutive 194,796 Julian years each have exactly 71,149,239 days.  Approximately every 487 centuries, there is a period during which the difference between the calendars is approximately an integral number of years and the day of the year can be the same on both calendars.  Every fourth one of these is a period that occurs exactly every 71,149,239 days (194,800 Gregorian years or 194,796 Julian years) and lasts 36,524 days (100 years on Gregorian calendar, and 99 years, 365 days on the Julian calendar), during which the difference between the calendars is an integral multiple of 1,461 days (four years) and the month and day of the month (but not the year) are the same on both calendars for the entire period.  The remainder are periods of several centuries each, during which the day of the year coincides for approximately 25–75% of the months in each century.

==Beginning of the year==

Contrary to popular opinion, the Gregorian calendar did not move the beginning of the year to [[1 January]]. Already the ancient Romans had begun their years on [[1 January]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] [[1 January]] was given the name ''[[New Year's Day]]'' (or an equivalent name) {{Fact|date=February 2007}} in all [[Western Europe]]an countries, even while many of those countries began their numbered year either on [[25 December]] (the [[Nativity of Jesus]]), [[1 March]], [[25 March]] (the [[Annunciation]]), or even [[Easter]]. The term ''New Year's Day'' was the result of always displaying the months of the medieval calendar from January to December (in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each), just like the Romans did. 

Furthermore, all Western European countries (except for a few [[Italy|Italian]] states) shifted the first day of their numbered year to [[1 January]] while they were still using the Julian calendar, ''before'' they adopted the Gregorian calendar, many during the sixteenth century. Eastern European countries (most of them with populations showing allegiance to the [[orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]]) began their numbered year on [[1 September]] (since about [[988]]).

Neither the papal bull nor its attached canons explicitly fix such a date, though it is implied by two tables of [[saint]]'s days, one labeled 1582 which ends on [[31 December]], and another for any full year that begins on [[1 January]]. It also specifies its [[epact]] relative to [[1 January]], in contrast with the Julian calendar, which specified it relative to [[22 March]]. These would have been the inevitable result of the above shift in the beginning of the Julian year.

During the period between 1582, when the first countries adopted the Gregorian calendar, and 1923, when the last European country adopted it, it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the Julian calendar and in the Gregorian calendar, for example, "10/21&nbsp;February 1751/52", where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on [[1 January]] while others were still using some other date. Even before 1582, the year sometimes had to be double dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries. Woolley, writing in his biography of [[John Dee]] (1527-1608/9), notes that immediately after 1582 English letter writers "customarily" used "two dates" on their letters, one OS and one NS.<ref>Benjamin Woolley, ''The Queen's Conjurer: The science and magic of Dr. John Dee, adviser to Queen Elizabeth I'' (New York: Henry Holt, 2001) p.173</ref>

==Months of the year==
English speakers sometimes remember the number of days in each month by the use of the traditional [[mnemonic]] verse:<ref>[http://www.leapzine.com/30Days.htm The Month Poem]</ref> 

:''Thirty days hath September,''
:''April, June, and November.''
:''All the rest have thirty-one,''
:''excepting February alone,''
:''which hath twenty-eight.''
:''Leap year cometh one year in four,''
:''in which February hath one day more.''

(The ''hath'' in the first line of the poem is also given as ''has'' or ''have''.)

Alternate endings include:

:''excepting February alone,''
:''which has twenty-eight days or,''
:''in a leap year, adds one more.''

:''which has but twenty-eight, in fine,''
:''till leap year gives it twenty-nine.''

:''which has eight and a score,''
:''until leap year gives it one day more.''

:''which hath twenty-eight days clear,''
:''and twenty-nine in each leap year.''

:''in each leap we assign,''
:''February twenty-nine.'' 

:''When short February's done,''
:''all the rest have thirty-one.''

:''(except February,)''
:''February alone don't hold the line,''
:''for three years it has twenty-eight,''
:''and the fourth year twenty-nine.''

:''but February, it is done''
:''at twenty-eight, but add one more''
:''whenever the year divides by four.''

A shorter, satirical modern alternate ending is:
:''but silly old February spoils the fun.''

A language-independent alternative used in many countries is to hold up your two fists with the index knuckle of your left hand against the index knuckle of your right hand. Then, starting with January from the little knuckle of your left hand, count knuckle, space, knuckle, space through the months. A knuckle represents a month of 31 days, and a space represents a short month (a 28- or 29-day February or any 30-day month). The junction between the hands is not counted, so the two index knuckles represent July and August. This method also works by starting the sequence on the right hand's little knuckle, and continue toward to the left. You can also use just one hand; after counting the fourth knuckle as July, start again counting the first knuckle as August. A similar mnemonic can be found on a [[musical keyboard|piano keyboard]]: starting on the key F for January, moving up the keyboard in [[semitone]]s, the black notes give the short months, the white notes the long ones. 

The Origins of English naming used by the Gregorian calendar:
* January: [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] (Roman god of gates, doorways, beginnings and endings)
* February: [[Februus]] ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] god of death)  Februarius (mensis) (Latin for "month of purification (rituals)" it is said to be a Sabine word, the last month of ancient pre-450 BC Roman calendar)
* March: [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (Roman god of war)
* April: Aprilis (mensis) (Latin for "month of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]," second month of ancient Roman calendar)
* May: [[Maia Maiestas]] (Roman goddess)
* June: [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Roman goddess, wife of Jupiter)
* July: [[Julius Caesar]] (Roman dictator)
* August: [[Augustus]] (first Roman emperor)
* September: septem (Latin for seven, the seventh month in the calendar of [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]])
* October: octo (Latin for eight, the eighth month in the calendar of Romulus)
* November: novem (Latin for nine, the ninth month in the calendar of Romulus)
* December: decem (Latin for ten, the tenth month in the calendar of Romulus)

==Week==
{{main|Days of the week}}
In conjunction with the system of months there is a system of [[week]]s.  A physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the [[weekday]], and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month. [[Calculating the day of the week]] is not very simple, because of the irregularities in the Gregorian system.  When the Gregorian calendar was introduced, the week cycle was continued unbroken.  So Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October.

The [[ISO week date]] connects Gregorian years and weeks, defining a [[leap week calendar]] with so-called "ISO years" deviating at the beginning and end up to 3 days from Gregorian years, and with week numbers by year.

Origins of English week day names used by the Gregorian Calendar:

* Sunday - [[sun]] day (celestial), a modernization of "Sunnendaeg"
* Monday - [[moon]] day (celestial), a modernization of "Monnendaeg"
* Tuesday - [[Tyr]]'s day (Old Norse god - Tiw in Old English, Teiw in Proto-Germanic)
* Wednesday - [[Woden]]'s day (Old English god - Norse [[Odin]], German [[Wotan]])
* Thursday - [[Thor]]'s day (Old Norse god)
* Friday - [[Frigg]]'s day (Old Norse goddess) (Friday is often erroneously associated with [[Freyja]])
* Saturday - [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]'s day (Roman god)

===Distribution of dates by day of the week===
Since the 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar consists of a whole number of weeks, each cycle has a fixed distribution of weekdays among calendar dates.  It then becomes possible that this distribution is not even.

Indeed, because there are 97 leap years in every 400 years in the Gregorian Calendar, there are on average 13{{frac|6|7}} for each starting weekday in each cycle. This already shows that the frequency is not the same for each weekday, which is due to the effects of the "common" centennial years (1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 etc.).

The absence of an extra day in such years causes the following leap year (1704, 1804, 1904, 2104 etc.) to ''start on the same day of the week as the leap year twelve years before'' (1692, 1792, 1892, 2092 etc.). Similarly, the leap year eight years after a "common" centennial year (1708, 1808, 1908, 2108 etc.) starts on the same day of the week as the leap year ''immediately prior to the "common" centennial year'' (1696, 1796, 1896, 2096 etc.). Thus, those days of the week on which such leap years begin gain an extra year or two in each cycle. In each cycle there are:

* '''13'''  [[leap year starting on Monday|leap years starting on Monday]]
* '''14''' [[leap year starting on Tuesday|leap years starting on Tuesday]]
* '''14''' [[leap year starting on Wednesday|leap years starting on Wednesday]]
* '''13'''  [[leap year starting on Thursday|leap years starting on Thursday]]
* '''15''' [[leap year starting on Friday|leap years starting on Friday]]
* '''13''' [[leap year starting on Saturday|leap years starting on Saturday]]
* '''15''' [[leap year starting on Sunday|leap years starting on Sunday]]

Note that as a cycle, this pattern is symmetric with respect to the low Saturday value.

A leap year starting on Sunday means the next year does not start on Monday, so more leap years starting on Sunday means fewer years starting on Monday, etc. Thus the pattern of number of years starting on each day is inverted and shifted by one weekday: 56, 58, 57, 57, 58, 56, 58 (symmetric with respect to the high Sunday value).

The number of common years starting on each day is found by subtraction: 43, 44, 43, 44, 43, 43, 43.

The frequency of a particular date being on a particular weekday can easily be derived from the above (for dates in March and later, relate them to the ''next'' New Year).

See also [[Doomsday (weekday)#Cycle|the cycle of Doomsdays]].

==Accuracy==
The Gregorian calendar improves the approximation made by the [[Julian calendar]] by skipping three Julian leap days in every 400 years, giving an average year of 365.2425 [[solar time|mean solar day]]s long, which has an error of about one [[day]] per 3300 [[year]]s with respect to the [[mean tropical year]] of 365.24219 days but less than half this error with respect to the [[vernal equinox year]] of 365.24237 days. Both are substantially more accurate than the one day in 128 years error of the Julian calendar (average year 365.25 days).

In the 19th century, Sir [[John Herschel]] proposed a modification to the Gregorian calendar with 969 leap days per 4000 years, instead of 97 leap days per 400 years, thus reducing the average year to 365.24225 days. However, Herschel's proposal was never accepted.

On timescales of thousands of years, the Gregorian calendar falls behind the seasons drastically because the slowing down of the Earth's rotation makes each day slightly longer over time (see [[tidal acceleration]] and [[leap second]]) while the year maintains a more uniform duration. The equinox will occur earlier than now by a number of days approximately equal to [years into future/5000]<sup>2</sup>. This is a problem that the Gregorian calendar shares with any rule-based calendar with a fixed cycle.

===Calendar seasonal error===
[[Image:Gregoriancalendarleap.png|nome|640px|Gregorian calendar seasons difference]]

This image shows the difference between the Gregorian calendar and the seasons.

The ''y''-axis is "days error" and the ''x''-axis is Gregorian calendar years.

Each point represents a single date on a given year. The error shifts by about a quarter of a day per year. Years that are multiples of 100 but not 400 are ''not'' leap years. This causes a correction on years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300.

For instance, these corrections cause [[23 December]] [[1903]] to be the latest December solstice, and [[20 December]] [[2096]] to be the earliest solstice&mdash;2.25 days of variation compared with the seasonal event.

==Numerical facts==
When leap years and common years are taken into account, there are a total of 14 possible Gregorian calendars.

When different dates of Easter are also taken into account, there are a total of 70 possible Gregorian calendars.

An average year is 365.2425 days = 52.1775 weeks = 8,765.82 hours = 525,949.2 minutes = 31,556,952 seconds. All these numbers are exact, apart from leap seconds.

A common year is 365 days = 8,760 hours = 525,600 minutes = 31,536,000 seconds.

A leap year is 366 days = 8,784 hours = 527,040 minutes = 31,622,400 seconds.

Since 1971, some years may also contain one or more [[leap second]]s, to account for cumulative irregularities in the Earth's rotation. So far, these have always been positive and have occurred on average once every 18 months.

The day of the year is somewhat inconvenient to compute, not in the least because of the leap day somewhere in the middle; but the calendar has this repeating pattern for the months March through July and August through December: 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 days, totalling 153 days.  In fact, any 5 consecutive months not containing February, count 153 days.  [[153 (number)|153]] happens to be the 17th [[triangular number]], and the sum of the first 5 [[factorial]]s (among other numerical trivia).

See also [[common year starting on Sunday]] and [[dominical letter]].

The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has 146,097 days and hence exactly 20,871 weeks. So, for example, the days of the week in Gregorian 1603 were exactly the same as for 2003.  The years that are divisible by 400 begin on a Saturday.  In the 400-year cycle, more months begin on a Sunday (and hence have [[Friday 13]]) than any other day of the week (see above under [[#Week]] for a more detailed explanation of how this happens). 688 out of every 4800 months (or 172/1200) begin on a Sunday, while only 684 out of every 4800 months (171/1200) begin on each of Saturday and Monday, the least common cases.

A smaller cycle is 28 years (1,461 weeks), provided that there is no dropped leap year in between. Days of the week in years may also repeat after 6, 11, 12, 28 or 40 years. Intervals of 6 and 11 are only possible with common years, while intervals of 28 and 40 are only possible with leap years. An interval of 12 years only occurs with common years when there is a dropped leap year in between.

The [[Doomsday algorithm]] is a method by which you can discern which of the 14 calendar variations should be used in any given year (after the Gregorian reformation). It is based on the last day in February, referred to as the Doomsday.

The Gregorian serial date, also called Rata Die, is the number of days from [[January 1]], [[1]] [[A.D.]] (counting that day as day 1). For  {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the serial date is '''{{Gregorian serial date}}'''. It is  678576 more than the Modified [[Julian date]], and 1721425 less than the Julian date {{#expr:{{CURRENTJULIANDAY}} round 0}}.

==Trivia==
The [[Roman calendar]] was modified by [[Julius Caesar]] when he occupied the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]] and the [[Julian calendar]] was subsequently modified by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], who, as pope, also held the title Pontifex Maximus.

Non-leap years always begin and end on the same day of the week, since 364 (365 - 1) is a multiple of 7, the number of days in a week. For example, 2003 began on a Wednesday and ended on a Wednesday. Leap years end on the next day of the week from which they begin. For example, 2004 began on a Thursday and ended on a Friday. 

Not counting leap years, any calendar date will move to the next day of the week the following year. For example, if your birthday fell on a Tuesday in 2002, it fell on a Wednesday in 2003. Leap years make things a little more complicated. 2004 was a leap year, so calendar days of March 1 or later in the year, moved two days of the week from 2003. However, calendar days occurring before [[March 1]] do not make the extra day of the week jump until the year following a leap year. So, if your birthday is [[June 15]], then it must have fallen on a Sunday in 2003 and a Tuesday in 2004. If, however, your birthday is [[February 15]], then it must have fallen on a Saturday in 2003, a Sunday in 2004 and a Tuesday in 2005. 

In any year (even a leap year), July always begins on the same day of the week that April does. Therefore, the only difference between a July calendar page and an April calendar page in the same year is the extra day July has. The same relationship exists between September and December as well as between March and November. Add an extra day to the September page and you've got December. Take a day away from the March page and you've got November. In non-leap years only, there are additional matches: October duplicates January, and March and November duplicate February in their first 28 days. In leap years only, there is a different set of additional matches:  July is a duplicate of January while February is duplicated in the first 29 days of August.

[[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] died on the night from [[4 October]] to [[15 October]] [[1582]], that is, exactly when Spain and the Catholic world switched to the Gregorian calendar.
