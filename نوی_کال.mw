==Historical dates for the new year==
The ancient [[Roman calendar]] had only ten [[month]]s and started the year on [[1 March]], which is still reflected in the names of some months which derive from [[Latin]]: [[September]] (seventh), [[October]] (eighth), [[November]] (ninth), [[December]] (tenth). Around [[713 BC]] the months of [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year, traditionally by the second king, [[Numa Pompilius]], along with the leap month [[Mercedonius|Intercalaris]]. The year used in dates was the consular year, which began on the day when consuls first entered office &mdash; fixed by law at [[15 March]] in [[222 BC]][http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.html], but this event was moved to [[1 January]] in [[153 BC]]. In 45 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] introduced the [[Julian calendar]], dropping Intercalaris; however, [[1 January]] continued to be the first day of the new year.

In the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] a number of significant feast days in the [[ecclesiastical calendar]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] came to be used as the [[Julian year (calendar)#Julian start of the year|beginning of the Julian year]]:

* In ''Christmas Style'' dating the new year started on [[25 December]]. This was used in [[Germany]] and [[England]] until the thirteenth century, and in [[Spain]] from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.

* In ''Annunciation Style'' dating the new year started on [[25 March]], the feast of the [[Annunciation]]. This was used in many parts of Europe in the Middle Ages, and was the style introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in AD [[525]]. Annunciation Style continued to be used in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] until [[January 1]] [[1752]], except [[Scotland]] which changed to ''Circumcision Style'' dating on [[1 January]] [[1600]]. The rest of Great Britain changed to ''Circumcision Style'' on the [[1 January]] preceding the conversion in Great Britain from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar on 3/[[14 September]] [[1752]]. The UK tax year still starts on [[6 April]] which is [[25 March]] + 12 days, eleven for the conversion from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar plus a dropped leap day in 1900.

* In ''Easter Style'' dating, the new year started on [[Easter]] Saturday (or sometimes on [[Good Friday]]). This was used in [[France]] from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. A disadvantage of this system was that because Easter was a [[movable feast]] the same date could occur twice in a year; the two occurrences were distinguished as "before Easter" and "after Easter".

* In ''Circumcision Style'' dating, the new year started on [[1 January]], the  [[Feast of the Circumcision]] (of [[Jesus]]).

The ancient Roman new year of [[1 March]] was used in the [[Republic of Venice]] until its destruction in 1797, and in [[Russia]] from 988 until the end of the fifteenth century. [[1 September]] was used in [[Russia]] from the end of the fifteenth century until the adoption of the [[Anno Domini|Christian era]] in 1700 (previously, Russia had counted years since the creation of the world).

Since the seventeenth century, the Roman Catholic ecclesiastic year has started on the first day of [[Advent]], the Sunday nearest to [[St. Andrew's Day]] ([[30 November]]).

Autumnal equinox day (usually [[22 September]]) is "New Year's Day" in the [[French Republican Calendar]], which was in use from 1793 to 1805.  This was ''primidi Vendemière'', the first day of the first month.

==Trivia==
The Gregorian New Year (and all other days) first arrives each year on [[Kiritimati]] (Christmas Island), the eastern-most island in the island nation of [[Kiribati]] in the central [[Pacific Ocean]].
