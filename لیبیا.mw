'''Libya''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ليبيا Lībiyā), officially the '''Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab [[Jamahiriya]]''' (الجماهيرية العربية الليبية الشعبية الإشتراكية العظمى), is a country in [[North Africa|Northern Africa]]. Bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, it is located between [[مصر]] to the east, [[سوډان]] to the southeast, [[چاډ]] and [[نايجېر]] to the south and [[الجېريا]] and [[تونېس]] to the west. Slightly larger than [[Alaska]], Libya is the fourth largest nation in Africa and the 17th largest in the world.<ref>U.N. Demographic Yearbook, ([[2003]]), [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYB2003/Table03.pdf <u>Demographic Yearbook (3) Pop., Rate of Pop. Increase, Surface Area & Density<u>], ''United Nations Statistics Division'', Accessed July 15 2006</ref> Its [[capital]] city, [[Tripoli]], is home to 1.7 million of its 5.8 million people. The three traditional sections of the country are [[Tripolitania]], the [[Fezzan]] and [[Cyrenaica]].

The name "Libya" derives from the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]] term "Lebu", referring to [[Berber]] peoples living west of the [[Nile]], and was adopted into [[Greek language|Greek]] as "Libya". In [[ancient Greece]], the term had a broader meaning, encompassing all of [[North Africa]] west of Egypt, and sometimes referring to the entire continent of [[Africa]].

{{main|History of Libya}}
Archaeological evidence indicates that from at least the eighth millennium [[BCE]], Libya's coastal plain hosted a [[Neolithic]] culture skilled in the domestication of cattle and cultivation of crops.<ref name="locberber">Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, [http://countrystudies.us/libya/4.htm <u>Early History of Libya<u>], ''U.S. Library of Congress'', Accessed July 11 2006</ref> This culture flourished for thousands of years in Libya, millennia before the domination of ancient European forces, until being displaced or absorbed by the [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Archaeological and linguistic evidence strongly suggests that the ancestors of the Berbers may have begun their migration from [[southwestern Asia]] into the country early in the third millennium BCE. The Berbers, however, never developed a sense of nationhood and have historically identified themselves in terms of their tribe, clan, and family.<ref name="locberber" />

The land now known as modern Libya was later subjected to varying degrees of unifying foreign control, with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Carthaginians]], [[Greeks]], [[Roman citizenship|Romans]], [[Vandals]], and [[Byzantines]] ruling all or parts of Libya. Although the [[Greeks]] and Romans left ruins at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[Leptis Magna]], and [[Sabratha]], little else remains today to testify to the presence of these ancient cultures. 
[[دوتنه:Theatre sabratha libya.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|Ruins of a theatre in the Roman city of [[Sabratha]].]]
The Phoenicians were the first to establish trading posts in Libya, where the merchants of [[Tyre]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]) eventually developed commercial relations with the [[Berbers|Berber tribes]] and made treaties with them to ensure their cooperation in the exploitation of raw materials.<ref>Herodotus, (c.[[430 BCE]]), [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html <u>''"The Histories"'', Book IV.42-43<u>] ''Fordham University, New York'', Accessed July 18 2006</ref> By the fifth century BCE, [[Carthage]], the greatest of the overseas Phoenician colonies, had extended its [[hegemony]] across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilization, known as [[Punic]], came into being. Punic settlements on the Libyan coast included [[Oea]] (Tripoli), Labdah (later [[Leptis Magna]]), and [[Sabratha]], in an area that came to be known collectively as Tripolis, or "Three Cities", from which Libya's modern capital [[Tripoli]] takes its name.

The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] conquered Eastern Libya, when according to tradition, emigrants from the crowded island of [[Thera]] were commanded by the oracle at [[Delphi]] to seek a new home in North Africa, where in 631 B.C. they founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].<ref>Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, [http://countrystudies.us/libya/6.htm <u>Cyrenaica and the Greeks<u>], ''U.S. Library of Congress'', Accessed July 11 2006</ref> Within 200 years of Cyrene's founding, four more important Greek cities were established in the area: [[Barce]] ([[Al Marj]]); Euhesperides (later Berenice, present-day [[Benghazi]]); [[Teuchira]] (later Arsinoe, present-day Tukrah); and [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]] (Susah), the port of Cyrene. Together with Cyrene, they were known as the Pentapolis (Five Cities). 

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] unified both regions of Libya, and for more than 400 years, [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] became prosperous Roman provinces.<ref>Heuser, Stephen, ([[July 24]], [[2005]]), [http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2005/07/24/when_romans_lived_in_libya/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Travel+News <u>"When Romans lived in Libya"<u>], ''The Boston Globe'' Accessed July 18 2006</ref> Roman ruins like those of Leptis Magna attest to the vitality of the region, where populous cities and even smaller towns enjoyed the amenities of urban life. Merchants and artisans from many parts of the Roman world established themselves in North Africa, but the character of the cities of Tripolitania remained decidedly Punic and, in Cyrenaica, Greek. 

The [[Arabs]] conquered Libya in the seventh century [[Common Era|CE]]. In the following centuries, many of the indigenous peoples adopted [[Islam]], the [[Arabic language]] and culture. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks conquered the country in the mid-16th century, Libya remaining part of their empire, although at times virtually autonomous, until [[Italy]] invaded in 1911. In the face of years of resistance, Libya was made a colony.<ref>Country Profiles, ([[May 16]], [[2006]]), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/1398437.stm <u>Timeline: Libya, a chronology of key events<u>] ''BBC News'', Accessed July 18 2006</ref>

In 1934, Italy adopted the name "Libya" (used by the Greeks for all of [[North Africa]], excepting [[Egypt]]) as the official name of the colony, which consisted of the provinces of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]], and [[Fezzan]]. [[Idris I of Libya|King Idris I]], Emir of Cyrenaica, led Libyan resistance to Italian occupation between the two World Wars. From 1943 to 1951, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were under [[Britian|British]] administration, while the [[France|French]] controlled Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [[Cairo]] but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.<ref>Hagos, Tecola W., ([[Nov 20]], [[2004]]), [http://www.tecolahagos.com/part4.htm <u>"Treaty Of Peace With Italy (1947), Evaluation And Conclusion"<u>], ''Ethiopia Tecola Hagos'', Accessed July 18 2006</ref>
[[دوتنه:Omar_Mukhtar_13.jpg|125px|thumb|left|[[Omar Mukhtar]] (1858&nbsp;– 1931), leader of the Libyan uprising against Italian occupation.]]
On [[November 21]] [[1949]], the [[UN General Assembly]] passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before [[January 1]] [[1952]]. Idris represented Libya in the subsequent UN negotiations. When Libya declared its independence on [[December 24]] [[1951]], it was the first country to achieve independence through the United Nations and one of the first European possessions in Africa to gain independence.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/mideast/timeline/text/links/event_360.html <u>"December 24, 1951: Libya declares its independence under King Idris"<u>], Global Connections - The Middle East, Accessed July 15 2006</ref> Libya was proclaimed a constitutional and hereditary [[monarchy]] under King Idris.

The discovery of significant [[oil reserves]] in 1959 and the subsequent income from [[petroleum]] sales enabled one of the world's poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state, as measured by per capita GDP. Although oil drastically improved the Libyan government's finances, popular resentment began to build over the increased concentration of the nation's wealth in the hands of King Idris and the national elite. This discontent continued to mount with the rise of [[Nasserism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] throughout North Africa and the [[Middle East]].

{{History of Libya}}

On [[September 1]] [[1969]], a small group of military officers led by then 28-year-old army officer [[Mu’ammar Abu Minyar al-Qadhafi]] staged a ''[[coup|coup d’etat]]'' against [[Idris I of Libya|King Idris]]. At the time, Idris was in Turkey for medical treatment. His nephew, Crown Prince [[Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi]], became King. It was clear that the revolutionary officers who had announced the deposition of [[Idris I of Libya|King Idris]] did not want to appease him over the instruments of state as King. The reason for this was because he complained that his power was far less than that which he had been exercising as Crown Prince on Idris's behalf. Before the end of September 1, King [[Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi]] had been formally deposed by the revolutionary army officers and put under house arrest. Meanwhile, revolutionary officers abolished the monarchy, and proclaimed the new Libyan Arab Republic. Qadhafi was, and is to this day, referred to as the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution" in government statements and the official press.<ref>U.S. Dept. of State and the CIA World Fact Book, [http://www.geographyiq.com/countries/ly/Libya_government_summary.htm <u>"Libya - Government and Political Conditions"<u>], ''Geography I.Q.'', Accessed July 14 2006</ref>

There is a dual government structure in Libya. The "revolutionary sector" comprises Revolutionary Leader Qadhafi, the Revolutionary Committees and the remaining members of the twelve person Revolutionary Command Council, which was established in 1969.<ref>U.S. Library of Congress, ([[1987]]), [http://reference.allrefer.com/country-guide-study/libya/libya90.html <u>"Government and Politics of Libya"<u>], ''Allrefer.com References'', Accessed July 14 2006</ref> The historical revolutionary leadership is not elected and cannot be voted out of office, as they are in power by virtue of their involvement in the revolution. The revolutionary sector dictates the decision-making power of the second sector, the "[[Jamahiriya]] Sector". Making up the [[legislative]] branch of government, this sector comprises Local People's Congresses in each of the 1,500 urban wards, 32 Sha’biyat People’s Congresses for the regions, and the National General People's [[Congress]]. These [[legislative bodies]] are represented by corresponding [[Executive (government)|executive bodies]] (Local People's Committees, Sha'biyat People's Committees and the National General People’s Committee/Cabinet).

Every four years the membership of the Local People's Congresses elects by acclamation both their own leadership and [[General secretary|secretaries]] for the People’s Committees, sometimes after many debates and a critical vote. The leadership of the Local People’s Congress represents the local congress at the People’s Congress of the next level and has an imperative [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]]. The members of the National General People's Congress elect the members of the National General People’s Committee (the [[Cabinet]]) by [[acclamation]] at their annual meeting. The most recent meeting, which took place in [[Sirte]] [[January 8]]–[[January 12]] [[2005]], was the 29th annual.<ref>Middle East and N. Africa, Amnesty International, Public Statement, ([[Jan 13]], [[2005]]), [http://www.amnestyusa.org/regions/middleeast/document.do?id=80256DD400782B8480256F8800682A75 <u>"Libya: Abolition of People's Court is an important step"<u>], Amnesty International USA, Accessed July 17 2006</ref>

While there is discussion regarding who will run for executive offices, only those approved by the revolutionary leadership are actually elected. The government administration is effective as long as it operates within the directives of the revolutionary leadership. The revolutionary leadership has absolute veto power despite the constitutionally established people's democracy and alleged rule of the people. The government controls both state-run and semi-autonomous media, and any articles critical of current policies have been requested and intentionally placed by the revolutionary leadership itself, for example, as a means of initiating reforms. In cases involving a violation of "these taboos", the private press, like The Tripoli Post, has been censored.

[[Political parties]] were banned by the 1972 Prohibition of Party Politics Act Number 71.<ref>Case Study: Libya, ([[2001]]), [http://poli.vub.ac.be/cbw/cbw/003020100.html <u>"Political Culture"<u>], ''Educational Module on Chemical & Biological Weapons Nonproliferation'', Accessed July 14 2006</ref> According to the Association Act of 1971, the establishment of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is allowed. As they are required to conform to the goals of the revolution, however, the number of NGOs in Libya is small in comparison with neighboring countries. [[Trade union]]s do not exist as such,<ref>Hodder, Kathryn, ([[2000]]), [http://www.socialwatch.org/en/informesTematicos/20.html <u>"Violations of Trade Union Rights"<u>], ''Social Watch Africa'', Accessed July 14 2006</ref> but numerous professional associations are integrated into the state structure as a third pillar, along with the People’s Congresses and Committees. These associations do not have the right to strike. Professional associations send delegates to the General People's Congress, where they have a representative mandate.

Libya's foreign policies have undergone much fluctuation and change since the state came into being on [[Christmas Eve]], [[1951]]. As the Kingdom of Libya, the country maintained a definitively pro-Western stance yet at the same time was recognized as belonging to the conservative traditionalist bloc in the [[League of Arab States]] (Arab League), of which it became a member in 1953. The Kingdom was in close alliance with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as well as with the [[United States]] both of which maintained military base rights in Libya. Libya also forged close ties with France, Italy, Greece, and [[Turkey]], and established full diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1955. 

Although the nation supported Arab causes, including the Moroccan and Algerian independence movements, Libya took little active part in the [[Arab-Israeli dispute]] or the tumultuous inter-Arab politics of the 1950s and the early 1960s. The Kingdom was noted for its close association with the West, while King Idris' government steered an essentially conservative course at home. 

After the 1969 [[coup d'état|coup]], Qadhafi closed American and British bases on Libyan territory and partially [[Nationalization|nationalized]] foreign oil and commercial interests in Libya. He also played a key role in promoting oil [[embargo]]es as a political weapon for challenging the West, hoping that an oil price rise and embargo in 1973 would persuade the West, especially the United States, to end support for Israel. Qadhafi rejected both Soviet [[communism]] and Western [[capitalism]] and claimed he was charting a middle course for his government. In October 1978, Gadaffi was severely criticised for his support of [[Idi Amin]] in the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. Libyan troops sent by Gadaffi aided [[Idi Amin]] in trying to annex the northern Tanzanian province of [[Kagera Region|Kagera]]. Amin, having lost the battle, fled to exile in Libya where he remained for almost a year.

The 1980s was a decade in which Libya increasingly distanced itself from the West and was accused of committing mass acts of state sponsored terrorism. When evidence of Libyan complicity was discovered in the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|Berlin discotheque terrorist bombing]] that killed two American servicemen, the United States responded by launching an [[Operation El Dorado Canyon|aerial bombing attack]] against targets near Tripoli and [[Benghazi]] in April 1986.

In 1991, two Libyan [[intelligence agent]]s were indicted by federal prosecutors in the U.S. and Scotland for their involvement in the December 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am flight 103]]. The [[UN Security Council]] demanded that Libya surrender the suspects, cooperate with the Pan Am 103 and [[UTA Flight 772|UTA 772]] investigations, pay compensation to the victims' families, and cease all support for terrorism. Libya's refusal to comply led to the approval of UNSC Resolution 748 on [[March 31]], [[1992]], imposing sanctions on the state designed to bring about Libyan compliance. Continued Libyan defiance led to further sanctions by the UN against Libya in November 1993.

In 2003, more than a decade after the sanctions were put in place, Libya began to make dramatic policy changes vis-à-vis the [[Western world]] with the open intention of pursuing a Western-Libyan [[détente]]. The Libyan government announced its decision to abandon its [[weapons of mass destruction]] programs and pay almost 3 billion US dollars in compensation to the families of Pan Am flight 103 as well as UTA Flight 772.<ref>Marcus, Jonathan, ([[May 15]], [[2006]]), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4774305.stm <u>"Washington's Libyan fairy tale"<u>], ''BBC News'', Accessed July 15 2006</ref> The decision was welcomed by many western nations and was seen as an important step for Libya toward rejoining the international community.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3566545.stm (March 25 2004), "Blair hails new Libyan relations" BBC news] accessed July 15 2006</ref> Since 2003 the country has normalised its ties with the [[European Union]] and the United States and has even coined the catchphrase, 'The Libya Model', an example intended to show the world what can be achieved through negotiation rather than force when there is goodwill on both sides.<ref>[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article13086.htm Michael Hirsh, (May 11 2006), "The Real Libya Model", Newsweek] Accessed July 15 2006</ref>

Libya extends over 1,759,540 square kilometres (679,182&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), making it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|17th largest nation in the world]]. It is bound to the west by [[Tunisia]] and Algeria, the southwest by [[Niger]], the south by [[Chad]] and [[Sudan]] and to the east by [[Egypt]]. Also, the country is bound to the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. At 1770 kilometres (1100 mi), Libya has the longest coastline of any country bordering the Mediterranean.<ref> [http://www.educationlibya.org/country_profile.htm Education Libya, 2005 Demographics] Accessed [[June 29]] [[2006]] </ref> The climate is mostly dry and desert-like in nature. However, the northern regions enjoy a milder [[Mediterranean climate]].

The traditional geographic regions are [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]], and [[Fezzan]]. The chief cities are the capital [[Tripoli]] in northwest Libya and [[Benghazi]], located in the east. Other significant cities include Misratah, Sirte and Sabha.<ref>[http://en.ljbc.net/lypop2004.htm 2004 Census of Libya, The national authority for information and authentication] Accessed July 17 2006</ref>

Natural hazards come in the form of hot, dry, dust-laden [[sirocco]] (known in Libya as the ''gibli''). This is a southern wind blowing from one to four days in spring and autumn. There are also [[dust storms]] and [[sandstorms]]. [[Oases]] can also be found scattered throughout Libya, the most important of which are [[Ghadames]] and [[Kufra]] as well as others.

The [[Libyan Desert]], which covers much of eastern Libya, is one of the most arid places on earth. In places, decades may pass without [[rain]], and even in the [[highlands]] rainfall happens erratically, once every 5-10 years. At Uweinat, the last recorded [[rainfall]] was in September 1998.<ref>[http://www.fjexpeditions.com/frameset/florafauna.htm Flora and Fauna of the Libyan Desert, Fliegel Jezerniczky] Accessed July 14 2006</ref> There is a large [[Depression (geology)|depression]], the [[Qattara Depression]], just to the south of the northernmost scarp, with Siwa oasis at its western extremity.

[[دوتنه:Jabal Al Akdhar.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jabal Al Akdhar]] near Benghazi is Libya's wettest region. Annual rainfall averages at between 400 and 600 millimeters.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/libya/36.htm U.S. Library of Congress, Climate of Libya] Accessed July 15 2006</ref>]]

Likewise, the temperature in the Libyan desert can be extreme; in 1922, the town of [[Al 'Aziziyah]], which is located west of [[Tripoli]], recorded an air temperature of 57.8°[[Celsius|C]] (136.0°[[Fahrenheit|F]]), generally accepted as the highest recorded naturally occurring air temperature reached on Earth.<ref>[http://www.extremescience.com/hottest.htm El Azizia Libya, "How Hot is Hot?", Extreme Science] Accessed July 14 2006</ref>

[[دوتنه:Libyan Mountains.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dramatic eroded mountains in the south of the country.]]

There are a few scattered uninhabited small oases, usually linked to the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebiana and Kufra. Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted by a series of [[plateaus]] and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan Borders. 

The Gilf Kebir plateau rises about 300 metres (1,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above the general plain, and lies entirely in Egypt. It roughly equals [[Switzerland]] in size, and is similar in structure to the other sandstone plateaus of the central [[Sahara]]. [[دوتنه:Libyan Dessert.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Desert landscape in Southern Libya.]] Its south-eastern part is well defined on all sides, with sheer cliffs and deep, narrows [[wadis]]. The northeast part, separated from the other half by a broad valley called the "Gap" is more broken, and supports three large wadis with [[vegetation]].<ref>[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/gilfkebir1.htm Allan Watson, "The Gilf Kebir, Part I", (August 19 2005) Tour Egypt] Accessed July 17 2006</ref>

Slightly further to the south are the massifs of Arkenu, Uweinat and Kissu. These [[granite]] mountains are very ancient, having formed much before the sandstones surrounding them. Arkenu and Western Uweinat are ring complexes very similar to those in the Air Mountains. Eastern Uweinat (the highest point in the Libyan Desert) is a raised sandstone plateau adjacent to the granite part further west. The plain to the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded volcanic features.

In 1996 the movie "[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]" raised public interest in the Libyan desert.

{{main|Economy of Libya}}
[[دوتنه:Modern Tripoli.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Libya's capital Tripoli has benefited much from the country's oil wealth.]]
The Libyan economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil sector, which contribute practically all [[export]] earnings and about one-quarter of [[GDP]]. These oil revenues and a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa and have allowed the Libyan state to provide an extensive and impressive level of social security, particularly in the fields of housing and education.<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/E.1990.5.Add.26.En?OpenDocument United Nations Economic & Social Council (February 16 1996), Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Report] Accessed July 14 2006</ref>  Compared to its market-orientated neighbours, Libya enjoys an extremely low level of both absolute and relative poverty.  Libyan officials in the past three years have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold.<ref>[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/ly.html CIA World Factbook 2006, Libya-Economy] Accessed July 14 2006</ref> This effort picked up steam after [[International sanctions|UN sanctions]] were lifted in September 2003 and as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs to build [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/libya/index03.html W.M.D., 2003 Libya Special Weapons News, Global Security Report] Accessed July 14 2006</ref>

[[دوتنه:Tripoli Medina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tripoli's Old City - (El-Madina El-Kadima) - situated in the city centre is one of the classical sites of the Mediterranean.]]
Libya has started to respond to international, political and economic pressure to adopt market orientated reforms and has begun liberalizing the highly effective socialist-oriented economy. Initial steps&nbsp;— including applying for [[WTO]] membership, reducing some [[subsidies]], and announcing plans for [[privatization]]&nbsp;— are laying the groundwork for a transition to a more [[market-based economy]].<ref>[http://www.tralac.org/scripts/content.php?id=2788 (July 28 2004) "Libya to start WTO membership talks", Reuters] Accessed July 16 2006</ref> The non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production of [[petrochemicals]], [[iron]], [[steel]], and [[aluminum]]. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food.<ref>[http://www.ciaworldfactbook.info/libya-economy.html CIA World Factbook, Economy of Libya 2002] Accessed July 16 2006</ref> 

The Libyan economy is also viewed as ripe for modernisation and [[foreign investment]].<ref>[http://www.exporteastofengland.org.uk/compdetails.asp?id=2759&from= U.K. Trade and Investment, Libyan Trade Links with the UK] Accessed July 14 2006</ref> Under the previous Prime Minister, [[Shukri Ghanem]] and current prime minister [[Baghdadi Mahmudi]], it is undergoing a business boom. Many socialist-era government-run industries are being privatized. UN sanctions were ended in 2003, and most US sanctions have also been lifted; as of May 2006, the remaining vestiges are scheduled for removal pending US Congressional approval. Continental Airlines currently offers code-share travel to Libya. Many international oil companies have returned to the country, including the recent return of controversial oil giants [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[ExxonMobil]].<ref>[http://www.oilandgasnewsworldwide.com/News.asp?Article=16404 "Shell returns to Libya with gas exploration pact", Volume: 23, No. 27, Oil & Gas Worldwide News 2006] Accessed July 14 2006</ref> Tourism is also on the rise which has brought demand for the building of more hotels and increasing capacity in airports such as [[Tripoli International Airport|Tripoli International]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/ads/global/libya2/five.html Libya Report Part II 2005, New York Times] Accessed July 14 2006</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Libya}}
[[دوتنه:Libyan Arabs.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Libyan Arab children.]]

Libya has a small population within its large territory, with a [[population density]] of about 3 persons per square kilometre (8.5/mi²) in the two northern regions of [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]], and less than one person per square kilometre (1.6/mi²) elsewhere. This makes Libya one of the least populous nations by area in the world.<ref>[http://www.knowledgefun.com/book/p/po/population_density.html Knowledge & Fun, List of countries and their population densities] Accessed July 14 2006</ref> 90% of the people live in less than 10% of the area, mostly along the coast. More than half the population is urban, mostly concentrated in the two largest cities, [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]].<ref>[http://apha.confex.com/apha/132am/techprogram/paper_91322.htm Mailud Al- Amari, "Population Dynamics and Fertility Trends in Libya" (November 2004)] Accessed July 17 2006</ref> Native Libyans are primarily a mixture of [[Arabs]] and [[Berbers]].

[[دوتنه:Libya ethnic groups.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A map indicating the ethnic composition of Libya.]]

Within Libya, there are also small [[Tuareg]] and [[Tebu people|Tebu]] tribal groups concentrated in the south, living [[nomadic]] or semi-nomadic lifestyles. Among foreign residents, the largest groups are citizens of other African nations, including North Africans (primarily Egyptians and Tunisians), West Africans and [[Sub-Saharan]] Africans.<ref>[http://www.columbiagazetteer.org/public/Libya.html "Libya" - Population, The Columbia Gazetteer of the World Online 2005] Accessed July 17 2006</ref> Libyan Berbers and Arabs constitute 97% of the population, the other 3% are Black Africans, [[Greeks]], [[Maltese]], [[Italians]], [[Egyptian people|Egyptians]], [[Pakistanis]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[India]]ns and Tunisians.

The main language spoken in Libya is [[Arabic]], which is also the official language. [[Tamazight]] (Berber languages), which do not have official status, are spoken by Libyan Berbers.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/text_761570705__1/Libya.html Lisa Anderson, "Libya", III. People, B. Religion & Language, MSN Encarta 2006] Accessed July 17 2006</ref> [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]] are sometimes spoken in the big cities, although Italian speakers are mainly among the older generation. In addition, Tuaregs have their own language which belongs to the Berber languages group.

{{main|Culture of Libya}}
[[دوتنه:Benghazi_coast.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Coastline of Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. With the longest coastline of any Mediterranean nation, Libya's mostly unspoilt beaches are a common place for socialising for many Libyans.]]
Libyan culture is, to a certain extent, similar to that of its other neighbouring [[Arab]] states. The Libyan people very much consider themselves as part of a wider Arab community. The primary language is a [[Libyan Arabic|colloquial form of Arabic]] that is unique to the area around Libya.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayl "Arabic Libyan", Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition (2005).] Accessed July 17 2006</ref> There seem to be two distinct [[dialects]] and a couple of village and tribal dialects. Libyan Arabs have a heritage in the traditions of the nomadic [[Bedouin]] and associate themselves with a particular Bedouin tribe.

Family life is important for Libyan families, the majority of whom live in [[Tower block|apartment blocks]] and various kinds of independent housing units depending on their income status. Most of the Arabs, who have lived [[nomadic]] lifestyles, traditionally in tents, have been settled in various towns and cities in Libya. Because of this, their old ways of life are fading out. It is believed that there are still some who do live as they have for centuries in the desert, though no one knows the exact numbers. Most of the population are engaged in occupations in [[industry]] and [[services]], and a small percentage is in [[agriculture]].

Similar to some other countries in the [[Arab world]], Libya boasts few theatres or art galleries. Public entertainment is almost non-existent, even in the big cities. Instead, most Libyans enjoy regular trips to the many beaches of the country. They also visit Libya's many beautifully preserved archaeological sites, especially [[Leptis Magna]], which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archaeological sites in the world.

The nation's capital [[Tripoli]] boasts many good museums and archives including the Government Library, the Ethnographic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, the National Archives, the Epigraphy Museum and the Islamic Museum. The Jamahirirya Museum, built in consultation with [[UNESCO]], is possibly the country's most famous and houses one of the finest collections of classical art in the Mediterranean.

There has recently been something of a revival of the arts in Libya, especially in the field of painting and private galleries are springing up to provide a showcase for new talent.<ref>[http://www.discoverlibyatravel.com/ "Libya Today", Discover Libya] Accessed July 14 2006</ref> Conversely, for many years there have been no public theatres and only a few cinemas showing foreign films. The tradition of [[folk culture]] is still alive and well, with troupes performing music and dance at frequent festivals, both in Libya and abroad. The main output of Libyan television is devoted to showing various styles of traditional Libyan music. Traditional [[Tuareg music]] and dance are popular in Ghadames and the south.

== مذهب ==
{{main|Islam in Libya}}
[[دوتنه:Ghadames Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mosque in [[Ghadames]], close to the Tunisian and Algerian border. 97% of Libyans are followers of Islam.]]
By far the predominant religion in Libya is [[Islam]] with 97% of the population associating with the Muslim faith.<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/adhloc/Wh_185.html Religious adherents by location, "42,000 religious geography and religion statistics", Libya] Accessed July 15 2006</ref> Nearly all Libyan Muslims adhere to the Sunni sect of Islam, which provides both a spiritual guide for individuals and a keystone for government policy. 

Before the 1930s, the Sanusi Movement was the primary Islamic movement in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its zawaayaa (lodges) were found in Tripolitania and Fezzan, but Sanusi influence was strongest in Cyrenaica. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Sanusi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose. This Islamic movement, which was later destroyed by both [[Italo-Turkish War|Italian invasion]] and later the Qadhafi government, was very conservative and somewhat different to the Islam that exists in Libya today. Qadhafi himself is a devout Muslim, and his government is taking somewhat of a leading role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytizing on behalf of Islam. Libyan Islam, however, has always been considered as traditional but in no way harsh. A Libyan form of [[Sufism]] is also somewhat common in parts of the country.

Although Libyans are overwhelmingly [[Sunni Muslim]]s, there are also very small [[Christian]] communities, composed exclusively of foreigners. There is a small [[Anglican]] community, made up mostly of African immigrant workers in Tripoli, which is part of the Egyptian Diocese. There are also an estimated 40,000 [[Roman Catholics]] in Libya who are served by two Bishops, one in Tripoli (serving the Italian community) and one in Benghazi (serving the [[Maltese]] community).

Libya was once the home of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to at least 300 BC.<ref>[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html The World Jewish Congress, "History of the Jewish Community in Libya"] Accessed July 16 2006</ref> A series of pogroms started in November of 1945 lasting for almost three years, drastically reducing Libya's Jewish population.<ref name="harris">Harris, David A. (2001), In the Trenches: Selected Speeches and Writings of an American Jewish Activist, 1979-1999, pp. 149-150</ref> In 1948, about 38,000 Jews lived in the country.  

Upon Libya's independence in [[1951]], most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya.  Another series of [[pogrom]]s began after the [[Suez Crisis]] in [[1956]], forcing all but about 100 Jews to flee.  When Muammar al-Qaddafi came to power, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews were cancelled. Although the main synagogue in Tripoli was renovated in [[1999]], it has yet to re-open for services.
