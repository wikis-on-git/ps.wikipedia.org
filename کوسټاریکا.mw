The '''Republic of Costa Rica''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República de Costa Rica'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[re'puβlika ðe 'kosta 'rika]}}) is a country in [[Central America]], bordered by [[نيکاراګوا]] to the north, [[پاناما]] to the south-southeast, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and south, and the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the east.  Costa Rica was the first country in the world to constitutionally [[Military of Costa Rica|abolish its army]]. 
== History of Costa Rica ==
{{main|History of Costa Rica}}
In [[Pre-Columbian]] times the [[Native American (Americas)|Native Americans]] in what is now [[Costa Rica]] were part of the [[Intermediate Area]] located between the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean]] cultural regions.  This has recently been redefined to include the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] area, defined by the presence of groups that spoke [[Chibchan languages]]. These groups are also believed to have created the [[Stone spheres of Costa Rica]], between [[200 BC]] and AD [[1600]].

[[دوتنه:NicoyaCeramics.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Pre-Columbian Ceramics from Nicoya, Costa Rica]]The native people of the [[Mayans]] and [[Aztecs]] were conquered by [[Spain]] in the [[16th century]]. Costa Rica was then the southernmost province in the Spanish territory of [[New Spain]]. The provincial capital was in [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]]. 

After briefly joining the Mexican Empire of [[Agustín de Iturbide]] (''see:'' [[History of Mexico]] and [[Mexican Empire]]), Costa Rica became a state in the [[United Provinces of Central America]] (''see:'' [[History of Central America]]) from [[1823]] to [[1839]]. In [[1824]], the capital moved to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. From the [[1840s]] on, Costa Rica was an independent nation.

Costa Rica has avoided the violence that has plagued Central America; it is seen as an example of political stability in the region, and is referred to as the "[[Switzerland]] of the [[Americas]]". Since the late [[19th century]] only two brief periods of violence have marred its democratic development. In [[1949]], [[José Figueres Ferrer]] abolished the [[army]]; and since then Costa Rica has been one of the few countries to operate within the democratic system without the assistance of a military. 

Costa Rica (Spanish for "Rich Coast"), although still a largely agricultural country, has achieved a relatively high standard of living. Land ownership is widespread and [[Electronics]] is a rapidly expanding industry.

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Costa Rica fishing boat.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''Rich Coast:'' fishermen set sail near Quepos, on the Pacific coast.]]

Costa Rica is located on the [[Central America]]n [[isthmus]], 10° North of the [[equator]] and 84° West of the [[Prime Meridian]]. It borders both the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] (to the west), with a total of 1,290 kilometres (802&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of coastline (212&nbsp;km / 132&nbsp;mi on the Caribbean coast and 1,016&nbsp;km / 631&nbsp;mi on the Pacific).

Costa Rica also borders [[Nicaragua]] to the north (309&nbsp;km / 192&nbsp;mi of border) and [[Panama]] to the south-southeast (639&nbsp;km / 397&nbsp;mi of border). In total, Costa Rica comprises 51,100 square kilometers (19,730 [[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), of which 50,610 square kilometers (19,540&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) is land and 440 square kilometers (170&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) is water, making it slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]] and about half the size of [[Ireland]].

The highest point in the country is [[Cerro Chirripo]], with 3,810 [[metre]]s (12,500 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), the second highest peak in Central America, after [[Volcan Tajumulco]] in [[Guatemala]]. The highest volcano in the country is the [[Irazú|Irazú Volcano]] (3,431&nbsp;m or 11,257&nbsp;ft).

Costa Rica also comprises several islands. [[Cocos Island]] stands out because of its distance from continental landmass (24&nbsp;km² or 9.25&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi, 500&nbsp;km or 310&nbsp;mi from [[Puntarenas]] coast), but [[Calero Island]] is the biggest island of the country (151.6&nbsp;km² or 58.5&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).

The largest lake in Costa Rica is [[Lake Arenal]]. The country is highly recognized and praised for its [[National Parks of Costa Rica|national park system]]: a developed and progressive system which stresses [[ecotourism]]. Costa Rica protects over 25% of its national territory within national parks.

== Politics ==

{{main|Politics of Costa Rica}}

Costa Rica is a democratic republic with a strong constitution. It is seen as one of the most stable countries in Latin America. Costa Rica has avoided the violence that has plagued Central America; it is seen as an example of political stability in the region, and is referred to as the "Switzerland of the Americas". Executive responsibilities are vested in a [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|president]], who is the country's center of power. There also are two vice presidents and a 15-member cabinet that includes one of the vice presidents. The president and 57 [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] deputies are elected for 4-year terms. A constitutional amendment approved in [[1969]] limited presidents and deputies to one term, although a deputy may run again for an Assembly seat after sitting out a term. An amendment to the constitution to allow second presidential terms was proposed and also the constitutionality of the prohibition against a second presidential term has been challenged in the courts.  In April [[2003]] the prohibition was officially recognized, in a highly polemic resolution,  as anti-constitutional allowing [[Óscar Arias]] ([[Nobel Peace Prize]], [[1987]]) to run for President a second time in the upcoming 2006 elections. Arias is a promoter of free trade and supports the free trade agreement with the United States which is the source of a great controversy that might develop in protests around the country in the upcoming months. Costa Rica uses a form of [[proportional representation]] to elect its national legislative body.

Governors appointed by the president head the country's seven provinces, but they exercise little power. There are no provincial legislatures. Autonomous state agencies enjoy considerable operational independence; they include the telecommunications and electrical power monopoly, the nationalized commercial banks, the state insurance monopoly, and the social security agency. Costa Rica has no military by constitution but maintains domestic Police and armed National Guard forces for internal security.

== Provinces ==
{{main|Provinces of Costa Rica}}
[[دوتنه:Costa Rica provinces.png|thumb|Provinces of Costa Rica]]

Costa Rica consists of six provinces:

# 
# [[Alajuela Province|Alajuela]] (central; north of capital [[San Jose, Costa Rica|San José]], agriculture and industrial manufacturing)
# [[Cartago Province|Cartago]] (former Costa Rican Provicial capital during colonial times)
# [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]] (north-west, important touristic and agricultural area)
# [[Heredia Province|Heredia]] (central; north of capital, manufacturing and core of Costa Rica's IT industry)
# [[Limón Province|Limón]] (caribbean coast, agricultural and eco-tourism area)
# [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]] (along most of the Pacific coast, with a large bulge in the south-west and a smaller one at the northern end at both sides of the [[Golfo de Nicoya]], where the homonymous capital is located)
#[[San José Province|San José]] (Capital) (political and economical center of Costa Rica, see image below)

[[دوتنه:Downtown_San_Jose.jpg|thumb|Downtown San José]]

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Costa Rica}}

[[Costa Rica]]'s economy was based on [[agriculture]] (coffee, bananas, pineapples, ornamentals), but in recent times [[ecotourism]], [[electronics]],pharmaceutics, financial outsourcing and software development  are in the actuality the main sources of business. Costa Rica's location in the [[Central America]]n [[isthmus]] provides easy access to American markets as it has the same time zone as the central part of the United States and direct ocean access to Europe and Asia. 

The economy has been expanding for Costa Rica in part because the Government had implemented a seven year plan of expansion in the high tech industry.  The central government offers tax exemptions for those who are willing to invest in the country. High levels of education among its residents make the country an attractive investing location.  Several global high tech corporations have already started developing in the area exporting goods including chip manufacturer Intel and pharmaceutical companies such as Procter & Gamble and Glaxo Smith Kline. Trade with South East Asia and Russia has boomed during 2004 and 2005, and the country is expected to obtain full Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) membership by 2007 (the country became an observer in 2004).
 
For the fiscal year 2005 the country showed a government deficit of 2.1%, internal revenue increased an 18%, exports increased a 12.8% and the number of visiting tourists increased a 19%, reaching 1.5 million people. Economic growth stood at 4.2%, nevertheless the country faced high inflation (14%) and a trade deficit of 5.2%.  

The unit of [[currency]] is the [[Costa Rican colón|colón]] ([[CRC]]), which trades around 500 to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]; currently about 600 to the [[euro]].

== Foreign affairs ==
While Costa Rica is not expected to join the tide of new left-leaning governments in Latin America, its foreign policy does not always line up with the interests of the USA. Costa Rica is a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] and rejected U.S. offers to set up a security training center in the country on the grounds that a country with no army could not harbor a center with possible military purposes. The U.S. instead set up such a center in [[El Salvador]], a country alleged to have a tradition of human rights equivocacy. 

Costa Rica has no embassy in [[Cuba]], but does have an embassy in [[Israel]], and has diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan, not the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

Costa Rica is currently a member of the [[Cairns Group]], an alliance of countries opposed to agricultural subsidies in the first world.

Costa Rica's main foreign policy objective is to foster human rights and sustainable development as a way to secure stability and growth. Nevertheless, economic pragmatism may prevail over ideology. For instance, during the [[Cold War]] Costa Rica was the first Central American country to have diplomatic ties with the [[Soviet Union]] as a way to boost its [[coffee]] exports, to the dismay of the [[Nixon]] administration.

== Flora and Fauna ==
[[دوتنه:Anhinga b.jpg|left|thumb|[[Anhinga]] drying its feathers]]

Costa Rica is home to a rich variety of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.  While the country has only about 0.1% of the world's land mass, it contains 5% of the world's [[biodiversity]].  As Costa Rica has no [[military]] or [[navy]], but an abundance of [[wildlife]], it has been said that the [[soldiers]] are the leaf cutter [[ant]]s, the [[aviator|pilots]] are the [[macaw]]s and the navy ships are the [[whale]]s. Over 25% of Costa Rica is composed of protected [[forest]]s and reserves. 

One national park that is internationally renowned among [[ecology|ecologists]] for its biodiversity (including big cats and [[tapirs]]) and where visitors can expect to see an abundance of wildlife is the [[Corcovado National Park]].

Tortuguero National Park (the name ''Tortuguero'' can be translated as turtle catcher or turtle hunter) is home to [[spider monkey|spider]], [[howler monkey|howler]] and [[White-throated Capuchin]] monkeys, the [[Three-toed sloth]], 320 species of birds (including eight species of [[parrot]]s), a variety of [[reptile]]s, but is mostly recognized for the annual nesting of the endangered green turtle. is considered the most important nesting site for this species. Giant leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead turtles also nest here.
 
The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve hosts 2,000 plant species including numerous [[orchid]]s. Over 400 types of [[birds]] can be found here, as well as over 100 species of [[mammal]]s. Costa Rica as a whole has about 600 species of birds. The entity entrusted to do genetic and biochemical prospection on Costa Rica's biological wealth is the INBIO (Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad), and it is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance.

{{main|Demographics of Costa Rica}}

In 2005, Costa Rica had a estimated population of 4,016,173 persons. The majority of people in Costa Rica are [[mestizo]] (mixed [[European]] and [[Amerindian]]) to various degrees, though the Spanish element often predominates an most simply consider themselves [[White people|white]]. There is also a large unmixed European minority (primarily Spanish). Together, mestizos and whites account for a combined 94% of the population. Some 3% of the population is of black African descent, and are mostly English-speaking descendants of 19th-century black [[Jamaican]] immigrant workers. Another 1% is composed of [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]]. 

The indigenous population today numbers less than 1%, or around 29,000 individuals. In [[Guanacaste Province]], a significant portion of the population descends from a mix of the [[Chorotega]] Amerindians, [[Bantu]] Africans and Spaniards. There is also a small [[expat]] community of [[Americans|American]] and [[Canadians|Canadian]] retirees.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Costa Rica}}
The locals refer to themselves as ''[[tico]]'', maje or ''mae'' (sort of "man", actually ''maje'' means "dumb") idiom in a very popular and "only with close friends" way, or ''tica'' (female).  "Tico" comes from the locally popular usage of "tico" diminutive suffixes (eg. 'momentico' instead of 'momentito'). The ''tico'' ideal is that of a very friendly, helpful, laid back, unhurried, educated and environmentally aware people, with little worry for deadlines or the "normal" stresses of United States life.  Visitors from the United States are often referred to as ''gringos'', which is virtually always congenial in nature.  The phrase "Pura Vida" (literally pure life) is a motto ubiquitous in Costa Rica. It encapsulates the pervading ideology of living in peace in a calm, unflustered manner, appreciating a life surrounded by nature and family and friends. 

Costa Rican traditions and culture tend to retain a strong degree of Spanish influence. Their spoken accent is rather closer to certain areas of Colombia than its Central American counterparts. Costa Rica boasts a varied history. Costa Rica was the point where the Mesoamerican and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, Nicoya, was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the 16th century. The center and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. However, the indigenous people have influenced modern Costa Rican culture to a relatively small degree, as most of the Indians died from disease and mistreatment by the Spaniards. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries, although most Caribbean Costa Ricans of African ascent descend from Jamaican workers brought in during the 19th century to work in the construction of railways connecting the urban populations of the Central Plateau to the port of [[Limon]] on the Caribbean coast. During the 19th century Chinese and Italian immigrants came to the country to work on the construction of the railroad system as well
