The '''Republic of Burundi''' (formerly '''Urundi''') is a small country in the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] region of [[Africa]]. It is bordered by [[راوانډا]] on the north, [[تانزانيه]] on the south and east, and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on the west. Although the country is [[landlocked]], much of its western border is adjacent to [[Lake Tanganyika]]. The country's name derives from its [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language, [[Kirundi]].

Geographically isolated, facing population pressures and having sparse resources, Burundi is one of the poorest and most conflict-ridden countries in Africa and in the world. Its small size belies the magnitude of the problems it faces in reconciling the claims of the [[Tutsi]] minority with the [[Hutu]] majority.

== تاريخ==
{{main|History of Burundi}}

The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Pygmy]] peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes during [[Bantu]] [[human migration|migrations]].
Burundi existed as an independent [[List of Kings of Burundi|kingdom]] from the [[16th century]]. In [[1903]], it became a [[Germany|German]] colony and passed to [[Belgium]] in [[World War I]].  It was part of the Belgian [[League of Nations]] mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] in [[1923]], later a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory under Belgian administrative authority following [[World War II]].
The origins of Burundi monarchy are veiled in myth. According to some legends, Ntare Rushatsi, founder of the original dynasty, came to Burundi from Rwanda in 17th century; other, more reliable sources, suggest that Ntare came from Buha, in the south-east, and laid the foundation for his kingdom in the Nkoma region.

Until the downfall of the monarchy in 1966, kingship remained one of last links that bound Burundi with its past.

From independence in [[1962]], until the elections of 1993, Burundi was controlled by a series of military dictators, all from the Tutsi minority. These years saw extensive ethnic violence including major incidents in [[1964]] and the late 1980s, and the [[Burundi_genocide|Burundian genocide]] in [[1972]]. In 1993, Burundi held its first [[Burundi presidential election, 1993|democratic elections]], which were won by the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU). FRODEBU leader [[Melchior Ndadaye]] became Burundi's first Hutu President, but a few months later he was assassinated by a group of Tutsi army officers. The killing plunged Burundi into a vicious [[Burundi Civil War|civil war]].

In retaliation for Ndadaye's killing, Hutu extremists massacred hundreds of thousands of Tutsi civilians. The Tutsi-dominated army responded by massacring thousands of Hutus. Years of instability followed until 1996, when former president [[Pierre Buyoya]] took power in a coup. In August 2000, a peace-deal agreed by all but two of Burundi's political groups laid out a timetable for the restoration of democracy. After several more years of violence, a cease-fire was signed in 2003 between Buyoya's government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD. Later that year, FRODEBU leader [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] replaced Buyoya as President. Yet the most extreme Hutu group, Palipehutu-FNL (commonly known as "FNL"), continued to refuse negotiations. In August 2004, the group massacred 152 Congolese Tutsi refugees at the [[Gatumba]] refugee camp in western Burundi. In response to the attack, the Burundian government issued arrest warrants for the FNL leaders Agathon Rwasa and Pasteur Habimana, and declared the group a terrorist organisation. 

In May 2005 a cease-fire was finally agreed between the FNL and the Burundian government, but fighting continued. Renewed negotiations are now under way, amid fears that the FNL will demand a blanket amnesty in exchange for laying down their arms. A series of [[Burundi elections, 2005|elections]], held in mid-2005 were won by the former Hutu rebel [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD-FDD).

== Politics ==

{{main|Politics of Burundi}}  
The political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the [[civil war]] and a long [[peace process]] and move to [[democracy]].  The current [[President of Burundi]] is [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], a former rebel leader of the [[Hutu]] [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] who was [[Burundi elections, 2005|elected unopposed]] as the new [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President of Burundi]] by the [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] on [[19 August]] [[2005]].  Nkurunziza was the first president chosen through democratic means since the start of the [[Burundi Civil War|civil war]] in 1993 and was sworn in on [[26 August]], replacing transitional president [[Domitien Ndayizeye]].

== Administrative Divisions ==

{{main|Geography of Burundi}}

Burundi is a [[landlocked]] country with an [[equatorial climate]].  It lies on a rolling [[plateau]], with [[Lake Tanganyika]] in its south west corner.  The average elevation of the central plateau is 5,600 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]], with lower elevations at the borders.  The highest peak, [[Mount Karonje]], at 8,809 feet (2,685 [[metre|m]]), lies to the southeast of the capital, Bujumbura.  The southeastern and southern borders are at roughtly 4,500 feet (1,370&nbsp;m).  A strip of land along the [[Ruzizi River]], north of Lake Tanganyika, is the only area below 3,000 feet (915&nbsp;m): this area forms part of the [[Albertine Rift]], the western extension of the [[Great Rift Valley]].  

The land is mostly [[agricultural]] or [[pasture]], the creation of which has led to [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]] and [[habitat loss]].  There are two [[national park]]s, [[Kibira National Park]] to the northwest (a region of [[montane rainforest]], adjacent to [[Nyungwe National Park]] in Rwanda), [[Rurubu National Park]] to the north east (along the [[Rurubu River]], also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu).

The farthest headstream of the [[Nile]] is in Burundi.  Although [[Lake Victoria]] is commonly considered to be the source of the Nile, the [[Kagera River]] flows for 429 [[mile]]s (690 km) before reaching Lake Victoria.  The source of the [[Ruvyironza River]], an upper branch of the Kagera River, is at [[Mount Kikizi]] in Burundi.

Burundi is divided into 16 administrative [[Provinces of Burundi|provinces]]. The [[capital city]], [[Bujumbura]], has by far the largest population.  Smaller [[List of cities in Burundi|cities of Burundi]] include [[Gitega]], [[Muyinga]], [[Ngozi]] and [[Ruyigi]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Burundi}}

Burundi's largest industry is [[agriculture]], which accounted for 58% of GDP in 1997. [[Coffee]] is the nation's biggest revenue earner with 78% of all exported goods. Other agriculture products include [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[banana]]s, [[manioc]] (tapioca); beef, milk, and hides.  Besides agriculture, other industries include light consumer goods such as blankets, shoes, soap; assembly of imported components; public works construction; food processing.  The currency is the [[Burundian franc]] (BIF).

Burundi is the poorest country in the world, in terms of GDP per capita: [[United States dollar|US$]]106 as of [[2005]].  The economy is supported by foreign aid from Western Europe and other parts of the world. In 2000 this amount reached [[US$]]92.7 million. 68% of the population lived below the poverty line in 2002.  The country's estimated gross domestic product (GDP) was US$700 million in 2001.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Burundi}}

[[As of 2004|As of July 2004]], Burundi had an estimated population of 6,231,221, approximately half of whom are aged 14 or less.  This estimate explicitly takes into account the effects of [[AIDS]], which has a significant effect on the demographics of the country.  Roughly 85% of the population are of [[Hutu]] ethnic origin; most of the remaining population are [[Tutsi]], with a minority of [[Twa]] ([[Pygmy]]), and a few thousand Europeans and South Asians.  The population density of around 206 persons per square kilometre (534/sq.&nbsp;mi) is the second highest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], behind only Rwanda.  The Twa are thought to be the original inhabitants of the area, with Hutu and then Tutsi settlers arriving in the [[1300s]] and [[1400s]] respectively.

The largest religion is [[Roman Catholic]]ism (62%), followed by indigenous beliefs (31%) and a minority of [[Protestant]]s (5%) and [[Muslim]]s (2%).  The official languages are [[Kirundi language|Kirundi]] and [[French language|French]], although [[Swahili]] is spoken along the western border.

Recent reports indicate the Christian population may be as high as 90% with most of the remainder being Muslim. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4402974.stm]

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Burundi}}

The culture of Burundi is related to that of neighbouring countries and its prominence has been limited by the [[civil war]]. The [[Master Drummers of Burundi]] are the most famous performing group from the nation, and [[football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport.
