A very rough estimate puts the population of Wakhis between 70,000-100,000.<ref>Coates, Ken (2004). A global history of indigenous peoples: Struggle and survival. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, Isbn=1403939292</ref><ref name="West, Barbara 2008">West, Barbara (2008). Encyclopedia of the peoples of asia and oceania. Facts on File, Isbn=0816071098</ref>  The population is divided among four different countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Xinjiang]] in north-western [[China]]. In China the Wakhi are officially recognized as "[[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Tajiks]]", in Afghanistan they are officially called "[[Pamiri people|Pamiris]]", while in Tajikistan Wakhi are recognized by the state as Tajiks but also self-identify as [[Pamiri people|Pamiris]] and in [[Pakistan]] they refer to themselves as "[[Pamiri people|Pamiris]]" and [[Gojal|Guhjali]]. The major religions of Wakhis are [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]] [[Muslim]], being followers of the [[Aga Khan IV|Aga Khan]] and [[Ethnic religions]].<ref name="West, Barbara 2008" /><ref>Shahrani, M.

In Pakistan, the central organization of Wakhis is the [[Wakhi Tajik Culture Association Pakistan]] (WCA), an organization that is working with the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Government of Pakistan|Pakistani Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] and [[Lok Virsa Pakistan]]. The WCA aims to preserve the Wakhi language and culture and to record its [[poetry]] and [[music]]. The WCA has arranged more than twenty programmes since 1984, including cultural shows, musical nights, large-scale musical festivals with the collaboration of Lok Virsa Pakistan, [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture|Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (AKCSP)]], and [[Pakistan Television]]. In 2000, the WCA won a "Best Programme" organizer award in the [[Silk Road]] [[Festival]] from the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Pervez Musharraf]].

==رسنۍ==
[[Radio Pakistan]]'s [[Gilgit]] station broadcasts the Wakhi radio programme "Sadoyah Boom-e Dunyo" (the Voice of the Roof of the World).

A computerized codification of Wakhi script has been released. It is hoped that this will help researchers record and document Wakhi poetry, literature and [[history]].
