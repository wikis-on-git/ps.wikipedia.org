Some disagreement exists over the meaning of the word "Hamas" itself. ''Hamas'' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase حركة المقاومة الاسلامية, or '''Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya''' or "Islamic Resistance Movement". Ami Isseroff on ''MidEast web'' states that the acronym is also the Arabic word for "zeal".<ref>[http://www.mideastweb.org/hamashistory.htm "A History of the Hamas Movement"]. Copyright 1999-2002.

Sheikh Ahmed Yassin founded Hamas in 1987 as an offshoot of [[Egypt]]'s [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. The acronym "Hamas" first appeared in 1987 in a leaflet that accused the Israeli [[Mossad|intelligence service]]s of undermining the moral fiber of Palestinian youth as part of Mossad's recruitment of what Hamas termed "[[collaborator]]s". The [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], the military branch, was created in 1992, a year before the [[Oslo Accords]].

On [[January 26]] [[2004]], senior Hamas official [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] offered a 10-year truce, or ''[[hudna]]'', in return for a complete withdrawal by Israel from the [[Green Line (Israel)|territories captured]] in the [[Six Day War]], and the establishment of a Palestinian state (it remade the same offer after winning the majority in the [[PLC]], accepting the 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]]<ref> {{fr icon}} {{Cite news | title=Le Quartet cherche une solution à la banqueroute palestinienne | date=May 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 9, 2006 | publisher=[[Le Monde]]|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3218,36-769645,0.html}} </ref>).

Rantissi confirmed that Hamas had come to the conclusion that it was "difficult to liberate all our land at this stage, so we accept a phased liberation."

From the time of an attack on the Israeli southern town of [[Be'er Sheva]] in August 2004, in which 15 people were killed and 125 wounded, the truce was generally observed.

There was a brief war in which [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Hamas seized control of Gaza]] and the Palestinian Authority was effectively split in two: Hamas controlling of Gaza and Fatah controlling the West Bank. It is reported that violence continued as of [[June 16]]th, 2007.

Founded in 1987, Hamas was the [[Gaza Strip]] branch of the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]] movement founded in Egypt. Hamas is opposed to the existence of [[Israel]], with one Hamas parliamentarian denouncing the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] as "not a peace process" and "a process of deception and cheating and lies which enabled Israel to truncate our homeland with settlements and separation walls and roadblocks and closed military zones."<ref>Khalid Amayreh. [http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=18342 "'Cartoons reflect Europe's Islamophobia'"]. Interview with Aziz Duwaik. ''Al Jazeera English''. February 6, 2006. </ref> In 2004 Hamas offered a 10-year truce, or ''[[hudna]]'', in exchange for several conditions including a complete withdrawal from [[Israeli-occupied territories]] (''[[#2004 — A 10-year truce|see below]]'').

Hamas regards the territory of the present-day State of Israel — as well as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank — as an inalienable Islamic [[waqf]] or religious bequest, which can never be surrendered to [[non-Muslim]]s. It asserts that struggle (''[[jihad]]'') to regain control of the land from Israel is the religious duty of every Muslim (''fard `ain''). Hamas does not recognize Israel as a sovereign state, unlike the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), which has recognized it since 1988, and calls it the "[[Zionist entity]]". Its charter calls for an end to Israel. During the election campaign, Hamas did not mention its call for the destruction of Israel in its electoral manifesto.<ref name="guard1">{{cite news|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 12, 2006|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1684472,00.html|title=Hamas drops call for destruction of Israel from manifesto}}</ref> But several Hamas candidates insist that the charter is still in force and often called for Israel to be "wiped off the map" in campaign speeches.

According to the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], Hamas views the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] as "a religious struggle between [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] that can only be resolved by the destruction of the State of Israel".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hamas: The Fundamentalist Challenge to the PLO|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=116|date=April, 1992}}</ref> Hamas uses both political activities and violence to pursue its goal of establishing an Islamic [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]] in place of Israel and the secular [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]. Israeli military operations during the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] in 2002 put pressure on Hamas in the West Bank following several bombings in Israel for which Hamas claimed responsibility. Hamas has also engaged in peaceful political activities, including running candidates in West Bank [[Chamber of commerce]] elections.

During the election campaign the organization toned down criticism of Israel in its election manifesto, stating only that it was prepared to use "armed resistance to end the occupation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/6296|title= Islamistisk politik vinner mark|author=Madelene Axelsson|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]]}} {{sv icon}}</ref>

The slogan of Hamas is "God is its target, [[Muhammad|the Prophet]] is its model, the [[Qur'an]] its [[constitution]]: Jihad is its path and death for the sake of God is the loftiest of its wishes." Hamas states that its objective is to support the oppressed and wronged and "to bring about justice and defeat injustice, in word and deed." Hamas believes that "the land of Palestine is an Islamic [[Waqf]] (trust) consecrated for future Muslim generations until [[Qiyamah|Judgement Day]]," and as such, the land cannot be negotiated away by any political leader. Hamas rejects "so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences" as "in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement", stating "there is no solution for the Palestinian question except through [[Jihad]]".{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

=== [[اسلام]]===
Like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], which Hamas branched off from, Hamas believes the rules of Islam, or the [[Sharia]] to be a sufficient guide for all areas of life. Since Hamas sees Islam as a sufficent guide for all areas in life, and as a way of life, they, as the Covenant of Hamas says, tries to make Islam its programme.<ref>http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hamas_Covenant</ref>

=== The Covenant of Hamas ===
{{see also|wikisource:Hamas Covenant}}
The 1988 [[wikisource:Hamas Covenant|Hamas Covenant]] (or Charter) states that the organization's goal is to "raise the banner of [[Allah|God]] over every inch of Palestine," in order to establish an [[Islamic Republic]].

The thirty-six articles of the Covenant detail the movement's Islamist beliefs regarding the primacy of Islam in all aspects of life. The Covenant identifies Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and considers its members to be Muslims who "fear God and raise the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors." Hamas describes resisting and quelling the enemy as the individual duty of every Muslim and prescribes revolutionary roles for all members of society; including men and women, professionals, scientists and students.

The Covenant outlines the organization's position on various issues, including social and economic development and ideological influences, education, as well as its position regarding Israel. Amongst many other things, it reiterates the group's rejection of the coexistence principle of the [[peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

=== Freemasons, Lions Club and the Rotarians ===

Hamas categorizes the [[Freemason]]s, [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club]], and the [[Rotary International|Rotarians]] as organizations promoting "the interest of [[Zionism]]." It accuses those organizations, and the "Zionist invasion" in general, of being "behind the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]] and [[alcoholism]] in all its kinds." Hamas believes that Zionism was "behind the [[French Revolution]], the [[Communist revolution]] and most of the revolutions we heard and hear about, here and there. With their money they formed secret societies, such as Freemasons, Rotary Clubs, the Lions and others in different parts of the world for the purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests."<ref>[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/hamas.htm Hamas Covenant]</ref>

=== Antisemitism ===
Hamas' critics argue that Hamas is "full of hatred towards the Jews."<ref>[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/WUPJ-9-2004.htm Statement by Guest Representative Prof. Robert S. Wistrich], 29 March 2004. United Nations Commission On Human Rights (15 March-23 April 2004). Question: Violation human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world (item 9)</ref> Critics also state Hamas is primarily [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]], but perceives Judaism as wholly embracing [[Zionism]], and therefore has often failed to distinguish between the two.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anti-semitic motifs in Hamas leaflets, 1987–1992|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=51#motifs|publisher=[[The Institute for Counter-Terrorism]]|date=July 9, 1998}}</ref>

The Covenant cites ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', the propagandist book falsely attributed to Jews, stating it embodies a "Zionist plan" for "limitless" territorial expansion: 
<blockquote>Today it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"</blockquote>

Other articles of the Hamas Covenant refer to fighting the Jews.
According to [[Robert Wistrich]],
<blockquote>"Like other Islamists, the Hamas uses antisemitic language, full of hatred towards Jews, ever since its foundation in 1987. In its Sacred Covenant [18 August 1988], there are frequent references to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which would have gladdened the hearts of Hitler and Goebbels. It is difficult to see what any of this has to do with spirituality, works of charity, dialogue or the search for peace."<ref>[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/WUPJ-9-2004.htm Statement  by Guest Representative Prof. Robert S. Wistrich], 29 March 2004. United Nations Commission On Human Rights (15 March-23 April 2004). Question: Violation human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world (item 9)</ref></blockquote>

In 1998, Esther Webman of the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the [[Tel Aviv University]]
wrote: "...the anti-Semitic rhetoric in Hamas leaflets is frequent and intense. Nevertheless, anti-Semitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology. Generally no differentiation was made in the leaflets between Jew and Zionist, in as much as Judaism was perceived as embracing Zionism, although in other Hamas publications and in interviews with its leaders attempts at this differentiation have been made."<ref>{{cite web|title=Anti-semitic motifs in Hamas leaflets, 1987–1992|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=51#motifs|publisher=[[The Institute for Counter-Terrorism]]|date=July 9, 1998}}</ref>

According to [[Meir Litvak]]'s 2003 study, "In Hamas' literature, antisemitism became almost dominant. Earlier antisemitic motifs are developed time and again in their magazine Falastin al-Muslama. Almost every issue contains anti-Jewish articles using elements from the Islamic tradition. Judaism is presented as a religion based on lies, which from its origin called for aggression against others and their exploitation."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Development of Arab Anti-Semitism|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-5.htm|date=February 2, 2003|publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref>

Also in 2003, the director of Hamas Children’s Summer Camp in Gaza City, Sohab Alissa, was anti-Semitic:
<blockquote>“The first thing we want to teach them is their cause. They know from daily experience that their enemy is the Jew — our job is to explain why.

[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]</ref></blockquote>

The chief of Hamas's political bureau [[Khaled Meshaal]] also denied antisemitism in Hamas's ideology in February, 2006:
<blockquote>"Our message to the Israelis is this: We do not fight you because you belong to a certain faith or culture. Jews have lived in the Muslim world for 13 centuries in peace and harmony; they are in our religion "the people of the book" who have a covenant from God and his messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him), to be respected and protected."
<p>
"Our conflict with you is not religious but political. We have no problem with Jews who have not attacked us — our problem is with those who came to our land, imposed themselves on us by force, destroyed our society and banished our people."<ref>{{cite news|title='We shall never recognize... a Zionist state on our soil'|date=February 1, 2006|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=

On 30 March 2007, Hamas spokesman Ismail Radwan ended his "prayers to Allah" in a sermon broadcast on the Palestinian Authority’s TV quoting the [[hadith]] "The Hour [of Resurrection] will not take place until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them, and the rock and the tree will say: 'Oh, Muslim, servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, kill him!'"

Hamas is particularly popular among Palestinians in the [[Gaza Strip]], though it also has a following in the [[West Bank]], and to a lesser extent in other Middle Eastern countries. Since its formation in 1987, Hamas has conducted numerous social, political, and military actions. Its popularity stems in part from its [[social welfare|welfare]] and social services to Palestinians in the [[occupied territories]], including school and hospital construction. The group devotes much of its estimated $70 million annual budget to an extensive social services network, running many relief and education programs, and funds schools, orphanages, mosques, healthcare clinics, soup kitchens, and sports leagues. According to the Israeli scholar [[Reuven Paz]] "approximately 90 percent of the organization's work is in social, welfare, cultural, and educational activities".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/hamas.html|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=March 16, 2006|title=Hamas: Background Q&A}}</ref> These programs are viewed variously as part of a sincere social development agenda, an integrated para-state policy, as [[propaganda]] and [[recruitment]] exercises, or any combination thereof.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
In fact, by providing these services they succeeded in acquiring popularity among the Palestine people and gaining their political allegiance; this is related to the concept of a [[political machine]]. Their funds come from  [[OPEC]] representatives in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Iran]], as well as charitable donations from local and international community. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In 1973, the Islamic center 'Mujamma' was established in Gaza and started to offer clinics, blood banks, day care, medical treatment, meals and youth clubs. The centre plays an important role for providing social care to the people, particularly those living in refugee camps. It also extended financial aid and scholarships to young people who wanted to study in Saudi Arabia and the West.<ref>{{cite news | title=Is It really So Surprising? — Hamas Victory In Palestine | date=8 January, 2006 | url=http://www.countercurrents.org/pa-rose080206.htm }}</ref>
In particular, Hamas funded health services where people could receive free or inexpensive medical treatment. Hamas greatly contributed to the health sector, and facilitated hospital and physician services in the Palestinian territory. On the other hand, Hamas’s use of hospitals is sometimes criticised as purportedly serving the promotion of suicide bombings and other forms of violence against Israel. 
Hamas also funded education as well as the health service, and built Islamic charities, libraries, mosques, education centers for women. They also built nurseries, kindergartens and supervised religious schools that provide free meals to children. When children attend their schools and mosques, parents are required to sign oaths of allegiance.
Refugees, as well as those left without homes, are able to claim financial and technical assistance from Hamas.<ref>Peter Hilsenrath {{cite news | title=HEALTH POLICY AS COUNTER-TERRORISM: HEALTH SERVICES AND THE PALESTINIANS | date=October, 2005|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/media/78u409g64p5jvh491v5m/contributions/x/2/6/5/x26530218g04pll8.pdf}}</ref> 

In any case, Hamas has significantly increased literacy in areas where it is active{{Fact|date=October 2007}}.

===Children's web site===
Al Fateh is Hamas' web site for children [http://www.al-fateh.net]. According to ''The Museum of Harmony and Golden Section'', "Al-Fateh" means "first".<ref>[http://www.goldenmuseum.com/1401Libya_engl.html "Libya: the land of infinite variety and contrast"]. ''Museum of Harmony and Golden Section''.</ref> According to ''Our Jerusalem'', it means "conqueror".<ref>[http://www.ourjerusalem.com/press/story/on-camera-column-ignoring-hamas-hate-indoctrination.html  "On CAMERA Column: Ignoring Hamas Hate-Indoctrination"]. ''Our Jerusalem''. February 9th, 2006.</ref> The site says it is for "the young builders of the future." 

Several [[Israel]]i reviews and news coverages of the site describe it as hate mongering and accuse it of teaching violence and terrorism to children [http://www.pmw.org.il/LatestBulletins.htm#b160306], [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3225214,00.html], [http://www.ourjerusalem.com/press/story/on-camera-column-ignoring-hamas-hate-indoctrination.html]

According to [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]] "Issue number 38 of Al-Fateh, includes a photograph of the decapitated head of a female suicide bomber. The caption reads "Zaynab Abu Salem who carried out the suicide bombing attack. Her head was severed from her pure body and her headscarf remained to decorate her face. Your place is in heaven in the upper sky, Zaynab ... sister [raised to the status of heroic] men." Abu Salem had killed two Israeli border policemen and wounded 17." ''The Al Fateh web site contains images of graphic violence that may be shocking to some. Some of the sites reviewing the Al Fateh site contain examples of those images.''

Criticism has come from many quarters. [[Mark Regev]], Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman, was outraged that "children are taught that killing Jews is a good thing." Basem Abu Sumaya, head of the [[Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation]], stated "I don't think it's professional or even humane to use children in such harsh political programs."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/08/africa/ME-GEN-Palestinians-Hamas-Mickey-Mouse.php "Hamas "Mickey Mouse" calls for Muslim world domination"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', [[May 8]], [[2007]]</ref>

On May 9, at the request of the Palestinian Information Ministry, Hamas suspended the program. Information minister [[Mustafa Barghouti]] said it was wrong to direct political messages at children and that "Any media outlet that breaks Palestinian broadcasting law will be penalized by the Information Ministry."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/857709.html "PA pulls Hamas TV children`s program with mock Mickey Mouse advocating violence"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[May 9]], [[2007]]</ref> But according to the British Daily Telegraph, a spokesman for the station, which is owned and run by Hamas, later announced that the program would continue and that to remove it would be a political surrender to Israel.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/11/whamas11.xml "Anti-Israel 'Mickey Mouse' row escalates"]. Telegraph.co.uk.</ref>

The program then returned to Palestinian TV,<ref name="kwt1">[http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MTY2ODY0MDkwNg== "Hamas Mickey is back on TV"], ''[[Kuwait Times]] online'', [[2007-05-12]], Retrieved on [[2007-05-18]]</ref> again garnering international attention when in an episode which aired on [[June 29]], [[2007]], Farfour [the mouse] was shown being beaten to death by an Israeli who had tried to buy his land, and whom he labels a terrorist. The presenter Saraa said that he was "martyred defending his land", and was killed "by the killers of children".<ref name="guard1" /> The program has since returned to regular broadcast, with Farfour replaced by a new character, Nahoul the Bumblebee.

On 24/8/2007, News media reported the Hamas Al-Aqsa TV aired a 'Lion King' cartoon to portray the Hamas victory in the Gaza.<ref>[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1540.htm Clip of Hamas-Style Lion King Vanquishes Fatah Rats]. MEMRI TV</ref>

=== Crackdown on dissent and on the Press===

Human rights groups and ordinary Gazans accuse Hamas of forcefully clamping down dissent. Hamas is using means which are criminal including: Torture, political detentions and firing on un-armed protestors who object Hamas policies.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/26/wgaza126.xml].

Hamas have also been harassing and arresting Palestinian journalists in Gaza [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/25/africa/ME-GEN-Palestinians-Journalists-Protest.php],[http://www.wafa.ps/english/body.asp?id=10292]. On [[August 29]], [[2007]] Palestinian health officials reported that Hamas has been shuting down Gaza clinic as retaliation for doctor strikes - Hamas confirmed that "punitive measure against doctors" who - according to Hamas - "incite others to strike and suspend services" have been taken. [http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSL28500882._CH_.2400]

On August 28th, 2007 Hamas media workers slipped into an anti-Hamas rally in intention to disperse it from within.[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6249803.html]

On August 31st, 2007 two French journalists were hit by an explosive device as they were covering a Fatah demo in which Hamas forces used violence[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/31/africa/ME-GEN-Palestinians-Gaza-Clash.php]

=== Other ===
[http://www.palestine-info.info/ The main website of Hamas] provides translations of official communiqués in [[Persian language]], [[Urdu]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

In 2005, Hamas announced its intention to launch an experimental TV channel, "[[Al-Aqsa]]". The station was launched on January 7, 2006, less than three weeks before the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative elections]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamas launches “Al-Aqsa”, an experimental TV channel intended to improve its propaganda and indoctrination capabilities|date=January 22, 2006|url=http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/eng_n/al_aqsa_e.htm|publisher=Center for Special Studies}}</ref> It included a TV show for children.

== Militancy and terrorism ==
=== Suicide attacks ===
Suicide attacks are the main element of what the group sees as its [[asymmetric warfare]] against Israel. Since the group considers all Israel to be a "[[militarism|militarized]] society" (there is [[Israel#Military|mandatory military service]] for many Israelis), Hamas condones attacks on civilian targets. The group's willingness to target civilian facilities including buses, supermarkets, and restaurants is the reason why some governments classify it as a terrorist movement (although Hamas claims being a [[national liberation movement]]).

Hamas' first use of [[suicide bombing]] occurred on [[April 16]], [[1993]] when a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden van detonated between two buses parked at a restaurant. It was Hamas' 19th known attack since 1989 (the others being shootings, kidnappings and knife attacks).<ref> [http://www.ict.org.il/inter_ter/orgattack.cfm?orgid=13 Hamas attacks (1988–2002)] The Institute for Counter-Terrorism</ref>

Hamas continued to launch suicide attacks during the Oslo Accords period (see [[List of Hamas suicide attacks]]). 

During the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|second Intifada]], Hamas, along with the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad Movement]], spearheaded the violence through the years of the Palestinian uprising.<ref> {{cite news | title=Victory leaves Hamas with a dilemma (Opinion) | publisher=[[The Telegraph]] | date=January 27, 2006|url=http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/01/27/do2702.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2006/01/27/ixopinion.html}} </ref> Since then Hamas has conducted many attacks on Israel, mainly through its military wing — the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]]. These attacks have included large-scale [[suicide bombing]]s against Israeli civilian targets, the most deadly of which was the bombing of a [[Netanya]] hotel on [[March 27]], [[2002]], in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded. This attack has also been referred to as the [[Netanya suicide attack|Passover massacre]] since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of [[Passover]]. Overall, from November 2000 to April 2004, 377 Israeli citizens and soldiers were killed and 2,076 wounded in 425 attacks by Hamas. ([http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&id=7&docid=30286.EN Source: IDF website].) The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains a comprehensive list of Hamas attacks. [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terror+Groups/Hamas+terror+attacks+22 March 2004.htm]

A few [[female suicide bomber]]s, including a mother of six and a mother of two children under the age of 10 have also executed suicide bombings. [[Abdel Aziz Rantisi]] has said, <blockquote>
"The Hamas movement is prepared to stop terror against Israeli civilians if Israel stops killing Palestinian civilians ... We have told (Palestinian Authority Prime Minister) Abu Mazen in our meetings that there is an opportunity to stop targeting Israeli civilians if the Israelis stop assassinations and raids and stop brutalizing Palestinian civilians."<ref>{{cite web| title=Arnon Regular|publisher=Ha'reetz |url= http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol4no1_2005/reinhart_complex.htm| date=May 25, 2003|}}</ref></blockquote> 

In May 2006 Israel arrested Hamas top official [[Ibrahim Hamed]] whom Israeli security officials claim was responsible for dozens of [[suicide bombings]] and other attacks on Israelis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/1,2506,L-3254071,00.html|title= Top Hamas fugitive nabbed|publisher=ynetnews.com|date=[[May 23]], [[2006]]}}</ref>

=== Shelling and rocket attacks on civilians ===
Since 2002, Hamas has used homemade [[Qassam rocket]]s to hit Israeli towns in the [[Negev]], such as [[Sderot]]. The introduction of the ''Qassam-2 rocket'' has allowed Hamas to reach large Israeli cities such as [[Ashkelon]], bringing great concern to the Israeli populace and many attempts by the Israeli military to stop the proliferation and use of the rockets.

=== Guerilla warfare ===
Hamas has made great use of guerrilla tactics in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3310425,00.html|publisher=[[Ynet News]] |date=October 3 2006|title=Report: Hamas weighing large-scale conflict with Israel}}</ref> Hamas has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception. According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled "between several hundred and 1,300 tons" of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza. Some Israelis and some Gazans both noted similarities in Hamas's military buildup to that of Hezbollah in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3310425,00.html|publisher=[[Ynet News]] |date=October 3 2006|title=Report: Hamas weighing large-scale conflict with Israel}}</ref>

Successful use of IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices) and anti-tank missiles against Israeli Military incursions into the Gaza Strip have proven highly effective in both casualties inflicted upon the Israeli forces, as well as slowing or stopping these incursions in their tracks. Furthermore, the IDF has a difficult, if not impossible time trying to find hidden weapons caches in Palestinian areas — this due to the high local support base Hamas enjoys in Gaza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/history/levineconference/papers/aburaiya.pdf#search=%22hamas%20enjoys%20great%20popular%20support%22|Author=Issam Aburaiya|date=October 3 2006|title=Hamas and Palestinian Nationalism}}</ref>

=== Others attacked ===
In addition to killing Israeli civilians, Hamas has also attacked Israeli military and security forces (occasionally inside Israel), suspected Palestinian [[collaborator]]s, and [[Fatah]] rivals.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&pubid=968163964505&cid=1159712646109&col=968705899037&call_page=TS_News&call_pageid=968332188492&call_pagepath=News/News Fatah, Hamas gunbattles kill 7] (Toronto Star) October 1, 2006</ref>

=== Call to attack United States targets ===
On [[November 8]], [[2006]] the military wing of Hamas called on Muslims around the world to attack American targets. "America is offering political, financial and logistic cover for the Zionist occupation crimes, and it is responsible for the Beit Hanoun massacre. Therefore, the people and the nation all over the globe are required to teach the American enemy tough lessons," Hamas said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. Ghazi Hamad, spokesman for the Hamas-led Palestinian government said that the group had no intention of attacking American targets and denied any involvement with the statement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1162378352193&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=November 8 2006|title=Hamas to Muslims: Attack US targets}}</ref>

It has been argued that Hamas threatens the United States due to the number of alleged Hamas [[covert cells]] the [[FBI]] and [[United States Department of Justice]] are aware of on U.S. soil.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2004/marzook_et_al.pdf United States v. Abu Marzook]. No. 03 CR 978 12. IL District Ct. 2005.</ref><ref>Lake, Eli.

===Summary executions===
[[Human Rights Watch]] has cited a number of summary executions as particular examples of violations of the rules of warfare, including the case of Muhammad Swairki, 28, a cook for Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard, who was thrown to his death, with his hands and legs tied, from a 15-story apartment building in Gaza City. [http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1316850.php/Human_rights_group_accused_Palestinian_militants_of_&quotwar_crimes],[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/175819.aspx],[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3412683,00.html]

Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups frequently extrajudicially execute or otherwise punish those they consider collaborators with Israel, or those accused of criminal or "immoral" behaviour. Frequent killings of unarmed people have also occurred during Hamas-Fatah clashes.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2090520.stm],[http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/1210], [http://www.mideastweb.org/log/archives/00000599.htm],[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldnews&storyID=2007-06-14T180139Z_01_FLE455032_RTRUKOC_0_US-PALESTINIANS.xml],[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/10/wirq310.xml]

==International perception of Hamas==
According to [[NPR]], "Israel and many Western powers have struggled with how best to interact with a group that is at once labeled terrorist and, at the same time, is the legitimately elected leadership of the Palestinian National Authority."<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6583080 "Hamas: Government or Terrorist Organization?"].

in a recent poll [http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=256] "About six-in-ten Palestinians (62%) have a favorable opinion of the organization (Hamas), as do majorities or pluralities in Jordan and Morocco. Opinions of Hamas are divided in Egypt and Kuwait, and Hamas is viewed negatively in Turkey. The balance of public opinion in Lebanon is against Hamas (67% unfavorable), although the organization is rated favorably by half of the country’s Shia community. Hamas – a organization made mostly up of Sunnis – is overwhelmingly unpopular among Lebanese Sunnis."
