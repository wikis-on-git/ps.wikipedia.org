'''Gardening''' is the practice of growing flowering [[plant]]s, [[vegetable]]s, and [[fruit]]s. [[Residential garden|Residential gardening]] most often takes place in or about a residence, in a space referred to as the '''[[garden]]'''. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located in a [[roof garden|roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], or on a [[patio garden|patio]] or [[vivarium]].

Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as [[park]]s, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoological garden]]s), [[amusement park|amusement]] and [[theme park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels|hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of [[gardener]]s or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.

'''Indoor gardening''' is concerned with the growing of [[houseplant]]s within a residence or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. [[Indoor garden]]s are sometimes incorporated as part of [[air conditioning]] or [[heating]] systems.

'''[[Water garden]]ing''' is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and [[pond]]s. [[Bog]] gardens are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the [[water]] and plant(s).

'''[[Container garden]]ing''' is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors.  Common containers are pots, hanging baskets, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.

In respect to its food producing purpose, gardening is distinguished from [[Agriculture|farming]] chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of saleable goods as a major motivation. Gardening is done on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called [[market gardening]], can fit in either category.

The key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale: gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little [[infrastructural capital]], typically no more than a few tools, e.g. a [[spade]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[basket]] and [[watering can]]. By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves [[irrigation system]]s, chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[combine harvester|harvesters]] or at least [[ladder]]s, e.g. to reach up into [[fruit tree]]s. However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.

In part because of labor intensity and aesthetic motivations, gardening is very often much more productive per unit of land than farming. In the [[Soviet Union]], half the [[food supply]] came from small peasants' garden plots on the huge government-run [[collective farm]]s, although they were tiny patches of land. Some argue this as evidence of superiority of [[capitalism]], since the peasants were generally able to sell their produce. Others consider it to be evidence of a [[tragedy of the commons]], since the large collective plots were often neglected, or fertilizers or water redirected to the private gardens.

The term [[precision agriculture]] is sometimes used to describe gardening using [[intermediate technology]] (more than tools, less than harvesters), especially of [[organic farming|organic varieties]]. Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire [[village]]s of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the [[community garden]] which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in [[allotment (gardening)]].

[[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. In [[Japan]], for instance, [[Samurai]] and [[Zen monk]]s were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like [[flower arrangement]] known as ''[[ikebana]]''. In 18th century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[formal garden]]s or landscaped parklands, such as at [[Versailles]], France or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces.

==ټولنيز اړخ==
In modern [[Europe]] and [[North America]], people often express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The [[lawn]] vs. garden issue is played out in [[urban planning]] as the debate over the "[[land ethic]]" that is to determine [[urban land use]] and whether [[hyperhygienist]] [[bylaw]]s (e.g. [[weed control]]) should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] case, "Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto", 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the [[right of free expression]], at least in [[Canada]].

It is clear that in the [[British Isles]] (i.e. [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and The [[Isle of Man]] people surround their house and garden with a hedge, often of Privet (''[[Ligustrum]]''). The idea of open gardens without hedges is distaceful to many, they like privacy. Beech  (''[[Fagus]]'') is also used as a hedge. This has the advantage to the [[wildlife]] that there is a habitat for the [[birds]] and other wild plants (not weeds). What, therefore, is a weed? A weed is a plant in the wrong place!

Gardening is thus not only a food source and art, but also a right. The [[Slow Food]] movement has sought in some countries to add an [[edible schoolyard]] and [[garden classroom]]s to schools, e.g. in [[Fergus, Ontario]], where these were added to a public school to augment the [[kitchen classroom]].

In [[United States|US]] and [[British English|British]] usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called ''[[landscaping]]'', ''landscape maintenance'' or ''groundskeeping'', while international usage uses the term ''gardening'' for these same activities.

==Garden pests==
*A garden pest is what one considers a pest.  The beautiful ''Tropaeolum speciosum'' can be considered a pest if it [[seeds]] and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As the root is well below ground, pulling it up does not remove it: it simply grows again and becomes what may be considered a pest.
*In [[lawn]]s, moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns, [[lichens]], especially very damp lawn lichens such as [[Peltigera]] lactucfolia and P. membranacea, can become difficult and be considered pests.

== Restrictions ==
Governments of most countries are restricting imports of plant material. In the past, someone could send such things as lily seeds and bulbs to friends in any country. Today, most of those avenues are closed, due to the threat of [[invasive species]].

== History == 
{{Main|History of gardening}}
Gardening for food extends far back into [[prehistory]]. [[Ornamental Gardens|Ornamental gardens]] were known in ancient times, a famous example being the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], while [[ancient Rome]] had dozens of gardens.
