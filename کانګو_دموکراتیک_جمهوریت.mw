The '''Republic of the Congo''', also known as  '''Congo-[[Brazzaville]]''', and '''Congo''' (but not to be confused with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], formerly Zaire, which was also at one time known as the '''Republic of the Congo'''), is a former [[France|French]] [[colony]] of west-central [[Africa]]. Its borders are [[ګابون]], [[کېمرون]], [[د افريقا منځنی جمهوريت]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[آنګولا]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Upon independence in [[1960]], the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter century of experimentation with [[Marxism]] was abandoned in [[1990]] and a democratically elected government installed in [[1992]]. A brief civil war in [[1997]] restored former Marxist President [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]]. 

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[History of the Republic of the Congo]]
The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Pygmy]] peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes during [[Bantu]] [[human migration|migrations]]. The Bakongo are comprised of [[Bantu]] groups that also occupied parts of present-day [[Angola]], [[Gabon]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], forming the basis for ethnic affinities and rivalries among those states. Several Bantu kingdoms -- notably those of the [[Kongo Empire|Kongo]], the [[Loango]], and the [[Teke]] -- built trade links leading into the [[Congo River]] basin. The first European contacts came in the late 15th century, and commercial relationships were quickly established with the kingdoms--trading for slaves captured in the interior. The coastal area was a major source for the transatlantic slave trade, and when that commerce ended in the early 19th century, the power of the Bantu kingdoms eroded.

The area came under [[France|French]] sovereignty in the [[1880s]] as part of AEF, the [[French Equatorial Africa]] (modern-day [[Gabon]], [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]], and [[Republic of Congo]]).  Economic underdevelopment during the first 50 years of colonial rule in Congo centered on natural resource extraction by private companies. In 1924-34, the Congo-Ocean Railway (CFCO) was built at a considerable human and financial cost, opening the way for growth of the ocean port of [[Pointe-Noire]] and towns along its route.

During [[World War II]], [[Brazzaville]] became the symbolic capital of [[Free France]] during 1940-43. The [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944]] heralded a period of major reform in French colonial policy, including the abolition of forced labor, granting of French citizenship to colonial subjects, decentralization of certain powers, and election of local advisory assemblies. Congo benefited from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructural spending as a result of its central geographic location within AEF and the federal capital at Brazzaville.

Following independence as the '''Congo Republic''' on [[August 15]] [[1960]], [[Fulbert Youlou]] ruled as the country's first president until labor elements and rival political parties instigated a  3-day uprising that ousted him.  The Congolese military took charge of the country briefly and installed a civilian provisional government headed by [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]]. Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-Débat was elected President for a 5-year term but it was ended abruptly with an August [[1968]] coup d'état.  Capt. [[Marien Ngouabi]], who had participated in the coup, assumed the presidency on [[December 31]], [[1968]]. One year later, President Ngouabi proclaimed Congo to be Africa's first "people's republic" and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the Congolese Labor Party (PCT).  On [[March 16]], [[1977]], President Ngouabi was assassinated.  An 11-member Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was named to head an interim government with Col. (later Gen.) [[Joachim Yhombi-Opango]] to serve as President of the Republic.

After decades of turbulent politics bolstered by [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] rhetoric, and with the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Congo completed a transition to [[multi-party]] democracy with elections in August [[1992]].   [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]] conceded defeat and Congo's new president, Prof. [[Pascal Lissouba]], was inaugurated on [[August 31]], [[1992]].

However, Congo's democratic progress was derailed in [[1997]]. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted. On June 5, President Lissouba's government forces surrounded Sassou's compound in Brazzaville and Sassou ordered his militia to resist. Thus began a 4-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville. In early October, [[Angola]]n troops invaded Congo on the side of Sassou and, in mid-October, the Lissouba government fell. Soon thereafter, Sassou declared himself President.  

Elections in [[2002]] saw Sassou win with almost 90% of the vote.  His two main rivals Lissouba and [[Bernard Kolelas]] were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival, [[Andre Milongo]], advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race. A new [[constitution]] was agreed in January 2002 which granted the president new powers and also extended his term to seven years as well as introducing a new bicameral assembly.

== جغرافيه ==
''Main article: [[Geography of the Republic of the Congo]]''

Congo is located in the central-western part of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], straddling the [[Equator]]. To the south and east it is bounded by the [[Congo River]] and its tributary the [[Ubangi River]], across which is the larger [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is also bounded by [[Gabon]] to the west, [[Cameroon]] and the [[Central African Republic]] to the north, and [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] ([[Angola]]) to the southwest. It has a short [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. 

Its capital, [[Brazzaville]], is located on the Congo River,in the south of the country, immediately across from [[Kinshasa]], the capital of the DR Congo.

The southwest of the country is a coastal plain for which the primary drainage is the [[Kouilou-Niari River]]; the interior of the country consists of a central plateau between two basins to the south and north. Below is a map of the Republic of the Congo.

== اقتصاد ==
''Main article: [[Economy of the Republic of the Congo]]''

The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on [[petroleum]], support services, and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Petroleum extraction has supplanted [[forestry]] as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. In the early [[1980s]], rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its petroleum earnings, contributing to a shortage of revenues. The [[January 12]], [[1994]] devaluation of [[CFA franc|Franc Zone]] currencies by 50% resulted in inflation of 61% in [[1994]], but inflation has subsided since. Economic reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations, notably the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]]. The reform program came to a halt in June [[1997]] when civil war erupted. When Sassou-Nguesso returned to power at the war ended in October [[1997]], he publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. However, economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December [[1998]], which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic problems of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty.
