'''درملپېژندنه''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''pharmacon (&#966;&#940;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;)'' meaning drug, and ''logos (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;)'' meaning science) is the study of how chemical substances interact with living systems. If substances have [[medication|medicinal]] properties, they are considered '''pharmaceuticals'''. The field encompasses drug composition and properties, [[interaction]]s, [[toxicology]], [[therapy]], and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities.  The science is considered to have been invented by Arabic physicians in Baghdad during the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]]; pharmacopoeias were penned in Arabic as early as the 7th century (Amin A. Khairallah: ''Outline of Arabic Contributions to Medicine'': ''Chapter X, Chemistry and Pharmacy''. 1946, ).

[[Drug development|Development of medication]] is a vital concern to [[medicine]], but also has strong economical and political implications. To protect the consumer and prevent abuse, many governments regulate the manufacture, sale, and administration of medication. In the [[United States]], the main regulatory body is the [[Food and Drug Administration]] through its publication of the [[United States Pharmacopoeia|USP]].

Pharmacology as a science is practiced by pharmacologists. Subdisciplines are ''clinical pharmacology'' (the medical field of medication effects on humans), ''neuro-'' and ''psychopharmacology'' (effects of medication on behavior and nervous system functioning), and ''theoretical pharmacology''.

==ساينسي مخينه==
The study of medicinal chemicals requires intimate knowledge of the biological system affected. With the knowledge of [[cell biology]] and [[biochemistry]] increasing, the field of pharmacology has also changed substantially. It has become possible, through molecular analysis of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, to design chemicals that act on specific cellular signalling or [[metabolic pathway]]s by affecting sites directly on cell-surface receptors (which modulate and mediate cellular signalling pathways controlling cellular function).

A chemical has, from the pharmacological point-of-view, various properties. [[Pharmacokinetics]] describes its behaviour in the body - particularly in the blood (e.g. its [[half-life]] and [[volume of distribution]]), and [[pharmacodynamics]] relates its behaviour in the blood to its effects (desired effects or [[toxic]] side-effects).

When describing the pharmacokinetic properties of a chemical, pharmacologists are often interested in ''[[ADME]]'':
* [[Absorption]] - How is the medication absorbed (through the skin, the intestine, the oral mucosa)?
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|Distribution]] - How does it spread through the organism?
* [[Drug metabolism|Metabolism]] - Is the medication converted chemically inside the body, and into which substances. Are these active? Could they be toxic?
* [[Excretion]] - How is the medication eliminated (through the bile, urine, breath, skin)?

Medication is said to have a narrow or wide ''[[therapeutic index]]'' or ''therapeutic window''. This describes the ratio of desired effect to toxic effect. A compound with a narrow therapeutic index (close to 1) exerts its desired effect at a dose close to its toxic dose. A compound with a wide therapeutic index (greater than 5) exerts its desired effect at a dose substantially below its toxic dose. Those with a narrow window are more difficult to dose and administer, and may require [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] (examples are [[warfarin]], some [[antiepileptic]]s, [[aminoglycoside]] antibiotics). Most anti-cancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic margin: toxic side-effects are almost always encountered at doses used to kill tumours.

Medication can be usually classified in various ways, e.g. by its chemical properties, mode of administration, or biological system affected. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]].
