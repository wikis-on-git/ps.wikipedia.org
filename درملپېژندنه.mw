'''درملپېژندنه''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''pharmacon (&#966;&#940;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;)'' meaning drug, and ''logos (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;)'' meaning science) is the study of how chemical substances interact with living systems. If substances have [[medication|medicinal]] properties, they are considered '''pharmaceuticals'''. The field encompasses drug composition and properties, [[interaction]]s, [[toxicology]], [[therapy]], and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities.  The science is considered to have been invented by Arabic physicians in Baghdad during the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]]; pharmacopoeias were penned in Arabic as early as the 7th century (Amin A. Khairallah: ''Outline of Arabic Contributions to Medicine'': ''Chapter X, Chemistry and Pharmacy''. 1946, ).

[[Drug development|Development of medication]] is a vital concern to [[medicine]], but also has strong economical and political implications. To protect the consumer and prevent abuse, many governments regulate the manufacture, sale, and administration of medication. In the [[United States]], the main regulatory body is the [[Food and Drug Administration]] through its publication of the [[United States Pharmacopoeia|USP]].

Pharmacology as a science is practiced by pharmacologists. Subdisciplines are ''clinical pharmacology'' (the medical field of medication effects on humans), ''neuro-'' and ''psychopharmacology'' (effects of medication on behavior and nervous system functioning), and ''theoretical pharmacology''.

==Scientific background==
The study of medicinal chemicals requires intimate knowledge of the biological system affected. With the knowledge of [[cell biology]] and [[biochemistry]] increasing, the field of pharmacology has also changed substantially. It has become possible, through molecular analysis of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, to design chemicals that act on specific cellular signalling or [[metabolic pathway]]s by affecting sites directly on cell-surface receptors (which modulate and mediate cellular signalling pathways controlling cellular function).

A chemical has, from the pharmacological point-of-view, various properties. [[Pharmacokinetics]] describes its behaviour in the body - particularly in the blood (e.g. its [[half-life]] and [[volume of distribution]]), and [[pharmacodynamics]] relates its behaviour in the blood to its effects (desired effects or [[toxic]] side-effects).

When describing the pharmacokinetic properties of a chemical, pharmacologists are often interested in ''[[ADME]]'':
* [[Absorption]] - How is the medication absorbed (through the skin, the intestine, the oral mucosa)?
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|Distribution]] - How does it spread through the organism?
* [[Drug metabolism|Metabolism]] - Is the medication converted chemically inside the body, and into which substances. Are these active? Could they be toxic?
* [[Excretion]] - How is the medication eliminated (through the bile, urine, breath, skin)?

Medication is said to have a narrow or wide ''[[therapeutic index]]'' or ''therapeutic window''. This describes the ratio of desired effect to toxic effect. A compound with a narrow therapeutic index (close to 1) exerts its desired effect at a dose close to its toxic dose. A compound with a wide therapeutic index (greater than 5) exerts its desired effect at a dose substantially below its toxic dose. Those with a narrow window are more difficult to dose and administer, and may require [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] (examples are [[warfarin]], some [[antiepileptic]]s, [[aminoglycoside]] antibiotics). Most anti-cancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic margin: toxic side-effects are almost always encountered at doses used to kill tumours.

==Classification==
Medication can be usually classified in various ways, e.g. by its chemical properties, mode of administration, or biological system affected. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]].
