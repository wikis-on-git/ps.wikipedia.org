'''Karma''' is a concept in [[Hinduism]], based on the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishad]]s, which explains [[causality]] through a system where beneficial events are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful events from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a person's [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] lives. [[Karma]] in Hinduism is used to explain the [[problem of evil]] that persists in spite of an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[benevolence|benevolent]] [[God]]; it is thus related to [[theodicy]]. "Karma" may also mean a Hindu religious vow or ritual.

The [[Mahabharata]] is sometimes anaylsed as a Karma story, a story where people received the reward of their actions, good and bad. The original Hindu concept of karma was later elaborated on by several other movements within the religion, most notably [[Vedanta]], [[Yoga]], and [[Tantra]]. The concept was adopted by other religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], whose views differ from Hinduism as the concept of Karma does not involve a personal supreme God. Karma has had a major influence on worldwide philosophy and spirituality.

==Definition==
"Karma" literally means "deed" or "act", and more broadly names the universal principle of [[cause]] and [[effect]], action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all life. Karma is not [[destiny|fate]]; humans are believed to act with [[free will]], creating their own destinies. According to the Vedas, if an individual sows [[goodness and value theory|goodness]], he or she will reap goodness; if one sows [[evil]], he or she will reap evil. Karma refers to the totality of mankind's actions and their concommitant reactions in current and previous lives, all of which determine the future. However, many karmas do not have an immediate effect; some accumulate and return unexpectedly in an individual's later lives. The conquest of karma is believed to lie in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction.

Unkindness yields spoiled fruits, called ''papa'', and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called ''[[punya]]''. As one acts, so does he become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.<ref>Subramuniyaswami, Satguru Sivaya. ''Dancing with Siva''.</ref>

There are three types of karma in Hinduism:
# [[sanchita karma]], the sum total of past karmas yet to be resolved; 
# [[prarabdha karma]], that portion of sanchita karma that is to be experienced in this life; and 
# [[kriyamana karma]], the karma that humans are currently creating, which will bear fruit in future.

==Karma as practised actions==
Karma may also mean a Hindu religious vow or ritual. In the Hindu tradition, emphasis is placed on performing certain ''karmas'' or actions; these include:

*''[[Nitya-karma]]''
*''[[Kaamya-karma]]''

''Nitya-karma'' are those actions which have to be performed daily by Hindus; for example [[Sandhyavandanam]] is an important ''nitya-karma''. Certain ''nitya-karmas'', such as ''[[darsha-purna-maseshti]]'', are performed once in a fortnight, and are therefore called ''naimittika karma''.

''Kaamya-karma'' are those ''karmas'' performed with a certain objective, such as ''[[putrakameshti]]''.

==The role of God==
While the action of karma has often been compared with the [[Western culture|Western]] notions of [[sin]] and judgment by [[God]], karma instead has been commonly perceived by Westerners to operate as a [[law of nature]] without the intervention of any supernatural being. That notion is not accurate with regard to Hinduism, though it holds true for [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

Karma in Hinduism does involve the role of God. Unlike Buddhists and Jains who believe that karma on its own joins the soul when it reincarnates, Hindus believe in the role of God in linking karma to an individual. 

===Hindu scriptures on mitigation of karma by God===
Some non-Hindu theologians interpret the concept of the relationship between God and karma to indicate that God is neutral and detached towards all, and thus He has no power in controlling karma. It is admitted that God is free of cruelty and is hence not partial to anyone, but it is also held that those who seek Him will find His grace. However, Hindus believe that God is all-merciful, and His grace can overcome or mitigate the karma of man in many cases. It is still important to remember that man has free will and must seek Him. The nature of God is explained further in the [[Brahma Sutras]].

===Two examples from the Puranas===
The story of [[Markandeya]], who was saved from death by [[Siva]], illustrates that God's grace can overcome karma and death for His beloved devotee.[http://www.chennaionline.com/toursntravel/placesofworship/tirukkadavur01.asp]

The story of [[Ajamila]] in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]  
[http://www.geocities.com/profvk/VK2/SBAB8.html]
[http://www.chennaionline.com/festivalsnreligion/religion/religion33.asp],[http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/1148/k8.html] also illustrates the same point. Ajamila had committed many evil deeds during his life such as stealing, abandoning his wife and children, and marrying a prostitute. But at the moment of death, he involuntarily chanted the name of [[Narayana]] and therefore received [[moksha]] or union with God, and was saved from the messengers of [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]]. Ajamila was actually thinking of his youngest son, whose name was also Narayana. But the name of God has powerful effects, and Ajamila was forgiven for his great sins and attained salvation, despite his bad karma.

==Views of Hindu traditions on karma==
===Advaita Vedanta===
[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.<ref>Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38-41.</ref>

There is a passage from Swami Sivananda's translation of the [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] (4:6) illustrating this concept:

:''Two birds of beautiful plumage — inseparable friends — live on the same tree. Of these two one eats the sweet fruit while the other looks on without eating.'' 

In his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents [[Brahman]] or [[God]]. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten.

Swami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of [[social inequality]], fate, and universal [[suffering]] in the world. According to the [[Brahma Sutras]], individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the [[merit]] and demerit of souls.

In his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentalities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes [[reward]]s and [[punishment]]s only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.<ref>Sivananda, Swami. ''Adhikarana XII'', Sutras 34-36.</ref>

===Shaivism===
[[K. Thirugnana Sambantha]] writes about karma in his outline of [[Saivism]]. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require the existence of an external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition. However Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity. Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Shri Sambantha concludes that an intelligent [[Supreme Being]] with perfect wisdom and power ([[Shiva]], for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual. In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.<ref>Sambantha, Shri K. Thirugnana. [http://www.geocities.com/shivaperuman/main.html Explanation of God's role and Karma.] See Outline of Saivism, section on Karma.</ref>

[[Appaya Dikshita]], a Saivite theologian and proponent of Siva Advaita, states that Siva (God) only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma.<ref>Dasgupta, Surendranath, ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Volume V, ''The Southern Schools of Saivism'', p. 87</ref> Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone. Thus, many interpret the [[caste system]] in accordance with karma, as those with good deeds are born into a highly spiritual family (probably the ''brahmana'' caste).

Srikantha, another Saivite theologian, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds.<ref>Dasgupta, Surendranath. ''A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume V: The Southern Schools of Saivism'', pp. 87-89.</ref> Srikantha further believes that Siva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action.

[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] explains in the lexicon section of his book, ''Dancing with Siva'', that [[karma]] literally means "deed or act" and more broadly names the universal principle of [[cause and effect]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[reaction]] which governs all [[life]]. As he explains it, karma is not [[fate]], for man acts with [[free will]] creating his own [[destiny]]. The Vedas tell us that if we sow [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], we will reap goodness; if we sow [[evil]], we will reap evil. Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami further notes that karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determine our [[future]]. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction. Not all karmas rebound immediately. Some accumulate and return unexpectedly in this or other births.

===Vaishnavism===
[[Ramanuja]] attempts to fashion a solution to the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of [[jivas]] (human souls), and maintains that God is [[amala]] or without any stain of evil.

[[Madhva]], the founder of the [[Dvaita]] school, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil. Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas are not God's [[creation (theology)|creation]] as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with [[Vishnu]], although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.

According to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature. Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature.

Swami [[Tapasyananda]] further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (''jivas'') move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.<ref>Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta''.</ref>

Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of [[eternal]] [[damnation]]. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ([[Mukti-yogyas]]), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration ([[Nitya-samsarins]]), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal [[hell]] or [[Andhatamas]] ([[Tamo-yogyas]]). No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in [[universal salvation]]: that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if it is after millions of rebirths.

==Caste and karma==
As stated earlier, there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. Thus, many interpret the caste system in accordance with karma, as those with good deeds are born into a spiritual family, which is synonymous with the ''brahmana'' caste. However, [[Krishna]] said in the [[Gita]] that characteristics of a [[brahmin]] are determined by behavior, not by birth. A verse from the Gita illustrates this point: "The duties of [[Brahmins]], [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s as also of [[Sudras]], O scorcher of foes, are distributed according to the [[gunas]] (behavior) born of their own nature." (Chapter 18, verse 41)
