'''پاکستان''', officially the '''جمهوری اسلامی پاکستان''' ({{lang-ur|اسلامی جمہوریۂ پاکستان}}), is a [[country]] located in [[South Asia]] that overlaps with the [[Greater Middle East]]. It has a thousand-kilometre coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south and borders [[افغانستان]] and [[ايران]] to the west, [[هندوستان]] to the east and the [[چين]] in the far northeast.<ref name="kashmir">The [[Kashmir]] region is claimed by [[India]] and Pakistan. Both countries and China separately administer parts of the region with the Indian- and Pakistani-held areas defined by the [[Line of Control]]. The Pakistan&ndash;China border is not recognized by India.</ref>

Pakistan is the [[List of countries by population|sixth most populous country]] in the world, is home to the second [[List_of_cities_by_population|most populous  city]] in the world, and is the [[Islam by country|second most populous Muslim]] country. It was established as a modern state in 1947, as one of the two parts of the [[partition of India|partitioned]] British India, but the region has a long history of settlement and civilisation including the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. The region was invaded by [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Afghans]], [[Greeks]], [[Persians]], [[Arabs]], and was incorporated into the [[British Raj]] in the nineteenth century. Since [[Independence of Pakistan|independence]], Pakistan has experienced times of significant military and economic growth, and times of instability, with the loss of [[East Pakistan]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]]). Pakistan has the seventh largest armed forces in the world and is a [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|declared nuclear weapons state]].

{{Main|History of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Priest_King_of_Indus.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Pakistan is home to [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo-daro]], which was once a city of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], (3300 BCE-1700 BCE). Pictured is the city's famous "Priest King" statue.]]

The modern state of Pakistan was established on [[14 August]] [[1947]], but the region it encompasses has an extensive history that overlaps with the histories of [[Ancient India]], [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The region was a crossroads of historic trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]], and was settled over thousands of years by many groups, including [[Dravidians]], [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthians]] [[Kushans]], [[White Huns]], [[Afghans]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]] and [[Arab]]s; the region is often referred to as "a museum of races." Historian and geographer de Blij Muller characterized the historical embodiment of the land when he said, "If, as is so often said, [[Egypt]] is the gift of the [[Nile]], then Pakistan is the gift of the [[Indus]]." The earliest evidence of humans are pebble tools from the [[Soan Culture]]<ref name="soan">[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/pakistan University of Sheffield's archaeological research in Pakistan]</ref> in the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], dated from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. The [[Indus River|Indus region]] was the site of several ancient cultures including [[Mehrgarh]], one of the world's earliest known towns, and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] at [[Harrappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]].<ref name="indus_valley">[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/mohenjo_daro.html Minnesota State University page on Mohenjo-Daro]</ref> 

The Indus Valley Civilisation collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]], which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire<ref name="achaemenid">[http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/achaemenians.html Livius.org on the extent of the Achaemenid Empire]</ref> around 543 BCE, to [[Alexander the Great]]<ref name="plutarch">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/8.html#ref98 Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'']</ref> in 326 BCE and the [[Mauryan]] empire. The [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] founded by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius of Bactria]] included [[Gandhara]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under [[Menander I|Menander]],  establishing the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] period with advances in trade and culture. The city of [[Taxila]] (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning in ancient times - the remains of the city, located to the west of [[Islamabad]], are one of the country's major archaeological sites.

In 712 [[Common Era|CE]], the Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]<ref name="qasim">[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm Infinity Foundation's translation of the Chach-Nama]</ref> conquered [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]] in southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], setting the stage for several successive Muslim empires including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], the [[Muhammad of Ghor|Ghorid]] Kingdom, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. During this period [[Sufi]] missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to [[Islam]]. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Sikhs]] to exercise control over large areas until the [[British East India Company]]<ref name="east_india">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html Library of Congress study of Pakistan]</ref> gained ascendancy over South Asia. 
[[Image:Badshahi Mosque July 1 2005 pic32 by Ali Imran.jpg|thumb|200px|[[seventeenth century|17th Century]] [[Badshahi Masjid]] built by [[Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in [[Lahore]] ]]
The [[Indian War of Independence|War of Independence]] in 1857 was the region's last major armed struggle against the British Raj, and it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle led by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]. However, the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] rose to popularity in the late 1930's amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics. On [[29 December]] [[1930]], [[Allama Iqbal]]'s presidential address called for a separate Muslim state in northwest and eastern [[South Asia]]. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] espoused the ''[[Two Nation Theory]]'' and led the Muslim League to adopt the ''[[Lahore Resolution]]''<ref name="resolution">[http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/23%20march%202005/index.htm#d Jang.com page on the Lahore Resolution]</ref> of 1940, which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan.

[[Image:PAK1971.JPG|200px|thumb|The two wings of Pakistan in 1970; [[East Pakistan]] obtained independence in 1971 as [[Bangladesh]].]]
Pakistan was formed on [[14 August]] [[1947]] with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of [[South Asia]], separated by [[Hindu]]-majority India, and comprising the provinces of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[East Bengal]], the [[North-West Frontier Province]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|West Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Partition of India|partition of British India]] resulted in communal riots<ref name="1947riots">[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#India Estimates for the 1947 death toll]</ref> across India and Pakistan&mdash;millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and [[Sikhs]] moved to India. Disputes arose over several princely states including [[Jammu and Kashmir]] which led to the [[First Kashmir War]] (1948) ending with Pakistan and India each occupying large parts of the state. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a [[Dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The republic declared in 1958 was stalled by a [[coup d'etat]] by [[Ayub Khan]] (1958&ndash;69), who was president during a period of internal instability and a [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with India in 1965. His successor, [[Yahya Khan]] (1969&ndash;71) had to deal with the [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] which caused 500,000 deaths<ref name="cyclone">[http://nirapad.org/care_nirapad/Home/Magazine/chronology/currentissue/html/news8.html "Community participation in disaster management can reduce the losses"]</ref> in East Pakistan. Economic and political dissent in [[East Pakistan]] led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into [[civil war]]<ref name="1971war">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm 1971 war summary by BBC website]</ref> ([[Bangladesh Liberation War]]) and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of [[Bangladesh]].<ref name="bangladesh">[http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm US Country Studies article on the Bangladesh War]</ref>

Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], until he was deposed by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], who became the third military president. Pakistan's [[secular]] policies were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic [[Shariat]] legal code, which increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. With the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]], daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated power with [[Nawaz Sharif]], as the country's political and economic situation worsened. Military tensions in the [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]]<ref name="kargil">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/352995.stm Kargil conflict timeline on the BBC website]</ref> with India in 1999 was followed by a military [[coup]]<ref name="1999coup">[http://www.news.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/13/wcoo13.html Daily Telegraph (UK) article on the 1999 coup]</ref> in which General [[Pervez Musharraf]] assumed executive powers. In 2001, Musharraf became [[President of Pakistan|President]] after the resignation of [[Rafiq Tarar]]. After the 2002 parliamentary elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]], who was succeeded in the 2004 Prime-Ministerial election by [[Shaukat Aziz]].

The [[Muslim League]] formed Pakistan's first government under the leadership of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]. The Muslim League's leadership of Pakistani politics reduced significantly with the rise of other political parties, with the [[Pakistan People's Party]] in West Pakistan, and the [[Awami League]] in East Pakistan, which would ultimately lead to the creation of Bangladesh. The first [[Constitution of Pakistan]] was adopted in 1956, but was suspended in 1958 by [[Ayub Khan]]. The Constitution of 1973, suspended in 1977 by [[Zia-ul-Haq]], was re-instated in 1991 and is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of government. Pakistan is a [[federal republic]] with [[Islam]] as the state religion. The [[semi-presidential system]] includes a [[bicameral]] legislature consisting of a 100-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[President of Pakistan|President]] is the [[Head of State]] and the [[Commander in Chief]] of the Armed Forces and is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|electoral college]]. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly. Each province has a similar system of government with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or alliance becomes Chief Minister. Provincial Governors are selected by the Provincial Assemblies on the advice of the Chief Minister. 
[[Image:ParliamentHouse.jpg|thumb|200px|Parliament house in [[Islamabad]]]]

The [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistani military]] has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's history, with military presidents ruling from 1958&ndash;71, 1977&ndash;88 and from 1999 onwards. The leftist Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], emerged as a major political player during the 1970s. Under the military rule of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], Pakistan began a marked shift from the British-era secular politics and policies, to the adoption of [[Shariat]] and other laws based on Islam. During the 1980s, the anti-[[feudal]], pro-[[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]] [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of [[Sindh]] and particularly [[Karachi]]. The 1990s were characterized by coalition politics dominated by the PPP and a rejuvenated Muslim League. 

In the October 2002 general elections, the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q) won a [[plurality]] of National Assembly seats with the second-largest group being the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians]] (PPPP), a sub-party of the PPP. [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] of PML-Q emerged as Prime Minister but resigned on [[26 June]] [[2004]] and was replaced by PML-Q leader [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] as interim Prime Minister. On [[28 August]], [[2004]] the National Assembly voted 191 to 151 to elect the [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|Finance Minister]] and former [[Citibank]] Vice President [[Shaukat Aziz]] as Prime Minister. [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], a coalition of Islamic religious parties, won elections in [[North-West Frontier Province]], and increased their representation in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]].

[[Image:2006PresidentMusharaff&Bush.jpeg|thumb|200px|President Pervez Musharraf (right) with [[United States|U.S.]] President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] (left)]]
Pakistan is an active member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), the latter of which Pakistan has used as a forum for ''Enlightened Moderation'',<ref name="enlightened_moderation>[http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/EnlightenedModeration.aspx President Musharraf on Enlightened Moderation]</ref> a plan to promote a [[renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] in the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a member of the major regional organisations of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]] (ECO). In the past, Pakistan has had mixed relations with the United States especially in the early 1950s when Pakistan was the United States' "most allied ally in Asia"<ref name="mostallied">[http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2583/newsletter_info_sub_list.htm?section=Pakistan%3A%20The%20Most%20Allied%20Ally%20in%20Asia Pakistan: The Most Allied Ally in Asia]</ref> and a member of both the [[Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) and the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO). During the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] in the 1980s Pakistan was a crucial US ally, but relations soured in the 1990s, when sanctions were applied by the US over suspicions of Pakistan's nuclear activities. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on Terrorism]] have seen an improvement in US&ndash;Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its support of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Kabul]]. In January 2004, founder of Pakistani nuclear program [[A. Q. Khan]] confessed of nuclear proliferation to [[Libya]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. On [[5 February]] [[2004]], the president [[Pervez Musharraf]], announced that he had pardoned A. Q. Khan.

Pakistan has long had troubled relations with [[Relations between India and Pakistan|neighbouring India]]. The long-running dispute over [[Kashmir]] resulted in full fledged wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]]. Civil war in 1971 flared into the simultaneous [[Bangladeshi Liberation War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Pakistan conducted nuclear weapon tests in 1998 to counterbalance India's [[Pokhran-II|nuclear tests]] and became the only Muslim [[declared nuclear states|nuclear weapons state]]. The relations with India are steadily improving following peace initiatives in 2002. Pakistan maintains close [[economic]], [[military]] and [[political]] relationships with the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

Pakistan also faces instability in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], where some tribal leaders support the [[Taliban]]. Pakistan has had to deploy its army in these regions to suppress the local unrest, although a recently declared ceasefire between the tribal leaders and the Pakistani government will bring back the significantly needed stability to the region.<ref name="local_unrest">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C12%5C31%5Cstory_31-12-2005_pg7_29 'Taliban' gain sway in tribal region]. <u>Daily Times</u>. [[31 December]] [[2005]].</ref>
Additionally, the [[country]] has long faced instability in its largest [[province]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The army was deployed to fight a serious [[insurgency]] within the province from 1973&ndash;76. Social stability resumed after [[Rahimuddin Khan]] was appointed [[martial law administrator]] beginning in 1977. After relative peace throughout the 1980s and 1990s, some influential Baloch tribal leaders once again started a separatist movement after Pervez Musharraf took over in 1999.

[[Image:Sub Pakistan.png|thumb|200px|Provinces and territories of Pakistan]]
Pakistan is a [[federation]]<ref name="federation">[http://www.nrb.gov.pk/constitutional_and_legal/constitution/part1.notes.html#1 The Constitutional basis of the Federation of Pakistan]</ref> of four provinces, a capital territory and federally administered tribal areas. Pakistan exercises ''de facto'' jurisdiction over the western parts of the [[Kashmir]] region, organised as two separate political entities ([[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Northern Areas]]), which are also claimed by India. In 2001 the federal government abolished the third tier of government ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) in favour of the former fourth tier districts. The provinces and the capital territory are subdivided into a total of [[Districts of Pakistan|107 districts]] which contain numerous [[tehsils]] and local governments. The tribal areas comprise seven tribal agencies and six small frontier regions detached from neighbouring districts whilst Azad Kashmir comprises seven districts and Northern Areas comprises six districts.

{{main|Geography of Pakistan}}
[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|200px|The world's second-highest mountain, [[K2]]]]
Pakistan covers 880,254 square kilometres (339,867 sq mi.), approximately the combined land areas of [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], with its eastern regions located on the [[Indian plate|Indian tectonic plate]] and the western and northern regions on the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Eurasian landplate]]. Apart from the 1,046&nbsp;kilometre<!--Format per WP:MOSNUM --> (650&nbsp;mi) [[Arabian Sea]] coastline, Pakistan's land borders total 6,774&nbsp;kilometres&mdash;2,430&nbsp;kilometres (1,509&nbsp;mi) with Afghanistan to the northwest, 523&nbsp;kilometres (325&nbsp;mi) with China to the northeast, 2,912&nbsp;kilometres (1,809&nbsp;mi) with India to the east and 909&nbsp;kilometres (565&nbsp;mi) with Iran to the southwest.<ref name="cia_world_factbook"> [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/pk.html CIA World Factbook] URL accessed on [[March 20]], [[2006]]</ref>

The different types of natural features range from the sandy beaches, [[lagoon]]s, and [[mangrove]] swamps of the southern coast to preserved moist temperate forests and the icy peaks of the [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]] and [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in the north. There are an estimated 108 peaks above 7,000&nbsp;metres (23,000&nbsp;ft) high that are covered in snow and [[glaciers]]. Five of the mountains in Pakistan (including [[K2]] and [[Nanga Parbat]]) are over 8,000&nbsp;metres (26,000&nbsp;ft). Linking [[India]]n-controlled Kashmir to the [[Northern Areas|Northern Areas of Pakistan]] and running the length of the country is the [[Indus River]] with its many tributaries. To the west of the Indus are the dry, hilly deserts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]; to the east are the rolling sand dunes of the [[Thar Desert]]. Most areas of Punjab and parts of Sindh are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.

The climate varies as much as the scenery, with cold winters and hot summers in the north and a mild climate in the south, moderated by the influence of the ocean. The central parts have extremely hot summers with temperatures rising to 45&nbsp;°C (113&nbsp;°F), followed by very cold winters, often falling below freezing. There is very little rainfall ranging from less than 250&nbsp;millimetres to more than 1,250&nbsp;millimetres (9.8&ndash;49.2&nbsp;in), mostly brought by the unreliable south-westerly [[monsoon]] winds during the late summer. Water shortages have been eased by the construction of dams on the rivers and the drilling of water wells in many drier areas.

== Flora and fauna ==
[[Image:Hunza by jayzee.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] valley in northern Pakistan. &mdash; Agricultural and scenic]]
The wide variety of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows for a wide variety of wild animals and birds. The forests range from [[coniferous]] [[alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as spruce, pine, and [[deodar cedar]] in the northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees such as the mulberry-type Shisham in the Sulaiman range in the south. The western hills have [[juniper]] and [[tamarisk]] as well as coarse grasses and scrub plants. Along the coast are [[mangrove]] forests which form much of the coastal wetlands.

In the south, there are crocodiles in the murky waters at the mouth of the Indus River whilst on the banks of the river, there are boars, deer, [[porcupine]]s, and small rodents. In the sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are found jackals, hyenas, wild cats, panthers, and leopards while the clear blue skies abound with hawks, falcons, and eagles. In the southwestern deserts are rare Asiatic cheetahs. In the northern mountains are a variety of endangered animals including [[Marco Polo sheep]], [[Urial|Urial sheep]], [[Markhor]] and [[Ibex]] goats, [[Asiatic black bear|black]] and [[Brown bear|brown]] Himalayan bears, and the rare [[Snow Leopard]]. During August 2006, Pakistan donated an orphaned snow leopard cub called [[Leo]] to USA. <ref name="Pakistan donates snow leopard to USA">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4776031.stm Leo the snow leopard is US-bound]</ref> Another rare species is the blind [[Indus River Dolphin]] of which there are believed to be about 1,000 remaining, protected in two major sanctuaries. In recent years the number of wild animals being killed for fur and leather trading led to a new law banning the hunting of wild animals and birds and the establishment of several wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves.<ref name="wildlife">[http://www.wildlifeofpakistan.com/wildlifesanctuarygamereservesmap.htm Wildlife Sanctuaries of Pakistan]</ref>

{{main|Economy of Pakistan}}
[[Image:KarachiFinancial.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karachi]] is the financial capital of Pakistan.]] 
Pakistan is a rapidly [[developing country]] which has faced a number of challenges on both political and economic fronts. Despite being a very poor country in 1947, Pakistan's economic growth rate was better than the global average during the subsequent four decades, but imprudent policies led to a slowdown in the late 1990s.<ref name="econ_1990s">[http://www.pakistanstudies-aips.org/en/economy.htm Pakistan Studies] URL accessed [[March 21]], [[2006]]</ref> Recently, wide-ranging economic reforms have resulted in a stronger economic outlook and accelerated growth especially in the [[manufacturing]] and [[financial services]] [[sector]]s. There has been great improvement in the [[foreign exchange]] position and rapid growth in [[hard currency]] reserves in recent years. The 2005 estimate of foreign debt was close to US$40 billion. However, this has decreased in recent years with assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and debt-relief from the United States.<ref name="cia_world_factbook" /> Pakistan's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2005 was estimated at US$404.6 billion and its [[per capita]] GDP was US$2,400. Pakistan's GDP growth rates have seen a steady increase over the last 5 years. In 2001, the country's GDP growth rate was at 1.8%, but in the fiscal year that ended [[June 30]], [[2005]], the nominal GDP growth rate peaked at 8.4%. This put Pakistan's growth rate as the second-highest after China, among the ten most populous countries in the world.<ref name="growth">[http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&refer=columnist_mukherjee&sid=aiSFuvMKI2Gw Bloomberg.com article: China's New Growth Challenger Is Pakistan]</ref> However, inflationary pressures and a below par savings rate, among other economic factors, would make it difficult to sustain a high growth rate.<ref>[http://www.adb.org/Media/Articles/2006/9638-regional-GDP-table/ Country-by-Country Growth and Forecasts] - [[Asian Development Bank]], [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C05%5C01%5Cstory_1-5-2006_pg3_5 VIEW: Is GDP growth sustainable?] - [[Daily Times]] </ref> The growth of non-agricultural sectors has changed the structure of the economy, and agriculture now only accounts for roughly 20% of the GDP. The [[service]] sector accounts for 53% of the country's GDP with [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade forming 30% of this sector. In recent times, the [[Karachi Stock Exchange]] has soared, along with most of the world's [[emerging markets]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Major_ethnic_groups_of_Pakistan_in_1980.jpg|thumb|200px|Major Ethnic Groups in Pakistan and surrounding areas, 1980]]
Pakistan has an estimated population of 165,803,560, as of April 2006.<ref name="US Census Bureau">[http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idbprint.html International Data Base] U.S. Census Bureau. URL accessed on [[5 May]] [[2006]].</ref> Pakistan has the world's sixth largest population, more than [[Russia]], but less than [[Brazil]]; because of Pakistan's high growth rate, it is expected to surpass [[Brazil]] in population in the year 2020. Population projections for Pakistan are relatively difficult because of the apparent differences in the accuracy of each census and the inconsistencies between various surveys related to fertility rate, but it is likely that the rate of growth peaked in 1980s.<ref name="population">[http://www.gfeeney.com/pubs/2003-pakistan-fertility-2/2003-pakistan-fertility-2.pdf Feeney and Alam, 2003]</ref> The population was estimated at 162,400,000<ref name="prb">[http://www.prb.org/pdf05/05WorldDataSheet_Eng.pdf Population Reference Bureau's 2005 World Data Sheet]</ref> on [[July 1]], [[2005]], with a fertility rate of 34 per thousand, a death rate of 10 per thousand and the rate of natural increase was 2.4%. Pakistan also had a high infant mortality rate of 85 per thousand births.Non-governmental and international sources report that Pakistans current population is estimated to be 170 to 190 million{{citation needed}}.

[[Urdu]] is the [[Languages of Pakistan|national language]] and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Pakistan, but [[English language|English]] is the [[official language]] used in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] and widely used by corporate businesses, the educated urban elite and most universities. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is spoken by over 60 million people, but has no official recognition in the country.<ref name=punjabi>
Pakistanis represent a variety of races and ethnic groups, mostly of [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] stock and hence quite distinct from the aboriginal peoples who inhabit this part of the [[Indian Sub-Continent]]. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pnb Ethnologue Western Punjabi]</ref> The large majority of Pakistanis belong to the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] ethnic group although there are a substantial number of [[Iranian peoples|Indo-Iranians]] and smaller numbers of [[Dravidians]]. These major ethnic groups are further broken down into several smaller ethnic groups - [[Punjabis]] (44.68)% of the population, [[Pashtuns]] (15.42%), [[Sindhis]]  (14.1%), [[Seraikis]] (10.53%), [[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]]s (7.57%), [[Balochis]] (3.57%) and others (4.66%).

Census data <ref name="census">[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_mother_tongue.pdf Census results for languages of Pakistan]</ref> indicates that 96% of the population are [[Islam in Pakistan|Muslim]]s of whom nearly 80% are [[Sunni Muslims]] and 19% are [[Shi'a Muslims]]. Pakistan has the second highest Shia population in the world, after Iran, and more than India or Iraq. <ref name="Shia Population">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Population Census results for shia population in Pakistan]</ref> The remainder comprises of [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christians]] and [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindus]], [[Jew]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Ahmadi]]s, and [[Animist]]s (mainly the [[Kalasha of Chitral]]). A few [[Buddhist]]s are included in Pakistani statistics; however, these live in Indian administered [[Ladakh]] which Pakistan claims along with the rest of [[Kashmir]]. 

The demographics of Pakistan were significantly influenced in 1947 by the movement of Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. As of 2005, over three million refugees (approximately 81.5% being ethnic [[Pashtuns]]) remain in Pakistan as a result of the wars in [[Afghanistan]], according to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], with 83% of the refugees reporting their intent to permanently settle in Pakistan.<ref name="afghan refugees census">[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=SUBSITES&page=SUBSITES&id=434fdc702 UNHCR Statistical Summary Report: Census of Afghans in Pakistan]</ref>

== Society and culture ==
{{main|Culture of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Faisal masjid isla galleryfull.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[King Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], one of the largest in the world]]
[[Image:Mainboulevard1cg.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Lahore]] is the 2nd largest city of Pakistan.]]
[[Image:Shalamar Garden July 14 2005-South wall pavilion with fountains.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] of [[Lahore]]]]

Pakistan has a rich and unique culture that has preserved established traditions throughout history. Prior to the arrival of Islam, many Punjabis and Sindhis were Hindu and Buddhist but this changed during the expansion of Islam by the [[Ummayad]] General [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and others. Many cultural practices, foods, monuments, and shrines were inherited from the rule of Muslim [[Mughal]] and [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] emperors including the national dress of [[shalwar kameez|Shalwar Qameez]]. Women wear brightly coloured Shalwar Qameez, while men often wear solid-coloured Shalwar Qameez, usually with a [[sherwani]] or [[achkan]] (long coat) that goes over the Shalwar Qameez.

The rich variety of [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani music]] ranges from diverse provincial folk music and traditional styles such as [[Qawwali]] and [[Ghazal|Ghazal Gayaki]] to modern forms fusing traditional and western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and western music by the renowned [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]]. Other major [[Ghazal]] singers include [[Mehdi Hassan]], [[Ghulam Ali]], [[Farida Khanum]], [[Tahira Syed]], [[Abida Parveen]] and [[Iqbal Bano]]. The arrival of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] refugees in the western provinces has rekindled [[Pashto]] and [[Persians|Persian]] music and established [[Peshawar]] as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution centre for Afghan music abroad. Until the 1990s, the state-owned [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) and [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] were the dominant media outlets, but there are now numerous [[List of Pakistani TV and radio Channels|private television channels]] such as [[Geo TV]], [[Indus News|Indus TV]], [[Hum TV|Hum]] and [[ARY Group|ARY]]. Various American, European, and Asian television channels and movies are available to a majority of the Pakistani population via [[cable TV|cable]] and [[satellite television]]. There are also small indigenous movie industries based in Lahore and Peshawar (often referred to as [[Lollywood]] and [[Pollywood]]). Although [[Bollywood]] movies are banned, Indian film stars are popular in Pakistan.

Pakistani society is largely [[multilingual]] and predominantly [[Muslim]], with high regard for traditional family values, although urban families have grown into a [[nuclear family]] system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system. Recent decades have seen the emergence of a middle class in cities like [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Sukkur]] and [[Peshawar]] that wish to move in a more liberal direction,<ref name="secular_middle">Beinart, Peter. "Understate". <u>The New Republic Online</u>. July 01, 2002.</ref> as opposed to the northwestern regions bordering Afghanistan that remain highly conservative and dominated by centuries-old regional [[Tribal Areas of Pakistan|tribal]] customs. Increasing [[globalization]] has increased the influence of "Western culture" with Pakistan ranking 46<sup>th</sup> on the Kearney/FP Globalization Index.<ref name="globalization">[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/issue_marapr_2004/countrydetail.php?country=Pakistan Kearney Foreign Policy Globalization Index]</ref> There are an approximated four million Pakistanis living abroad,<ref name="expats">http://www.pakistaneconomist.com/database1/cover/c2000-50.asp URL accessed [[March 17]], [[2006]]</ref> with close to a half-million [[expatriate]]s living in the United States<ref name="expats_us">Ahmed, Fasih.

Tourism is a growing industry in Pakistan, based on its diverse cultures, peoples and landscapes. Ancient civilization ruins such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]] and [[Taxila]], to the Himalayan hill stations attract those interested in field sports and winter sports. Pakistan is home to several [[Mountain ranges of Pakistan|mountain peaks]] over 7000m, which attracts adventurers and mountaineers from around the world, especially [[K2]]<ref name="mountains">[http://www.tourism.gov.pk/mountain.html PTDC page on mountaineering]</ref>. The northern parts of Pakistan have many old fortresses, towers and other architecture as well as the [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] and [[Chitral]] valleys, the latter being home to the small pre-Islamic [[Animist]] [[Kalasha]] community who claim descent from the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] is the site of Alexander's [[battle of the Hydaspes River|battle]] on the [[Jhelum River]] and the historic city [[Lahore]], Pakistan's cultural capital with many examples of [[Mughal]] architecture such as the [[Badshahi Masjid]],  [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]], [[Tomb of Jahangir]] and the [[Lahore Fort]].

[[Image:Hazuri_Bagh.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] [[Hazuri Bagh]] in [[Lahore]], an example of Mughal era Islamic architecture.]]
There are many holidays and festivals celebrated annually in Pakistan. While Pakistan is an Islamic nation, there are also several secular holidays including Pakistan Day ([[23 March]]), Independence Day ([[14 August]]), Defence of Pakistan Day ([[6 September]]), Pakistan Air Force Day ([[7 September]]), the anniversaries of the birth ([[25 December]]) and death ([[11 September]]) of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Quaid-e-Azam]], [[Allama Iqbal]] ([[9  November]]) and the birth ([[30 July]]) and death ([[8 July]]) of [[Fatima Jinnah|Madar-e-Millat]]. [[Labour Day]] (also known as [[May Day]]) is also observed in Pakistan on [[1 May]]. 

Several important festivals are celebrated by Pakistani Muslims during the year, dependent on the [[Islamic calendar]]. [[Ramadan]], the ninth month of the calendar, is characterised by daytime fasting for 29 or 30 days and is followed by the festival of [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. In a second festival, [[Eid ul-Adha]], an animal is sacrificed in remembrance of the actions of [[Abraham]] and the meat is shared with friends, family, and the less fortunate. Both Eid festivals are public holidays, serving as opportunities for people to visit family and friends, and for children to receive new clothes, presents, and sweets. Some Muslims celebrate [[Milad al-Nabi|Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]], the birthday of the prophet [[Muhammad]], in the third month of the calendar ([[Rabi' al-Awwal]]). [[Shi'a Islam|Shia Muslims]] mark the [[Day of Ashurah]] on the 9th and 10th days of the first month ([[Muharram]]) to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Husayn bin Ali]], (the grandson of prophet [[Muhammad]]). 

Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians in Pakistan also celebrate their own festivals and holidays. [[Sikhs]] come from across the world to visit several holy sites in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], including the shrine of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], at Hassan Abdal in the [[Attock District]], and his birthplace, at [[Nankana Sahib]]. There are also several regional and local festivals, such as the [[Punjabi]] festival of [[Basant]], which marks the start of spring and is celebrated by kite flying.

== Sports ==
{{main|Sports in Pakistan}}
[[Image:Rawalpindi_cricket.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Rawalpindi]] cricket stadium]]
The official and national sport of Pakistan is [[field hockey]], although [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[cricket]] are also very popular. The [[Pakistani cricket team|national cricket team]] has won the [[Cricket World Cup]] once (in [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]]), were runners-up once (in [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]]) and co-hosted the games twice (in [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]]). The team has also won the [[Australasia Cup]] in 1986, 1990, and 1994. Pakistan has been always in the forefront when it comes to the game of [[squash]]. [[Jahangir Khan]] and [[Jansher Khan]] are some of the well known stars of the game.

At an international level, Pakistan has competed many times at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in field hockey, [[boxing]], [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[swimming]], and [[shooting]]. Pakistan's medal tally remains at a mere 10 medals (3 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze) while at the Commonwealth games and Asian Games it stands at 61 medals and 182 medals respectively. Hockey is the sport that Pakistan has been most successful at the Olympics, with three gold medals ([[Hockey at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Hockey at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Hockey at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]). Pakistan has also won the [[Hockey World Cup]] four times (1971, 1978, 1982, 1994).<ref name="hockey">[http://www.bharatiyahockey.org/olympics/2004/pakistan.htm Bharatiya Hockey]</ref> Pakistan has hosted several international competitions, including the [[South Asian Federation Games|SAF Games]] in 1989 and 2004.

[[A1 Grand Prix]] racing is also becoming popular with the entry of a [[A1 Team Pakistan|Pakistani team]] in the 2005 season. The [[Tour de Pakistan]], modeled on the [[Tour de France]], is an annual cycling competition that covers the length and breadth of Pakistan. Recently, [[football]] has grown in popularity across the country, where traditionally it had been played almost exclusively in the western province of Balochistan.
