'''پاکستان''', officially the '''جمهوری اسلامی پاکستان''' ({{lang-ur|اسلامی جمہوریۂ پاکستان}}), is a [[country]] located in [[South Asia]] that overlaps with the [[Greater Middle East]]. It has a thousand-kilometre coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south and borders [[افغانستان]] and [[ايران]] to the west, [[هندوستان]] to the east and the [[چين]] in the far northeast.<ref name="kashmir">The [[Kashmir]] region is claimed by [[India]] and Pakistan. Both countries and China separately administer parts of the region with the Indian- and Pakistani-held areas defined by the [[Line of Control]]. The Pakistan&ndash;China border is not recognized by India.</ref>

د "''پاکستان''" نوم ([[IPA]]: {{IPA|/paːkɪst̪aːn/}}) په اردو او فارسي ژبو کې "د پاکو خلکو خاوره" مانا لري. دا نوم د چوهدري رحمت علي لخوا په ۱۹۳۳ زېږيز کال کې د لومړي ځل لپاره په يوې رساله کې د ''[[اوس او يا هېڅکله]]'' تر سرليک لاندې خپور کړ<ref name="pamphlet">[http://www.zyworld.com/slam33/non.htm Text of the ''Now or Never pamphlet'', issued on [[January 28]], [[1933]]]</ref> as an [[acronym]] of the names of the "Muslim homelands" of western India &mdash; '''P''' for [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], '''A''' for ''Afghania'' (the [[Pashtun|Afghan (Pashtun)]] areas in the Northwest Frontier Province), '''K''' for [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir]], '''S''' for [[Sindh]] and '''tan''' for [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. An '''i''' was later added to the [[English language|English]] rendition of the name to ease pronunciation. Officially, the nation was founded as the ''Dominion of Pakistan'' in 1947, and was renamed as the ''Islamic Republic of Pakistan'' in 1957.

{{main|Geography of Pakistan}}
[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|200px|The world's second-highest mountain, [[K2]]]]
Pakistan covers 880,254 square kilometres (339,867 sq mi.), approximately the combined land areas of [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], with its eastern regions located on the [[Indian plate|Indian tectonic plate]] and the western and northern regions on the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Eurasian landplate]]. Apart from the 1,046&nbsp;kilometre<!--Format per WP:MOSNUM --> (650&nbsp;mi) [[Arabian Sea]] coastline, Pakistan's land borders total 6,774&nbsp;kilometres&mdash;2,430&nbsp;kilometres (1,509&nbsp;mi) with Afghanistan to the northwest, 523&nbsp;kilometres (325&nbsp;mi) with China to the northeast, 2,912&nbsp;kilometres (1,809&nbsp;mi) with India to the east and 909&nbsp;kilometres (565&nbsp;mi) with Iran to the southwest.<ref name="cia_world_factbook"> [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/pk.html CIA World Factbook] URL accessed on [[March 20]], [[2006]]</ref>

The different types of natural features range from the sandy beaches, [[lagoon]]s, and [[mangrove]] swamps of the southern coast to preserved moist temperate forests and the icy peaks of the [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]] and [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in the north. There are an estimated 108 peaks above 7,000&nbsp;metres (23,000&nbsp;ft) high that are covered in snow and [[glaciers]]. Five of the mountains in Pakistan (including [[K2]] and [[Nanga Parbat]]) are over 8,000&nbsp;metres (26,000&nbsp;ft). Linking [[India]]n-controlled Kashmir to the [[Northern Areas|Northern Areas of Pakistan]] and running the length of the country is the [[Indus River]] with its many tributaries. To the west of the Indus are the dry, hilly deserts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]; to the east are the rolling sand dunes of the [[Thar Desert]]. Most areas of Punjab and parts of Sindh are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.

The climate varies as much as the scenery, with cold winters and hot summers in the north and a mild climate in the south, moderated by the influence of the ocean. The central parts have extremely hot summers with temperatures rising to 45&nbsp;°C (113&nbsp;°F), followed by very cold winters, often falling below freezing. There is very little rainfall ranging from less than 250&nbsp;millimetres to more than 1,250&nbsp;millimetres (9.8&ndash;49.2&nbsp;in), mostly brought by the unreliable south-westerly [[monsoon]] winds during the late summer. Water shortages have been eased by the construction of dams on the rivers and the drilling of water wells in many drier areas.

== Flora and fauna ==
[[Image:Hunza by jayzee.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] valley in northern Pakistan. &mdash; Agricultural and scenic]]
The wide variety of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows for a wide variety of wild animals and birds. The forests range from [[coniferous]] [[alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as spruce, pine, and [[deodar cedar]] in the northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees such as the mulberry-type Shisham in the Sulaiman range in the south. The western hills have [[juniper]] and [[tamarisk]] as well as coarse grasses and scrub plants. Along the coast are [[mangrove]] forests which form much of the coastal wetlands.

In the south, there are crocodiles in the murky waters at the mouth of the Indus River whilst on the banks of the river, there are boars, deer, [[porcupine]]s, and small rodents. In the sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are found jackals, hyenas, wild cats, panthers, and leopards while the clear blue skies abound with hawks, falcons, and eagles. In the southwestern deserts are rare Asiatic cheetahs. In the northern mountains are a variety of endangered animals including [[Marco Polo sheep]], [[Urial|Urial sheep]], [[Markhor]] and [[Ibex]] goats, [[Asiatic black bear|black]] and [[Brown bear|brown]] Himalayan bears, and the rare [[Snow Leopard]]. During August 2006, Pakistan donated an orphaned snow leopard cub called [[Leo]] to USA. <ref name="Pakistan donates snow leopard to USA">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4776031.stm Leo the snow leopard is US-bound]</ref> Another rare species is the blind [[Indus River Dolphin]] of which there are believed to be about 1,000 remaining, protected in two major sanctuaries. In recent years the number of wild animals being killed for fur and leather trading led to a new law banning the hunting of wild animals and birds and the establishment of several wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves.<ref name="wildlife">[http://www.wildlifeofpakistan.com/wildlifesanctuarygamereservesmap.htm Wildlife Sanctuaries of Pakistan]</ref>

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Pakistan}}
[[Image:KarachiFinancial.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karachi]] is the financial capital of Pakistan.]] 
Pakistan is a rapidly [[developing country]] which has faced a number of challenges on both political and economic fronts. Despite being a very poor country in 1947, Pakistan's economic growth rate was better than the global average during the subsequent four decades, but imprudent policies led to a slowdown in the late 1990s.<ref name="econ_1990s">[http://www.pakistanstudies-aips.org/en/economy.htm Pakistan Studies] URL accessed [[March 21]], [[2006]]</ref> Recently, wide-ranging economic reforms have resulted in a stronger economic outlook and accelerated growth especially in the [[manufacturing]] and [[financial services]] [[sector]]s. There has been great improvement in the [[foreign exchange]] position and rapid growth in [[hard currency]] reserves in recent years. The 2005 estimate of foreign debt was close to US$40 billion. However, this has decreased in recent years with assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and debt-relief from the United States.<ref name="cia_world_factbook" /> Pakistan's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2005 was estimated at US$404.6 billion and its [[per capita]] GDP was US$2,400. Pakistan's GDP growth rates have seen a steady increase over the last 5 years. In 2001, the country's GDP growth rate was at 1.8%, but in the fiscal year that ended [[June 30]], [[2005]], the nominal GDP growth rate peaked at 8.4%. This put Pakistan's growth rate as the second-highest after China, among the ten most populous countries in the world.<ref name="growth">[http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&refer=columnist_mukherjee&sid=aiSFuvMKI2Gw Bloomberg.com article: China's New Growth Challenger Is Pakistan]</ref> However, inflationary pressures and a below par savings rate, among other economic factors, would make it difficult to sustain a high growth rate.<ref>[http://www.adb.org/Media/Articles/2006/9638-regional-GDP-table/ Country-by-Country Growth and Forecasts] - [[Asian Development Bank]], [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C05%5C01%5Cstory_1-5-2006_pg3_5 VIEW: Is GDP growth sustainable?] - [[Daily Times]] </ref> The growth of non-agricultural sectors has changed the structure of the economy, and agriculture now only accounts for roughly 20% of the GDP. The [[service]] sector accounts for 53% of the country's GDP with [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade forming 30% of this sector. In recent times, the [[Karachi Stock Exchange]] has soared, along with most of the world's [[emerging markets]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Major_ethnic_groups_of_Pakistan_in_1980.jpg|thumb|200px|Major Ethnic Groups in Pakistan and surrounding areas, 1980]]
Pakistan has an estimated population of 165,803,560, as of April 2006.<ref name="US Census Bureau">[http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idbprint.html International Data Base] U.S. Census Bureau. URL accessed on [[5 May]] [[2006]].</ref> Pakistan has the world's sixth largest population, more than [[Russia]], but less than [[Brazil]]; because of Pakistan's high growth rate, it is expected to surpass [[Brazil]] in population in the year 2020. Population projections for Pakistan are relatively difficult because of the apparent differences in the accuracy of each census and the inconsistencies between various surveys related to fertility rate, but it is likely that the rate of growth peaked in 1980s.<ref name="population">[http://www.gfeeney.com/pubs/2003-pakistan-fertility-2/2003-pakistan-fertility-2.pdf Feeney and Alam, 2003]</ref> The population was estimated at 162,400,000<ref name="prb">[http://www.prb.org/pdf05/05WorldDataSheet_Eng.pdf Population Reference Bureau's 2005 World Data Sheet]</ref> on [[July 1]], [[2005]], with a fertility rate of 34 per thousand, a death rate of 10 per thousand and the rate of natural increase was 2.4%. Pakistan also had a high infant mortality rate of 85 per thousand births.Non-governmental and international sources report that Pakistans current population is estimated to be 170 to 190 million{{citation needed}}.

[[Urdu]] is the [[Languages of Pakistan|national language]] and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Pakistan, but [[English language|English]] is the [[official language]] used in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] and widely used by corporate businesses, the educated urban elite and most universities. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is spoken by over 60 million people, but has no official recognition in the country.<ref name=punjabi>
Pakistanis represent a variety of races and ethnic groups, mostly of [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] stock and hence quite distinct from the aboriginal peoples who inhabit this part of the [[Indian Sub-Continent]]. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pnb Ethnologue Western Punjabi]</ref> The large majority of Pakistanis belong to the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] ethnic group although there are a substantial number of [[Iranian peoples|Indo-Iranians]] and smaller numbers of [[Dravidians]]. These major ethnic groups are further broken down into several smaller ethnic groups - [[Punjabis]] (44.68)% of the population, [[Pashtuns]] (15.42%), [[Sindhis]]  (14.1%), [[Seraikis]] (10.53%), [[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]]s (7.57%), [[Balochis]] (3.57%) and others (4.66%).

Census data <ref name="census">[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_mother_tongue.pdf Census results for languages of Pakistan]</ref> indicates that 96% of the population are [[Islam in Pakistan|Muslim]]s of whom nearly 80% are [[Sunni Muslims]] and 19% are [[Shi'a Muslims]]. Pakistan has the second highest Shia population in the world, after Iran, and more than India or Iraq. <ref name="Shia Population">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Population Census results for shia population in Pakistan]</ref> The remainder comprises of [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christians]] and [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindus]], [[Jew]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Ahmadi]]s, and [[Animist]]s (mainly the [[Kalasha of Chitral]]). A few [[Buddhist]]s are included in Pakistani statistics; however, these live in Indian administered [[Ladakh]] which Pakistan claims along with the rest of [[Kashmir]]. 

The demographics of Pakistan were significantly influenced in 1947 by the movement of Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. As of 2005, over three million refugees (approximately 81.5% being ethnic [[Pashtuns]]) remain in Pakistan as a result of the wars in [[Afghanistan]], according to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], with 83% of the refugees reporting their intent to permanently settle in Pakistan.<ref name="afghan refugees census">[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=SUBSITES&page=SUBSITES&id=434fdc702 UNHCR Statistical Summary Report: Census of Afghans in Pakistan]</ref>
