برطانوى دائرة المعارف ( Encyclopeadia Britannica) دمسيحيت تعريف پدىډول كړي دى:
هغه دين  چى خپل  اصل د الناصريي ( Nazaareth ( داوسيونكى يسوع  خواته كوى ،څوك  چى د الله  غوره شوى بولى.
( برطانوى  دائرة المعارف  د مسيحت  مقاله  ج،۵ صفحه 693).
د عيسوت دغه تعريف  ډير لنډ دى خو ( الفريا، اى ، جاروى)  په څه  تفصيل  او بيان سره راخيستى ، نوموړي  د دينونو او اخلاقو په دائرة المعارف كى وائى:
( د مسيحيت په تعريف   كى ويلى شو چى  دغه يو اخلاقى تاريخى، كونى ،د يو والى او په كفارى ايمان لرونكى يو دين دى چى د انسان اوڅښتن ترمنځه ټراو د مسيح  شخصيت او كردار باندى  تړل  شوى).
بيا  ( جاروى) د دغه تعريف  هره برخه  په پوره تفصيل  او شرحى  سره راخيستى : د (اخلاص دين ) نه د نوموړي مطلب  ، هغه  دين دى چي  خپلو تړاولرونكو ئى
د نيوى   مقصدته  رسيدنه د عبادت او فداكارى  په لياره نه ښايي او يوازينى  هدف ئى  بشپړ  ډول روحاني برى  او د الله  رضا حاصلول  دى.
( تاريخى دين)  نه  مطلب دادى د كړو اوفكرونه مدار  د يو تاريخى شخصيت چى ( مسيح عليه  السلام)دي په  مدار څرخيږي.
او د نوموړي  خبره  او كړڼ لاره  ددى دين ترټولو اوچته واك او پاى دى.
د كونى نه معنى  داده چى  تر يو خاص جنس  او نژاد نه خاص  كيږي  ځكه  دايو نړيوال بلنه  ده .
جاروى مسيحيت  د يو والى (  Montheist  )  دين بللى ځكه چى  دڅښتن  په يووالى  ايمان لري، سره لدى  چى پدى درى اقانيمو( Persons  )  باندى عقيده ولاړه ده .
نوموړي وائى:
كه څه هم په  عام ډول مسيحيان د تثليت (1) په عقيده ياپه واضح ډول د توحيد فى التثليت _ باندى عقيده لرل  په خطرناكه ډول د دريو خدايانوعبادت ته  ورنژدى كوى، مګر مسيحى دين په روحى اعتبار د توحيد دين دى.
پورتى  تعريف  دمسيحيت  د دين يوه بله مهمه ځانګړتيامونږ ته ښايي  چى هغه په كفاره (Atonement )  باندى  ايمان دى. ( جاروى)  د تعريف پدى برخه كى وائى:
د خداى او بنده ترمنځه   چى  كومه تړاو بايدوى  د مسيحيانو په عقيده  هغه  د ګناه  په ذريعه  زيانمنه شوى، او لازمه ده  چى له سره په خپوودريږي او دا بى دمسيح  عليه السلام   د واسطى  نه نه رامنځ ته كيږي.

Although Christianity has always had a significant diversity of belief, most Christian branches and denominations share a common set of doctrines that they hold as essential to their faith.

===عيسی مسيح===
{{main| Jesus}}
As indicated by the name "Christianity", the focus of Christian theology is a belief in [[Jesus]] as the ''[[Messiah]]'' or ''[[Christ]]''. The title "Messiah" comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word מָשִׁיחַ (''māšiáħ'') meaning "''the anointed one''" or "''King''." The Greek translation {{polytonic|''Χριστός''}} (''Christos'') is the source of the English word [[Christ (title)|''Christ'']].

Christians believe that, as the Messiah, Jesus was anointed as ruler and savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus's coming was the fulfilment of [[Messianic prophecies of Jesus|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from [[Jewish Messiah|the contemporary Jewish concept]].<ref>Jewfaq.org, [http://www.jewfaq.org/moshiach.htm ''The Messiah'']</ref> The core Christian belief is that, through [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], the perfect Son of God, mankind is reconciled to God and thereby attains salvation by grace and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]] to all who trust in Christ. The need for salvation was caused by [[original sin]].

While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, most Christians believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, [[Incarnation (Christianity)|having become fully human]] in all respects, including the aspect of [[death|mortality]], suffered the pains and temptations of mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]], "God raised him from the dead",<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|2:24|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|10:9|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|15:15|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|2:31-32}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|3:15}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|3:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|4:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|5:30}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|10:40-41}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:30}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:34}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:37}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|17:30-31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleverse|2|Cor|4:14}}, {{bibleverse||Gal|1:1}}, {{bibleverse||Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleverse||Col|2:12}}, {{bibleverse|1|Thess|1:10}}, {{bibleverse||Heb|13:20}}, {{bibleverse|1|Pet|1:3}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Pet|1:21}}</ref> he [[Ascension|ascended to heaven]], to the "right hand of God",<ref>{{bibleverse||Mark|16:19}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|22:69}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|2:33}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|5:31}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|7:55-56}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|8:34}}, {{bibleverse||Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleverse||Col|3:1}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|1:3}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|1:13}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|10:12}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|12:2}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:22}}</ref> and will [[Second Coming|return again]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|1:9-11}}</ref> to fulfil the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[Resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]] and establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]] (See also [[Messianism]] and [[Messianic Age]]).

According to the [[Gospel]]s, Jesus was conceived by the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] from the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the virgin Mary]]. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the Gospels compared to his adulthood, especially the week before his death. The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles]], [[Ministry of Jesus|teachings and deeds]].

{{main|Death and Resurrection of Jesus}}

[[Image:Cristo Velázquez lou2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Crucifixion by Diego Velázquez (17th Century)]]
Most Christians consider the death of Jesus, followed by his resurrection, the cornerstone of their faith<ref>{{niv|1_Corinthians|15:13-17|1 Corinthians 15:13-17}}</ref> and the most important event in history.<ref>Gospelcom.net, [http://dailywisdom.gospelcom.net/dw_static/dw-level2.html ''The Most Important Event in History'']; World-faiths.com, [http://www.world-faiths.com/Christianity/christianity.htm ''Christianity'']; [[Hank Hanegraaff]], ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''</ref>

According to the Gospels, Jesus and his followers went to Jerusalem the week of the [[Passover]] where they were [[triumphal entry|eagerly greeted]] by a crowd. In Jerusalem, Jesus [[Jesus and the Money Changers|cleansed the Temple]],<ref>According to the Synoptic Gospels ({{niv|Matthew|21:12-13|Matthew 21:12-13}} and parallel passages), this occurred in the last week of Jesus' life, but {{niv|John|2:13-17|John 2:13-17}} narrates a similar event early in his account of Jesus' ministry.</ref> and predicted its destruction<ref>{{niv|Matthew|24:1-2|Matthew 24:1-2}}, {{niv|Mark|13:2|Mark 13:2}}, {{niv|Luke|21:5-6|Luke 21:5-6}}</ref> - heightening conflict with the Jewish authorities who were plotting his death.<ref>{{niv|Mark|14:1|Mark 14:1}}</ref>

After sharing his [[Last Supper|last meal]] with his disciples, Jesus went to pray in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] where he was betrayed by his disciple [[Judas Iscariot]] and [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]] by the temple guard on orders from the [[Sanhedrin]] and the high priest [[Caiaphas]]. Jesus was [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|convicted by the Sanhedrin]] of blasphemy and transferred to the [[Roman governor]] [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]], who had him crucified for inciting rebellion. Jesus died by late afternoon and was entombed.

Christians believe that God raised Jesus from the dead on the third day, that Jesus appeared to his apostles and other disciples, [[Great Commission|commissioned]] his disciples to "make disciples of all nations, baptizing them [[In the Name of the Father|in the name of the Father]] and of the Son (Jesus) and of the Holy Spirit."<ref>{{niv|Matthew|28:19|Matthew 28:19}}</ref> and [[Ascension|ascended]] to [[heaven]]. Christians also believe that God sent the disciples the Holy Spirit (or [[Paraclete]]).<ref>{{niv|John|20:21-22|John 20:21-22}}, {{niv|Acts|2:1-4|Acts 2:1-4}}</ref>

===Salvation===
{{main|Salvation}}

Christians believe [[salvation]] is a gift by [[Divine grace|unmerited grace of God]], who sent Jesus as the savior. Christians believe that through faith in Jesus one can be saved from [[sin]] and spiritual [[death]]. The crucifixion of Jesus is explained as an [[Atonement|atoning]] [[Sacrifice#Sacrifice in Christianity|sacrifice]], which, in the words of the [[Gospel of John]], "takes away the sins of the world". Reception of salvation is related to [[justification (theology)|justification]].<ref>{{niv|Romans|6:23|Romans 6:23}}, {{niv|Ephesians|2:8-9|Ephesians 2:8-9}}</ref>

The operation and effects of grace are understood differently by different traditions. [[Catholicism]] and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the necessity of the [[free will]] to cooperate with grace.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm Grace and Justification]</ref> [[Reformed theology]] places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that mankind is completely [[total depravity|incapable of self-redemption]], but the grace of God overcomes [[Irresistible grace|even the unwilling heart]].<ref>Westminster Confession, [http://www.pcanet.org/general/cof_chapvi-x.htm#chapx Chapter X];

===د درېګونوالي اند===

تردى ځايه  خبره واضحه  اوښكاره ده ، خو دالوهيت د عقيدي د تفصيل  په اړوند دغه دين د يو ستر بحران سره مخ  ده اوپوهه  پري  څه اسانه خبره نده، تردي چي يوعادى كس هم دى پوهيږي  چى  په مسيحى دين كي د (الله )څښتنت صور  د دريو اقانيمو (Persons )  نه عبارت  دى:
'''۱- پلار .
۲- زوى .
روح القدس.'''
او همدى  ته د تثليت  ( درى ګوني)  عقيده يا (Trinitarian Doctrine)  ويل كيږي.
خود تثليت د عقيدى  په تشريح او تفصيل  كى خپله مسيحى  علماء  د يو له بل نه په جدا لارو روان دى چى يو نه هم په يقين سره مناسب  اوسم تعبيرنه راوځي.
دوى له   نظرد دغه درى   اقانيموله  مجموعي څخه  يوڅښتن راځي . آودغه اقانيم  كوم دى؟
ځيني وائى  : څښتن عبارت  دى  د پلار، زوى  او د مقدس روح  مجموعى څخه . 
(۱) H. Maurice Reition: studies in Christian doctrine , Macmillan , London 1906, p.3 .
(۲) دغه عقيده ديوي لوى مسيحى مذهب عقيده دى، پدى اړه برطانوى  دائرة المعارف  وګوري .ج۲۲، ص ۴۸۹د ( Trinity ) مقاله . 

ځيني بيا وائى:  دڅښتن مجموعه  عبارت ده له :  پلار، زوى او پاك لمنى مريم څخه (1)
اوس ځانته د هر اقنوم څه حيثيت دى ، بيا د هر يو انداز او نسبت د څښتن د مجموعى څخه  چى ( ثالوث) يا (Trinity )  بلل  كيږي  څه دى؟
دغو ټولو پښتونو  ته ځواب ويل د يو پيچلى اولا نجمن  اختلاف  سلسله ده :
څوك نظر لرى چى هر يو په خپل ذات  كى يو الله  ( څښتن ) دى  او مجموعه  ددي څښتنانو  ( ثالوث)  بلل  كيږي (2).
يو بله طائفه ( ډله) بيا وايي چى  هر يو په خپل ذات ( ځان)  كى د يواله  ( څښتن) ده خو په هغه اندازه نه كوم  چى دڅښتنانو مجموعه ( ثالوث)  بلل كيږي ، بلكي  ترهغى كم دى . او د ( الله) څښتن اطلاق  پر دوي  دپراختيا له امله ايښودل شوى (3)
دريمه ډله بيا وائى  :  دغه درى اقانيمه څښتن نشو بللى  اوڅښتن د دريو واړو له مجموعى  ( ثالوث)  څخه  عبارت  دى( 4)

'''
== په تثليت كى  د توحيد عقيده =='''
دغو بى شميرو بيلا بيلو نظرويو  د تثليت  ( درى ګوني)  عقيدى  نه يو بوږنونكي خوب  ګرځولي  ، چي دلته به ددغى عقيدى تفسير وړاندي شي، خو هغه  څه چى ډيرو مسيحيانو ځانونوته غوره كړي او ښايي  ښه مقبوليت دوى ته ولرى ، هغه څه دي چي برطانوى دايرة المعارف كى راځي.
د درى ګوني ( تثليت) مسيحى عقيدى ښه تعبيرپه لاندى ټكوسره كولى شو.
پلار( آب) اله ده، زوى ( ابن) اله ده او مقدس روح هم اله ده خو دغه درى واړه بيا په مجموع كى درى اله ( دري څښتنه )  نه دى او صرف يو اله ده.
دغه مسيحى  عقيده مونږ مجبور وى چى هر يو له دغو دريو ( اقانيمو) څخه څښتن ( اله)  او خپل لوى بادار وبلو، خو كاتوليك مذهب بيا داسى نه ده، هغوى له  دى  منع راوړي چى  هر يو ځان ته څښتن او  بادار و بلل شي.
دريمى مسيحى پيړي ستر عالم او فلسفى ( سينټ اګسټاين )  (St. Augstine) په خپل مشهور كتاب (On the Trinity) كى دغه قضه په پوره تفصيل سره راوړي: 
دعهد قديم ( دپخواني  زمانى) او عهد جيد ( اوسنى زمانى ) دكاتوليك څومره علماوو ليكنى  چى ماته ئى لوستل  اسانه  شوى اوپدى اړوند يى ليكنى كړي  ټول پدى خبره اتفاق سره لرى سره  له هغو ټولو ليكنو سره چى له مانه مخكى ئى په تثليت (درى ګوني) عقيدى كى ليكنى كړي.
(۱ ) د دغى عقيدى خاوندان په عربى مسيحيا نو كى د ( انير مدتيس) مذهب ده، دغه فرقه اوس له منځه تللى، پدى اړه ( نويد جاويد) وګوره  ص 365، د ( Sale ) قس( پشپ) په حواله .

دريم جلد ، 408 ص. لبنان 1909 ته مراجعه وكړى.
(  ۴)St. Thomas Aquinas, Basicwritings of p. 227. v.22.

ټول غواړي چى  د پاكو سپارو  په رڼا  كى دغه قضيه راوڅيړى.
( د پلار، زوى¸او مقدس روح) عقيده چى  په مجموع كى يو ( الهى وحدت) جوړښت ترى منځ راځي په خپل ځان كى تقسيم  او ويشه نه منى  ، دوى درى الهه يا څښتنه نه دى بلكي ټول د يو څښتن څخه عبارت دى ،او له كومى نه چى پلار زوى  پيدا كړي نو پلار زوى نده ،اوله كومى  نه چى زوى له پلاره  زييږدلي نو زوى پلار نده.او مقدس روح نه  پلار ده اونه زوى  . بلكى  دا د پلار  او زوى  روح ده چى  دواړو كى  يو ځاي موندل كيږي او دوى سره په ( ثالوثى) درى ګوني  جوړښت كى يوځاي كيږي .
دا ګمان  دى هم نه كيږي چى دغه ثالوثي جوړښت د پاك  لمنى مريم له ګيډي زيږدلي، او بيا دى د پنطليس پيلاطس په راريا  سولى ځړوولى  وى اوپه دريمه ورځ دى له خپله قبره  بيرته پورته شوى وىاوبيا دي جنت ته ننوځي ځكه  دغه پيښي ثالوثى جوړښت  سره  ندى پيښي شوى او يوازى  او يوازى  د زوى سره پيښي  شوى.
او همداسي   داګمان دى هم نه كيږي چى دغه درى ګوني يو والى چى په يسوع مسيح لكه د هغه  كونترى په شان  چى په ( تعمده) كى راغلى نازل شوى ځكه دغه پيښه د مقدس  روح سره پيښ شوى.
او همداراز داګمان هم نه ده صحيح چى په مسيح مسيح باندى( اعتماد)  تر سره شى او بيا هغه خپلو دريو زده كونكو سره په غزه كى ولاړ وه او دريم جوړښت ورته د ( ته زما زوى ئى)  اواز وكړه.
...... دغه د پلار ويوكى( كلمه) وه چى خپل زوى ئى  پرى راوبله. او دپلار، زوى او مقدس روح سره ويشه سره نه منى، او  دوى سره د ويش نه منونكى پيښي غوندى كار  ترسره شوى، دغه زما عقيده ده ځكه دا يو كاتوليكى عقيده ده (2).
نو اوس عيسايانو سره د درى ګونو يو والى نه د خلاصون لياره كومه  ده چى درى  نه يوجوړوي او پخوا لدى چى ددى سوال په ځواب پوه شو، لا زمه ده چى پلار، زوى او مقدس روح بايد وپيژندل شي؟
'''پلار:'''
په عيسوى عقيده كى  دپلار نه مطلب هغه يو الهى ذات دى چى  د كلام ( خبرو) او د (حيات) ژوندون له صفتووتلى وى، او دا د زوى د پيدايښت  له (  Principal ) اساس اوتهداب ‘ګڼل كيږي ، د پلار دكلمى هغه تفسير چى مشهور مسيحى  فيلسوف (توماس اكو نياس) (St.Thomas Aquinas)كړي سم ندى كوم چى وائى :
پلار يو څوك  زيږولى، او يوڅه وخت تير شوى وه چى پلار وه او زوى وجود نه درلود، او دا يو لاهوتى ( خدائى) اصطلاح  ده چى يو ازى دا معنى لرى چى پلار دى د زوى اساس وى لكه چى ذات  دڅښتن دصفاتوپيليزه او اساس  ده . او كه نه له كومى نه چى پلار ده زوى هم وه.
د متي هغي قصي ته اشاره ده 17 : 5 د تجلى قصه.
Basic writing of St. Augstine, Trans by: A.W. Haddan & edited by Whitney, Newyork 1948, p.672.v.2.

او يوهم  پربل د پيدايښت مخكى نه لرى. (1).
اوس نو ولى الهى ذات ( پلار) بلل كيږي؟  و دى پوښتني په ځواب كى ( الفريد اى ګاروي) 
ليكى:
لاندى خبرى نه مطلب  ځينو حقايقو ته د انسان نظر اړول دى،او لومړي اشاره دى ته ده چى  ټول مخلوقات په خپل  پيدايښت  كى څښتن ته ضرورت لرى، لكه چى  زوى پلار ته ضرورت لرى.
دوهم : دى كى دا دلالت پروت دى چى الله په خپلو بندګانو  داسى مهربانه وه لكه چى  پلار په خپلو زامنو(2)
زوى
زوى نه د عيسوى مذهب مراد دخداى د خبرو صفت ده (  Word of God) كومى خبرى چى د انسانانو د خبرو په رنګي نه وى ، د خداى او د بنده د خبرو تر منځ يو لوى توپير پروت دى كوم چى " اكويناس" ئى بيا نوى:
په انسانى فطرت د خبرو صفت كي  كوم جوهرى ( اصل)  وجود نه لرى او همدا وجه ده چى دى ته  مونږ د انسان زوى يا د انسان  ماشوم نه شو ويلى خو د خداى دخبرو صفت يو جوهرى صفت دى چى په اصل كى ځان  ته وجود لرى، نوځكه په مجازي توګه  (زوى) بلل كيږي  اوهر څه چى پليزه او اساس ده هغه ( پلار)  ده .(3)
د عيسوى عقيدى په مطابق د خداى نه چى كومه اندازه معلومات لاس ته راځي ټول دهمدغه صفت په ذريعه سرته رسيږي او د همدغه صفت نه ټول څيزونه پيداكيږي او دغه صفت د
( پلار) په شانى پخوانى اوهميشه دى (۴) او همدغه الهى صفت وه چى  په انسانى وجود كى ئى حلول وكړ او د مسيح بن مريم په شكل څرګند شو او له همدى نه د ( خداى زوى بلل كيږي).

{{main|Trinity}}
[[Image:Andrej Rublëv 001.jpg|left|thumb|215px|The [[Hospitality of Abraham]] by Andrei Rublev: The three angels represent the three persons of God]]

Most Christians believe that God is spirit (''{{bibleverse||John|4:24}}''), an uncreated, [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and eternal being, the creator and sustainer of all things, who works the redemption of the world through his Son, Jesus Christ. 

Against this background, belief in the [[Christology|divinity of Christ]] and the Holy Spirit was expressed as the doctrine of the [[Holy Trinity]],<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'' pp. 87-90; T. Desmond Alexander, ''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'' pp. 514-515; Alister E. McGrath, ''Historical Theology'' p. 61.</ref>, which describes the single Divine [[Ousia|''substance'']] existing as three distinct and inseparable ''persons'': the [[God the Father|Father]], the Son ([[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] the [[Jesus Christ the Logos|eternal Word]]), and the [[Holy Spirit]]. According to the doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (''see [[Perichoresis]]''). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten, the Son begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeding.<ref>Vladimir Lossky [http://home.versatel.nl/chotki/God%20in%20Trin.htm ''God in Trinity'']; [[Loraine Boettner]], [http://www.caledonianfire.org/caledonianfire/Boettner/trinity/t5.htm ''One Substance, Three Persons'']</ref> "Begotten", in these formulae, does not refer to Mary's conceiving Jesus, but to the Son's relationship to the Father, which is described as being "eternally begotten" of the Father.

Trinitarian Christian also conceive of salvation as one work of the triune God, in which "the three divine persons act together as one, and manifest their own proper characteristics."<ref>For an example from Reformed theology see: John Hendryx, [http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/onsite/monergism_short.html ''The Work of the Trinity in Monergism'']; for the Catholic view see: [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#50 Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraph 50)] part 1, section 2, Chapter Two.</ref>

Trinitarian Christians trace the orthodox formula of the Trinity — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — back to the resurrected Jesus himself, who used this phrase in the [[Great Commission]] ({{bverse|Matthew|28:16-20}}).

Most Christians believe the Holy Spirit inspired the Scriptures,<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#II '' Sacred Scripture'']; ''Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy'', [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/chicago.htm ''online text'']; {{niv|2_Timothy|3:16|2 Timothy 3:16}}; {{niv|2_Peter|1:21|2 Peter 1:21}}</ref> and that his active participation in a believer's life (even to the extent of "indwelling" within the believer), joining the believer's free actions with his own, is essential to living a Christian life.<ref>{{niv|John|16:7-14|John 16:7-14}}; {{niv|1_Corinthians|2:10|1 Corinthians 2:10ff}}</ref> In Catholic, Orthodox, and some Anglican theology, this indwelling is received through the sacrament called [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]] or, in the East, [[Chrismation]]. Most Protestant traditions teach that the gift of the Holy Spirit is symbolized by baptism; however some (Baptists and comparable groups) do not attribute any sacramental significance to baptism.  Pentecostal and Charismatic Protestants believe the [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]] is a distinct experience separate from other experiences like conversion or water baptism, and many Pentecostals believe it will always&mdash;or at least usually&mdash;be evident through [[glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues).

{{main|Nontrinitarianism}}

In antiquity, and again following the Reformation, several sects advocated views contrary to the Trinity. These views were rejected by many bishops such as [[Irenaeus]] and subsequently by the [[Ecumenical Council]]s. During the Reformation, though most Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants accepted the value of many of the Councils, some groups rejected these councils as spiritually tainted.<ref>MacCulloch, ''Reformation'' pp. 185, 187</ref> [[Clement Ziegler]], [[Casper Schwenckfeld]], and [[Melchior Hoffman]] advanced the view that Christ was only divine and not human. [[Michael Servetus]] denied the divinity of Christ, as did others who were tried at Augsburg in 1527.<ref>MacCulloch, ''Reformation'' pp. 186-8</ref>

Modalists, such as [[Oneness Pentecostal]]s, regard God as a single person, with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit considered modes or roles by which the unipersonal God expresses himself.<ref>William Arnold, [http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/father.htm ''Is Jesus God the Father?'']; in this way they parallel ancient [[Sabellianism|Sabellians]], see: J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'' pp. 119-123; Robert Letham, ''The Holy Trinity: In Scripture, History, Theology, and Worship'' pp. 97-98</ref>

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] accept the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but deny that they are the same being, believing them to be separate beings united only in will and purpose.<ref>{{cite web | last =Hinckley | first = Gordon |title=First Presidency Message: The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost | work =Ensign | date = March, 1998|url=http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1998.htm/ensign%20march%201998.htm/first%20presidency%20message%20the%20father%20son%20and%20holy%20ghost.htm?fn=document-frame.htm&f=templates&2.0| accessmonthday =September 8 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> (see [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]])

{{main|Bible}}

Christianity regards the [[Bible]], a collection of [[Biblical canon|canonical]] books in two parts, the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], as authoritative: written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and therefore [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]].<ref> [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#II ''Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture'' (§105-108)]; Second Helvetic Confession, [http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm, ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']; [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']</ref> Protestants believe that the scriptures contain all [[Revelation|revealed truth]] necessary for salvation  (See [[Sola scriptura]]).<ref> Thirty-nine Articles, [http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.htm Art. VI]; [[Westminster Catechism]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/larger1.html Q. 3]; [[James White]], [http://www.aomin.org/SolaTop.html ''Does The Bible Teach Sola Scriptura?'']</ref>

The Old Testament contains the entire Jewish [[Tanakh]], though in the Christian canon the books are ordered differently and some books of the Tanakh are divided into several books by the Christian canon. The Catholic and Orthodox canons include the Hebrew Jewish canon and other books (from the Septuagint Greek Jewish canon) which Catholics call [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical]], while Protestants consider them [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].<ref name="Canon">F.F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture''; Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#IV, ''The Canon of Scripture'' § 120]; Thirty-nine Articles, [http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html Art. VI]</ref>

The first four books of the New Testament are the [[Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]]), which recount the life and teachings of Jesus. The first three are often called [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]] because of the amount of material they share. The rest of the New Testament consists of a sequel to Luke's Gospel, the [[Acts of the Apostles]], which describes the very early history of the Church, a collection of letters from early Christian leaders to congregations or individuals, the [[Pauline epistles|Pauline]] and [[General epistles]], and the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] [[Book of Revelation]].<ref name="Canon"> </ref>

Some traditions maintain other [[Religious text|canons]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] maintains two canons, the Narrow Canon, itself larger than any Biblical canon outside Ethiopia, and the Broad Canon, which has even more books.<ref>Ethiopian Orthodox Old Testament, [http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/ethold.stm ''The Bible: The Book That Bridges the Millennia'']
</ref>The [[Latter-day Saints]] hold the Bible and three additional books to be the inspired word of God: the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]].<ref>The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [http://scriptures.lds.org ''The Scriptures, Internet Edition'']</ref> 

====ژباړه====
Though Christians largely agree on the content of the Bible, there is significant divergence in its interpretation, or [[exegesis]]. In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in [[Alexandria]] and [[School of Antioch|Antioch]]. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by [[Origen]], tended to read Scripture allegorically, while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''theoria'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'' pp. 69-78.</ref>

Catholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual, the latter being subdivided into the allegorical, moral, and [[Anagoge|anagogical]] senses. The literal sense is "the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation." The allegorical sense includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]], for example the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] is seen as a "type" of or sign of baptism;<ref>{{niv|1_Corinthians|10:2|1 Corinthians 10:2}}</ref> the moral sense contains ethical teaching; the anagogical sense includes eschatology and applies to eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]].<ref> Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115-118]</ref> Catholic theology also adds other rules of interpretation, which include the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the literal,<ref>Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm ''Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?'']; c.f. Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116]</ref> that the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held,<ref>Second [[Vatican Council]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)]</ref> that scripture must be read within the "living Tradition of the whole Church",<ref> Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 113]</ref> and that "the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the [[Bishop of Rome]]."<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III ''The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith'' § 85]</ref>

Many Protestants stress the literal sense or [[historical-grammatical method]],<ref>R.C. Sproul, ''Knowing Scripture'' pp. 45-61; [[Greg Bahnsen]], [http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm ''A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (art. 6)]</ref> even to the extent of rejecting other senses altogether. Martin Luther advocated "one definite and simple understanding of Scripture".<ref name="Foutz">Scott Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml '' Martin Luther and Scripture'']</ref> Other Protestant interpreters make use of typology.<ref>E.g., in his [http://eword.gospelcom.net/comments/matthew/mh/matthew1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.3) [[Matthew Henry]] interprets the twin-sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and [[Jewish Christians]]. For a contemporary treatment, see W. Edward Glenny, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html ''Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion'']</ref> Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear (or "perspicuous"), because of the help of the Holy Spirit, or both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be "enveloped in darkness",<ref name="Foutz"> </ref> but [[John Calvin]] wrote, "all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light."<ref>John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol45/htm/vii.iv.iv.htm '' Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles'' 2 Peter 3:14-18]</ref> The [[Helvetic Confessions|Second Helvetic Confession]] said, "we hold that interpretation of the Scripture to be orthodox and genuine which is gleaned from the Scriptures themselves (from the nature of the language in which they were written, likewise according to the circumstances in which they were set down, and expounded in the light of like and unlike passages and of many and clearer passages)." The writings of the Church Fathers, and decisions of Ecumenical Councils, though "not despise<nowiki>[d]</nowiki>", were not authoritative and could be rejected.<ref> Second Helvetic Confession, [http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c02.htm ''Of Interpreting the Holy Scriptures; and of Fathers, Councils, and Traditions'']</ref>

===Creeds===
{{main|Creeds}}
Creeds, or concise doctrinal statements, began as baptismal formulas and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the [[4th century|fourth]] and [[5th century|fifth centuries]]. The earliest creeds still in common use are the [[Apostles' Creed]] ([[Apostles' Creed#Latin text|text]] in Latin and Greek, with English translations) and Paul's creed of {{bibleverse|1|Cor|15:1-9}}.

{{wikisource|Nicene Creed}}
The [[Nicene Creed]], largely a response to [[Arianism]], was formulated at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively,<ref> Catholics United for the Faith, [http://www.cuf.org/faithfacts/details_view.asp?ffID=191 ''We Believe in One God'']; Encyclopedia of Religion, ''Arianism''</ref> and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in [[431]].<ref name=ephesus> Catholic Encyclopedia (vol. 5), [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm ''Council of Ephesus'']</ref>

The [[Chalcedonian Creed]], developed at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451,<ref> [[Matt Slick]], [http://www.carm.org/creeds/chalcedonian.htm ''Chalcedonian Creed'']; [[History of Christianity|Christian History]] Institute, [http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2003/10/daily-10-08-2003.shtml ''First Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon'']</ref>
(though not accepted by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches)<ref> [[British Orthodox Church]], [http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php The Oriental Orthodox Rejection of Chalcedon]</ref> taught Christ "to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably": one divine and one human, that both natures are perfect but are nevertheless [[Hypostatic union|perfectly united into one person]].<ref>Pope Leo I, [http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/4ecumen2.htm Letter to Flavian]</ref>

The [[Athanasian Creed]] ([[Athanasian Creed#English-Language Translations|English translations]]), received in the western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons not dividing the Substance."<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia (vol. 2) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm ''Athanasian Creed'']</ref>

Most Protestants accept the Creeds. Some Protestant traditions believe Trinitarian doctrine without making use of the Creeds themselves,<ref>E.g., The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] gives no official status to any of the ancient creeds, but the [[Baptist Faith and Message]] says:
:The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#ii]</ref> while other Protestants, like the [[Restoration Movement]], oppose the use of creeds.<ref>http://www.appiusforum.com/restoration.html "The History of the Church", Howard A. White</ref>

===Eschaton and afterlife===
{{main|Christian eschatology}}

Most Christians believe that upon the death of the body, the individual [[soul]], which is considered to be immortal, experiences the [[particular judgment]] and is either rewarded with [[heaven]] or condemned to [[hell]]. The elect are called "saints" (Latin ''sanctus'': "holy") and the process of being made holy is called sanctification. In Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace but with either unforgiven venial sins or incomplete [[penance]] undergo purification in [[purgatory]] to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into heaven.

At the [[Second Coming|last coming of Christ]], the ''eschaton'' or [[end of time]], all who have died will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected bodily from the dead]] for the [[Last Judgement]], whereupon Jesus will fully establish the [[Kingdom of God]] in fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|scriptural prophecies]].<ref name="res"> See, e.g., [[Thomas Aquinas]], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm ''Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis''] questions 69 through 99; and John Calvin, [http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book3/bk3ch25.html ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', Book Three, Ch. 25].</ref>

Some groups do not distinguish a particular judgment from the [[general judgment]] at the end of time, teaching instead that souls remain in stasis until this time (see [[Soul sleep]]).  These groups, and others that do not believe in the [[intercession]] of saints, generally do not employ the word "saint" to describe those in heaven. [[Universal reconciliation|Universalists]] hold that eventually all will experience salvation, thereby rejecting the concept of an eternal hell for those who are not saved.

==Worship and practices==
===Christian life===
[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Christians]] believe that [[Jesus]] is the mediator of the [[New Covenant]] (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=65&chapter=8&version=47 Hebrews 8:6])(and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1tim2:5&version=31 1Timothy2:5]). His famous [[Sermon on the Mount]] representing [[Mount Zion]] is considered by many Christian scholars to be the [[Typology (theology)|antitype]]<ref>See also [[Expounding of the Law#Antithesis of the Law|Antithesis of the Law]].</ref> of the proclamation of the [[Ten Commandments|Old Covenant]] by [[Moses]] from [[Mount Sinai]]]]

Christians believe that all people should strive to follow Christ in their everyday actions. For many, this includes obedience to the [[Ten Commandments]]<ref>For details, see [[Old Testament#Christian view of the Law]].<ref/>. For other individuals, they see [[The Old Law|the old law]] has been "done away with" and replaced with the New covenant. Jesus taught that the [[Ministry of Jesus#General Ethics|greatest commandments]] were to: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength", and to "love your neighbor as yourself".</ref> <ref>{{niv|matthew|22:37-40|Matthew 22:37-40}}</ref> This love includes such injunctions as "feed the hungry" and "shelter the homeless", and applies to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|friend and enemy alike]]. Though the relationship between charity and religious practice are sometimes taken for granted today, as [[Martin Goodman (historian)|Martin Goodman]] has observed, "charity in the Jewish and Christian sense was unknown to the pagan world."<ref>Martin Goodman, ''The Ruling Class of Judaea: The Origins of the Jewish Revolt Against Rome AD 66-70'', [[Cambridge University Press]], p.65 </ref>  Other Christian practices include acts of [[piety]] such as [[prayer]] and Bible reading.

Christianity teaches that one can only overcome sin through divine grace: moral and spiritual progress can only occur with God's help through the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]] dwelling within the believer. Christians believe that by sharing in Christ's life, death, and resurrection, and by believing in Christ, they become dead to sin and are resurrected to a new life with Him.

===Liturgical worship===
[[Justin Martyr]] described second century Christian [[liturgy]] in his ''First [[Apologetics|Apology]]'' (''c''. 150) to [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], and his description remains relevant to the [[basic structure]] of Christian liturgical worship:
[[Image:Thebible33.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The Holy Bible, [[Crucifix]], and [[Rosary]]]]
:"And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need."<ref>Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII</ref>

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the Gospels. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession, and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed. The Eucharist (also called [[Holy Communion]], or the [[Lord's Supper]]) consists of a ritual meal of consecrated bread and wine, discussed in detail below. Lastly, a collection occurs in which the congregation donates money for the support of the Church and for [[Charitable organization|charitable work]].

Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between "[[High church|High]]" [[church service]]s, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and "[[Low church|Low]]" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. [[Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday (the original [[Sabbath]]), while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak. Some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing, and use of multimedia.  For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally lead by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (e.g. many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or [[wedding]]s in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]] Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or Sabbath school (Sunday schools are sometimes held before rather than during services).

====Sacraments====
{{main|Sacrament}}
{{seealso| Sacraments of the Catholic Church}}
[[Image:Fractio-panis1.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The [[Eucharist]]]]

A [[sacrament]] is a Christian rite that is an outward sign of an inward grace, instituted by Christ to sanctify humanity. Catholic, Orthodox, and some [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Christians describe [[Christian worship]] in terms of seven sacraments: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]] or [[Chrismation]], [[Eucharist]] (communion), [[Penance]] (reconciliation), [[Anointing of the Sick]] (last rites), [[Holy Orders]] (ordination), and [[Catholic marriage|Matrimony]].<ref>For Catholicism: see ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §1210</ref> Many Protestant groups, following [[Martin Luther]],<ref>Martin Luther, ''Small Catechism''</ref> recognize the sacramental nature of baptism and Eucharist, but not usually the other five in the same way, while other Protestant groups reject sacramental theology. Latter-day saint worship emphasizes the symbolic role of rites, calling some ''[[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]]''. Though not sacraments, [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]], and [[Holiness Churches]] emphasize "[[gifts of the Spirit]]" such as [[spiritual healing]], [[prophecy]], [[exorcism]], [[glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues), and [[laying on of hands]] where God's grace is mysteriously manifest.

====Eucharist====
{{main|Eucharist}}
The [[Eucharist]] (also called [[Holy Communion]], or the [[Lord's Supper]]) is the part of liturgical worship that consists of a consecrated meal, usually bread and wine. Justin Martyr described the Eucharist as follows:
:"And this food is called among us Eukaristia [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh."<ref>Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII</ref>

Orthodox, Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and many Anglicans believe that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ (the doctrine of the [[Real Presence]]). Most other Protestants, especially Reformed, believe the bread and wine ''represent'' the body and blood of Christ. These Protestants may celebrate it less frequently, while in Catholicism the Eucharist is celebrated daily. Catholic and Orthodox view communion as indicating those who are already united in the church, restricting participation to their members not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. In some Protestant churches participation is by prior arrangement with a church leader. Other churches view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all Christians or even anyone to participate.

====Liturgical Calendar====
{{main|Liturgical year}}
In the New Testament [[Paul of Tarsus]] organised his missionary travels around the celebration of [[Pentecost]]. (Acts 20.16 and 1 Corinthians 16.8) This practice draws from Jewish tradition, with such feasts as the [[Feast of Tabernacles]], the [[Passover]], and the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]]. Today Catholics, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around a [[Liturgical year|liturgical calendar]]. This includes [[Holy Day of Obligation|holy days]], such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]. A few churches make no use of a liturgical calendar.

===Symbols===
Today the best-known Christian symbol is the [[Christian cross|cross]], which refers to the method of Jesus' execution.<ref>Catholic-reources.org, [http://catholic-resources.org/Art/Koch-ChristianSymbols.htm ''Christian Symbols'']</ref> Several varieties exist, with some denominations tending to favor distinctive styles: Catholics the [[crucifix]], Orthodox the [[crux orthodoxa]], and Protestants an unadorned cross. An earlier Christian symbol was the '[[ichthys]]' fish (Greek Alpha - α) symbol and anagram.  Other text based symbols include '[[Christogram|IHS or ICXC]]' and '[[Labarum|chi-rho]]' (the first two letters of the word Christ in Greek). In a modern [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], the Chi-Rho appears like an ''X'' (Chi - χ) with a large ''P'' (Rho - ρ) overlaid and above it. It is said [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine]] saw this symbol prior to converting to Christianity (see History and origins section below). Another ancient symbol is an [[anchor]], which denotes faith and can incorporate a cross within its design.

==History and origins==
{{main|History of Christianity}}
{{seealso|Timeline of Christianity|Early Christianity}}
{{Seealso|Christian philosophy|Christian art|Christian literature|Christian music|Christian architecture}}

[[Image:Nicaea icon.jpg|right|thumb|An icon depicting the [[First Council of Nicaea]]]]

In the mid-first century, Christianity spread beyond its Jewish origins under the leadership of the Apostles, especially [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. Within a generation an episcopal hierarchy can be seen, and this would form the structure of the Church.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm ''Canons of the Council of Nicaea''], especially canon 6.</ref>Christianity spread east to Asia and throughout the Roman Empire, despite [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] by the Roman Emperors until its [[Edict of Milan|legalization]] by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Emperor Constantine]] in 313. During his reign, questions of orthodoxy lead to the convocation of the first Ecumenical Council, that of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]].

In 391 [[Theodosius I]] established [[Nicene]] Christianity as the official and, except for [[Judaism]], only legal religion in the [[Roman Empire]]. Later, as the [[political structure]] of the empire collapsed in the West, the Church assumed political and cultural roles previously held by the Roman aristocracy. Eremitic and Coenobitic [[monasticism]] developed, originating with the hermit [[Anthony the Great|St Anthony of Egypt]] around 300.  With the avowed purpose of fleeing the world and its evils ''in contemptu mundi'', the institution of monasticism would become a central part of the medieval world.<ref>Jo Ann H. Moran Cruze and Richard Gerberding, ''Medieval Worlds'' pp. 118-119</ref>

Christianity became the established church of the Axumite Kingdom (presently encompassing Eritrea and Northern Ethiopi ) under king Ezana in the 4th century through the efforts of a Syrian Greek named Frumentius, known in Ethiopia as Abba Selama, Kesaté Birhan ("Father of Peace, Revealer of Light"), thus making Ethiopia one of the first christian state even before most of Europe. As a youth, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the Eritrean coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the [[royal court]], where they rose to positions of influence and converted Emperor Ezana to Christianity, causing him to be baptised. Ezana sent Frumentius to Alexandria to ask the Patriarch, [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], to appoint a bishop for Ethiopia. Athanasius appointed Frumentius himself, who returned to Ethiopia as Bishop with the name of Abune Selama.

During the [[Migration Period]] of [[Late Antiquity]], various [[Germanic peoples]] adopted Christianity. Meanwhile, as western political unity dissolved, the linguistic divide of the Empire between Latin-speaking West and the Greek-speaking East intensified.  By the [[Middle Ages]] distinct forms of Latin and Greek Christianity increasingly separated until [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] and disciplinary disputes finally resulted in the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] (conventionally dated to 1054), which formally divided [[Christendom]] into the Catholic west and the Orthodox east. [[Western Christianity]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was characterized by cooperation and conflict between the [[Secularism|secular]] rulers and the Church under the [[Pope]], and by the development of [[Scholasticism|scholastic theology and philosophy]].

Beginning in the [[7th century]], [[Muslim]] rulers began a long series of military conquests of Christian areas, and it quickly conquered areas of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Asia Minor]], Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and [[North Africa]], and even captured southern [[Spain]]. Numerous military struggles followed, including the [[Crusades]], the Spanish [[Reconquista]], the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the aggression of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].
[[Image:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der Ältere.jpeg|right|thumb|125px|Martin Luther]]

In the early [[16th century|sixteenth century]], increasing discontent with corruption and immorality among the clergy resulted in attempts to reform the Church and society. The [[Protestant Reformation]] began after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[95 theses]] in 1517, whilst the [[Roman Catholic Church]] experienced internal renewal with the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563). During the following centuries, competition between Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states. Meanwhile, partly from missionary zeal, but also under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, [[East Asia]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

In the Modern Era, Christianity was confronted with various forms of [[skepticism]] and with certain modern [[Ideology|political ideologies]] such as [[liberalism]], [[nationalism]], and [[socialism]]. This included the [[anti-clericalism]] of the French Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, and general hostility of Marxist movements, especially [[Russian Revolution|the Russian Revolution]].

===Persecution===
{{main|Persecution of Christians}}
{{main|Historical persecution by Christians}}

Christians have frequently suffered from [[Religious persecution|persecution]]. Starting with [[Jesus]], the early Christian church was persecuted by state and religious establishments from its earliest beginnings. Notable early Christians such as [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], eleven of the Apostles as well as [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] died as martyrs according to tradition. Systematic Roman persecution of Christians culminated in the [[Diocletian#Persecution of Christians|Great Persecution]] of Diocletian and ended with the [[Edict of Milan]].<ref>ChristianityToday.com [http://ctlibrary.com/3744 ''313 The Edict of Milan'']</ref> Persecution of Christians persisted or even intensified in other places, such as in [[Sassanids|Sassanid Persia]].<ref>Macro History, [http://www.fsmitha.com/h1/ch22c.htm ''The Sassanids to 500 CE'']</ref> Later Christians living in [[Islam]]ic countries were subjected to various legal restrictions, which included taxation and a ban on building or repairing churches. Christians at times also suffered violent persecution or confiscation of their property<ref>(Lewis (1984) p. 26)</ref>

There was persecution of Christians during the [[French Revolution]] (see [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution]]).<ref>Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience'' (vol. 2) chapter 21</ref> State restrictions on Christian practices today are generally associated with those authoritarian governments which either support a majority religion other than Christianity (as in [[Muslim]] states),<ref>Paul Marshall, ''Their Blood Cries Out''; Worldnetdaily.com, [http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=24886 ''Christians persecuted in Islamic nations'']</ref> or tolerate only churches under government supervision, sometimes while officially promoting state [[atheism]] (as in [[North Korea]]). The [[People's Republic of China]] allows only government-regulated churches and has regularly suppressed [[house churches]] and underground Catholics. The public practice of Christianity is outlawed in [[Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]]. Areas of persecution include other parts of the [[Middle East]], the [[Sudan]], and [[Kosovo]].<ref>see [http://www.persecution.org/newsite/index.php persecution.org];[http://www.christianmonitor.org/ christianmonitor.org]; and Cliff Kincaid, [http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/4610_0_2_0_C/ aim.org ''Christians Under Siege in Kosovo'']</ref>

Christians have also been perpetrators of persecution against other religions and other Christians. Christian mobs, sometimes with government support, destroyed [[Paganism|pagan]] temples and oppressed adherents of paganism (such as the philosopher [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], who was murdered by a Christian mob). Also, [[Jewish]] communities have periodically suffered violence at Christian hands. Christian governments have suppressed or persecuted groups seen as heretical, later in cooperation with the [[Inquisition]]. Denominational strife escalated into [[religious wars]]. [[Witch hunts]], carried out by secular authorities or popular mobs, were a frequent phenomenon in parts of [[early modern Europe]] and, to a lesser degree, North America.

==Christian divisions==
There is a diversity of [[doctrine]]s and practices among groups calling themselves Christian. These groups are sometimes classified under [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system.<ref>S. E. Ahlstrom characterized [[denominationalism]] in America as “a virtual ecclesiology” that “first of all repudiates the insistences of the Roman Catholic church, the churches of the 'magisterial' Reformation, and of most sects that they alone are the true Church." Ahlstrom p. 381. For specific citations, on the Roman Catholic Church see the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §816; other examples: Donald Nash, [http://www.crownhillchurch.com/Why_the_Churches_of_Christ_Are_Not_A_Denomination.pdf#search=%22church%20of%20christ%20not%20a%20denomination%22 Why the Churches of Christ are not a Denomination]; Wendell Winkler, [http://www.thebible.net/introchurch/ch4.html Christ's Church is not a Denomination]; and David E. Pratt, [http://www.biblestudylessons.com/cgi-bin/gospel_way/denominations.php What does God think about many Christian denominations?]</ref> Christianity may be broadly represented as being [[Schism (religion)|divided]] into three main groupings:<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9360716 Christianity]</ref>
* [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]: The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the largest single body, includes the [[Latin Rite]] and totals more than 1 billion baptized members.<ref name="Adherents" />
* [[Eastern Christianity]]: [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the 100,000 member [[Assyrian Church of the East]],<ref>Nichols, ''Rome and the Eastern Churches'', pp. 27-52</ref> and others with a combined membership of more than 300 million baptized members.<ref name="Adherents" />
* [[Anglican Communion|Anglicanism]]: The Anglican Communion is a group of Anglican and [[Episcopal Church]]es that are descended from the [[Church of England]].  Most Anglicans don't consider themselves Protestant or Catholic but believe that the Church of England always existed and wasn't formed during the Reformation but rather broke away from the Church of Rome.
* [[Protestantism]]: Groups such as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Reformed]]/[[Presbyterian]]s, [[Congregational church|Congregational]]/[[United Church of Christ]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]], [[Baptist]]s, [[Methodist]]s, [[Nazarene]]s, [[Anabaptist]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]]. The oldest of these separated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], followed in many cases by further divisions. Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, partly because of the difficulty in determining which denominations should be placed in this category, but it seems to be unquestionable that Protestantism is the second major branch of Christianity (after Roman Catholicism) in number of followers.<ref name="Adherents" />

Some Protestants identify themselves simply as ''Christian,'' or ''born-again Christian''; they typically distance themselves from the [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] of other Protestant communities<ref>Confessionalism is a term employed by historians to describe "the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their [[self-understanding]], and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves &mdash; they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed." [[MacCulloch]], ''Reformation'' p. xxiv</ref> by calling themselves "non-denominational" &mdash; often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.  Finally, various small communities, such as the [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] and [[Independent Catholic Churches]], are similar in name to the Roman Catholic Church, but are not in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]] (the [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] church is in communion with the [[Anglican Church]]).The Roman Catholic Church was simply called the "Catholic Church" until other groups started considering themselves "Catholic". The term "Roman Catholic" was made to distinguish the Roman Catholics from other groups.<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03449a.htm "Catholic", Herbert Thurston, ''Dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus'', The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume III. Published 1908. New York: Robert Appleton Company.</ref><ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13121a.htm "Roman Catholic", The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIII. Published 1912. New York: Robert Appleton Company. First published in The Month, Sept 1911.</ref><ref>{{OED|catholic}}</ref> 

[[Restorationism|Restorationists]], are historically connected to the Protestant Reformation,<ref>Ahlstrom's summary is as follows: Restorationism has its genesis with Thomas and [[Alexander Campbell]], whose movement is connected to the German Reformed Church through Otterbein, Albright, and Winebrenner (p. 212). American [[Millennialism]] and [[Adventist|Adventism]], which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, produced certain groups such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (p. 387, 501-9), the Jehovah's Witness movement (p. 807), and, as a reaction specifically to [[William Miller]], Seventh Day Adventism (p. 381).</ref> do not usually describe themselves as "reforming" a [[Christian Church]] continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. Restorationists include [[Churches of Christ]] with 2.6 million members, [[Disciples of Christ]] with 800,000 members,<ref> ''Statistical Report: Annual Council of the General Conference Committee Silver Spring, Marlyand, October 6&mdash;11, 2006''</ref> [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] with 12 million members,<ref name="Adherents" /> and [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]] with 6.6 million members.<ref>JW-Media.org [http://www.jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm#Jehovah%Witness%Membership%2005 Membership 2005]</ref> Though Restorationists have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.

[[Image:ChristianityBranches.svg|600px|thumb|center||A simplified chart of historical developments of major groups within Christianity]]

====Mainstream Christianity====

[[Mainstream]] Christianity is a widely used<ref>Appx 112k [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Mainstream+Christianity%22 GHits]</ref> term, used to refer to collectively to the common views of major denominations of Christianity (such as [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Orthodox Christianity]]) as against the particular tenets of other sects or [[Christian denomination]].  The context is dependent on the particular issues addressed, but usually contrasts the [[orthodox]] majority view against [[heterodox]] minority views. In the most [[common sense]], "mainstream" refers to [[Nicene Christianity]], or rather the traditions which continue to claim adherence to the [[Nicene Creed]].<ref>"[[The Nicene Creed]] is the profession of the Christian Faith common to the Catholic Church, to all the Eastern Churches separated from Rome, and to most of the Protestant denominations." The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XI. Published 1911. New York: Robert Appleton Company.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11049a.htm]</ref><ref>"Christian statement of faith that is the only ecumenical creed because it is accepted as authoritative by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and major Protestant churches." 
''Nicene Creed'' [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9055702]</ref>

Some groups identifying themselves as Christian deviate from the [[tenets]] considered basic by most Christian organizations. These groups are often considered [[Christian heresy|heretical]], or even non-Christian, by many mainstream Christians. This is particularly true of [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarians]].

==== Ecumenism ====
{{main|Ecumenism}}
{{unreferenced|section called "Ecumenism"|date=February 2007}}
Most churches have long expressed ideals of being reconciled with each other, and in the [[20th Century]] Christian [[ecumenism]] advanced in two ways. One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of Protestants in [[1910]], the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] founded in [[1948]] by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] which also includes Roman Catholics.

The other way was institutional union with new [[United and uniting churches]]. [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Methodist]], and [[Presbyterian]] churches united in 1925 to form the [[United Church of Canada]] and in 1977 to form the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. The [[Church of South India]] was formed in 1947 by the union of [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and [[Reformed Church|Reformed]] churches.

Steps towards union on a global level have also been taken in 1965 by the Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054; the [[Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission]] (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970; and the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches signing The [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In 2006 the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist church]] also adopted the declaration.

==Current controversies and criticisms==
<!-- Hello. This section is the product of extensive discussion on [[Talk:Christianity]]. Please consider passing proposed changes through the Talk page before making them here. Thank you.-->
{{main|Criticism of Christianity}}
{{See also|Criticism of the Bible}}

There are many controversies surrounding Christianity as to its influences and history.

*Although historians generally agree that [[historicity of Jesus|Jesus existed]], a few writers propose that [[Jesus as myth|Jesus is a myth]],<ref>Kenneth Latourette, ''Christianity'' p. 394; [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], ''Egyptian Religion''</ref> and have aimed at reconstructing the [[historical Jesus]]. Some such writers depict Jesus as a metaphor for [[Religious experience|spiritual awakening]] or a fictional figure based on [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian religion]].
*Some writers consider [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to be the founding figure of Christianity, pointing to the extent of his writings and the scope of his [[Missionary|missionary work]].<ref>David Wenham, ''Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?''</ref> See also [[Pauline Christianity]].
*Members of the [[Jesus Seminar]], and other Biblical scholars, have argued that the historical Jesus never claimed to be divine. They also reject the historicity of the [[empty tomb]] and thus a bodily resurrection, and several other events narrated in the gospels. They assert that Gospel accounts describing these things are probably literary fabrications.<ref>"The empty tomb is a fiction - Jesus did not raise ''(sic)'' bodily from the dead." front flap of ''Acts of Jesus''.</ref>
*Adherents of [[Judaism]] generally believe that followers of Christianity misinterpret passages from the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]]. (See also [[Judaism and Christianity]].)
*[[Islam|Muslims]] believe that the Christian doctrine of the Trinity is incompatible with [[Tawhid|monotheism]], and they reject the Christian teaching that Jesus is the Son of God, though they affirm the [[Virgin Birth|virgin birth]] and view him as a prophet preceding Muhammad.<ref>Gary Miller, [http://thetruereligion.org/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=122 ''A concise reply to Christianity''].</ref> The Qur'an also uses the title "Messiah", though with a different meaning.<ref>Qur'an, 3:46.</ref><ref>;;[http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/quran-jesus.html Mike Tabish, ''What does the Qur'an say about Isa (Jesus)?'']</ref> Muslims dispute the historical occurrence of the crucifixion of Jesus (believing that while a crucifixion occurred, it was not of Jesus).<ref>Answering-Christianity.com, [http://www.answering-christianity.com/crucified.htm ''What does the Holy Qur'an say about Jesus (peace be upon him)''].</ref> Muslims also believe that while Islam's holy book, the [[Quran]], is the word of God, today's [[Bible]] has been corrupted because it has gone through a human editing process.<ref>Answering -Christianity.com [http://answering-christianity.com/contra.htm]</ref>
