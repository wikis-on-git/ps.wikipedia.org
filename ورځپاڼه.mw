{{ژباړل}}'''ورځپاڼه''' يوه داسې خپرونه ده چې په ځان کې ورځيني تاوده خبرونه، مالومات او خبرتياوې لري. اکثراً دغه مالومات په يو ټيټ-بيه کاغذ باندې چې د اخباري کاغذ په نامه يادېږي چاپېږي. ورځپاڼې کېدلای شي چې د ټولو او يا هم د يوې ځانګړې ګټې پخاطر، د دود له مخې هره ورځ او يا هم اوونيز خپرونې وکړي.
لومړنۍ چاپي ورځپاڼه په ۱۶۰۵ زېږيز کال کې خپره شوه، and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as [[radio]], [[television]], and the [[internet]]. Recent developments on the internet are, however, posing major challenges to the business model of many newspapers. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of most newspapers' income, is shifting from print to online, resulting in a general decline in newspaper profits. This has led to some predictions that newspapers’ role in society will shrink or even disappear, although historically, new media technologies such as radio and television never supplanted print media. 

==منځپانګه==
اکثراً د نوو خبرونو ژورنالونه د ټولو د پزړه پورتيا ورځپاڼې وي. په داسې ورځپاڼو کې سياسي پېښې، جنايي، سوداګريز، کلتوري، سپورتي او نظرياتي (که د [[سرمقالو]]، [[کالمونو]]، يا [[سياسي کارتونونو) ليکنې خپرېږي. ورځپاڼو کې پېښې په انځورونو څرګندېږة ددې تر څنګ د سرمقالې لپاره کارتونونه هم د يوه ليکل شوي نظر په اړه کارول کېږي، کوم چې اړين نه دی چې يو خبر وي.


په ورځپاڼو کې ځانګړي مطالب په دې توګه وي:

==د ورځپاڼې ډولونه==
يو '''ورځپاڼه''' هره ورځ خپرېږې، خو کله ناکله بيا د اوونۍ د پای ورځ او ملي رخصتۍ پکې استثنا وي. خو په ځينو هېوادونو کې بيا د شنبې او که چېرته يکشنبې هم د اوونۍ د پای رخصتيانې وي نو همدغو ورځو ته ځانګړې ورځپاڼې راوځي چې د نورو ورځو په پرتله لويې ګڼې وي، چې په  larger, include more specialized sections and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated.

'''[[اونيزه]]''' هم يو ډول خبري خپرونه وي چې په هره اوونۍ کې يو وار د بېلابېلو سکالوو خبرونه او نور نوي مالومات او خبرتياوې خپروي.

Most nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper''', as contrasted  with a '''local newspaper''' serving a city or region. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], there are few truly national newspapers, with the notable exceptions ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' in the US and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and ''[[National Post|The National Post]]'' in Canada. Large metropolitan newspapers with expanded distribution networks such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post|The Washington Post]]'' can fill the role of ''de facto'' national newspapers. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are numerous national newspapers, including ''[[The Independent]]'',''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The Daily Express]]'' and ''[[The Daily Mirror]]''.

As [[English language|English]] has become the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bombay]] ([[Mumbai]]), newspapers are printed to a local and international English-speaking public. The advent of the [[Internet]] has also allowed the non-English newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.

There is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterised as '''international newspapers'''. Some, such as ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' and ''The [[International Herald Tribune]]'', have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or “international editions” of national-scale or large metropolitan newspapers. Often these international editions are scaled down to remove articles that might not interest the wider range of readers. 

Job titles within the newspaper industry vary greatly. In the United States, the overall manager of the newspaper - sometimes also the owner - may be termed the [[publisher]]. This usage is less common outside the U.S., but throughout the English-speaking world the person responsible for content is usually referred to as the [[editing|editor]]. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on, are common.

While most newspapers are aimed at a broad spectrum of readers, usually geographically defined, some focus on groups of readers defined more by their interests than their location: for example, there are daily and weekly business newspapers and sports newspapers. More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, or the local gay community. 

Newspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising — the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial — or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel.

Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the ‘B’ section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press.  For example, both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content.  The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.[http://advertising.wsj.com/Rates/RatesPro.htm]

Most modern newspapers are in one of three sizes: 
* [[Broadsheet]]s: 600 mm by 380 mm (23½ by 15 [[inch]]es), generally associated with more [[intellectual]] newspapers, although a trend towards “compact” newspapers is changing this.
* [[Tabloid]]s: half the size of broadsheets at 380 mm by 300 mm (15 by 11¾ inches), and often perceived as [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] in contrast to broadsheets.
* [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] or [[Midi (newspaper)|Midi]]: 470 mm by 315 mm (18½ by 12¼ inches) used by [[Europe]]an papers such as ''[[Le Monde]]'' in [[France]], ''[[La Stampa]]'' in [[Italy]] and, since 12 September 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]].

Newspapers are usually printed on inexpensive, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, [[desktop computers]], [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital cameras]] and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[layout]]s and better design.

To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, the Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is printed on pink paper, while ''[[L'Équipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major [[cycling]] races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; thus, the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jer

==Online-only newspapers==
{{main|Online Newspaper}}
With the introduction of the internet, web based newspapers have also started to be produced as online only publications, like the ''[[Southport Reporter]]''<ref>Published in UK as the "UK's only web-based newspaper" in January 2005 in hard copy magazine called "Web Pages Made Easy."</ref>.  To be a Web-Only newspaper they must be web published only and must not be part of or have any connection to hard copy formats.  To be classed as a Online Only Newspaper the paper must also be regularly updated at a regular time and keep to a fixed news format, like a hardcopy newspaper.  They must also be only published by professional media companies and regarded under the national/international press rules and regulations <ref>[http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml Journalism Magazine] - "The UK [[PCC]] (Press Complaints Commission) before 2007 already regulated online editions of UK newspapers"</ref> unlike [[blog]] <ref>[http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&defl=en&q=define:Blog&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title Google Define Blog]</ref> sites. and other news websites it is run as a newspaper and is recognized by media groups in the UK, like the [[NUJ]] and/or the [[IFJ]].  Also they fall under the UK's PCC rules.

{{main|electronic paper}}

In February 2006, the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] daily ''[[De Tijd]]'' of [[Antwerp]] announced plans to distribute an electronic-ink version of the paper to selected subscribers. This will be the first such application of electronic ink to newspaper publishing. This type of electronic ink will be able to update any newspaper instantly.

== Circulation and readership ==
{{main|Newspaper circulation}}
The number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper’s circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free).

[[Image:Newspaper_vendor.jpg|thumb|250px|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], [[London]], February 2005]]

According to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in [[1990]], while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i fakty]]'' boasted the circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991.

According to [[United Nations]] data from 1995 [[Japan]] has three daily papers —the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' and ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]''— with circulations well above 4 million. [[Germany]]’s ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 4.5 million, was the only other paper in that category. 

In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.2 million copies distributed daily (late-2004).

In [[India]], ''The [[Times of India]]'' is the largest English newspaper, with 2.14 million copies daily. According to the 2006 National Readership Study, the ''Dainik Jagran'' is the most-read, local-language (Hindi) newspaper, with 21.2 million readers [http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200608291820.htm].

In the U.S., ''[[USA Today]]'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2 million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country. 

A common measure of a newspaper’s health is market penetration. Market penetration is expressed as a percentage of households that receive a copy of the newspaper against the total number of households in the paper’s market area. In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 130 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.3 newspapers). As other media, such as radio and television, began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent [http://www.stateofthenewsmedia.org/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&media=2 1].

Most newspapers make nearly all their money from [[advertising]]; the income from the customer’s payment at the news-stand is small in comparison. For that reason, newspapers are inexpensive to buy, and some are free. The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions.  In recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged.  Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third-parties pay a fee to have included in the paper.  [[Advertorial]]s commonly [[advertise]] new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]].

Publishers of commercial newspapers strive for higher circulation, so that advertising in their newspaper becomes more effective, allowing the newspaper to attract more advertisers and to charge more for the service. But some advertising sales also market demographics: some newspapers might sacrifice higher circulation numbers in favor of an audience with a higher income. 

Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a [[day|daily]] subscription.

Some newspapers provide some or all of their content on the internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.

== د ورځپاڼو خبريالي ==
Since newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''[[journalism]]''. Much emphasis has been placed upon the accuracy and fairness of the journalist — see [[Ethics]]. 

In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The more restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]].

Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and [[grammar]]; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.

In the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used either as a rich man’s [[toy]], or a [[politics|political]] tool. More recently in the United States, a greater number of newspapers (and all of the largest ones) are being run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]] (the largest in the United States), [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Cox]], [[LandMark]], [[Morris Corporation]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation]] etc. Many industry watchers have concerns that the growing need for profit growth natural to corporations will have a negative impact on the overall quality of journalism. 

There is no doubt, however, that newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who “leak” stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. 

Even though the opinions of the owners are often relegated to the ''editorial'' section, and the opinions of other writers and readers are in the [[op-ed|''op-ed'']] (“opposite the editorial page”) and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper, newspapers have been used for political purposes by insinuating some kind of bias outside of the editorial section and into straight ''news''. For example, ''[[The New York Times]]'' is often criticised for a perceived [[left-wing politics|leftist]] slant to its stories, or, by others, for supporting the American political establishment, whereas the opinion pages (but not the news pages) of the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' generally take [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] positions.

Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication. Many larger newspapers are now using more aggressive random fact-checking to further improve the chances that false information will be found before it is printed.

The future of newspapers is cloudy, with overall readership slowly declining in most developed countries due to increasing competition from television and the Internet. The 57th annual World Newspaper Congress, held in [[Istanbul]] in June 2004, reported circulation increases in only 35 of 208 countries studied. Most of the increases came in developing countries, notably China and India 

[[Image:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on [[Armistice Day]], November 11, 1918.]]
A report at the gathering indicated that China tops total newspaper circulation, with more than 85 million copies of papers sold every day, followed by India with 72 million&mdash;China and India are the two most populous countries in the world&mdash;followed by Japan with 70 million and the United States with 55 million. The report said circulation declined by an average of 2.2 percent across 13 of the 15 countries that made up the [[European Union]] before [[May 1]]. The biggest declines were in [[Ireland]], down 7.8 percent; Britain, down 4.7 percent; and [[Portugal]], where numbers fell by 4.0 percent. One growth area is the distribution of [[free daily newspaper]]s, which are not reflected in the above circulation data. Led by the [http://www.metro.lu Metro] chain of newspapers, they grew 16 percent in 2003.

Newspapers also face increased competition from internet sites such as ''[[Craigslist]]'' for [[classified ad]]s, especially for jobs, real estate, and cars, the advertising of which has long been key sources of newspaper revenue.  Also from online only newspapers.  Already in the UK a newspaper called [[Southport Reporter]] started out in 2000 and remains online as a recognized newspaper, but only published online and others now exist through out the world.   This opens the debate as to "What is a newspaper".  See [[Online Newspapers]].

However, many believe that the internet can itself be used to newspapers’ advantage. Again see [[online Newspapers]] also [[broadcast journalism]].
