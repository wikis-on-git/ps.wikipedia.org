After the assassination of his father in [[1977]], he inclined more towards the radical activities of [[Jamia Hafsa]] and [[Jamia Faridia]]. He became a renowned{{fact}} figure when the US-led [[War on Terror]] erupted in [[Afghanistan]], as he led a coalition of anti-war religious organizations in [[Pakistan]]. He opposed the Pakistani government's decision to be a part of the [[Coalition Forces]] in the [[Iraq War]], as well as Pakistan's commitment to fight terrorism.

Although he had a growing reputation in the anti-terrorism religious lobby in Pakistan, the Government of Pakistan accused him of planning a terrorist attack on important government buildings in Islamabad. His name was later removed from a list of suspects. On July 3, 2007, when a continued stand-off between [[Lal Masjid]] and government finally turned into the siege of [[Lal Masjid]] and [[Jamia Hafsa]], he refused to surrender to the security forces, instead making anti-government rhetoric through the world media. The government accused him of using the students, along with women in the mosque, as [[human shields]] for his protection.

He was the vice principal of [[Jamia Hafsa]] and [[Jamia Faridia]] [[madrassas]]. Under he and his brother's leadership, the two madrassas had become actively involved in challenging the writ of the government in the Pakistani capital, [[Islamabad]], setting up [[Taliban]]-style parallel radical judiciary inspired by [[Sharia Law]] and by instigating kidnappings, arson, and murder.<ref name="lalmasjidprfile">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6503477.stm Profile: Islamabad's red mosque]</ref> <ref name="lalmasjidi">[http://youtube.com/watch?v=3PCIeh1DOnk A report on Lal Masjid - Part I]</ref> <ref name="lalmasjidii">[http://youtube.com/watch?v=OUqKn24DmLE A report on Lal Masjid - Part II]</ref>
