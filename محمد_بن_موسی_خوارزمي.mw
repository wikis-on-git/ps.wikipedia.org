'''{{transl|ar|ALA|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī}}''' ({{lang-ar|محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]<ref>Toomer, Hogendijk 1997, Oaks</ref> [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[Islamic astrology|astrologer]] and [[geographer]]. He was born around 780 in [[Khwarezm|Khwārizm]]<ref>Berggren, Hogendijk, Struik p. 93</ref> (now [[Khiva]], [[Uzbekistan]]) and died around 850. He worked most of his life as a [[scholar]] in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]].

His ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' was the first book on the systematic solution of [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s. Consequently he is considered to be the father of [[algebra]],<ref>Gandz 1936</ref> a title he shares with [[Diophantus]]. [[Latin]] translations of his ''Arithmetic'', on the [[Indian numerals]], introduced the [[decimal]] [[Positional notation|positional number system]] to the [[Western world]] in the 12th century.<ref>Struik p. 93</ref> He revised and updated [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Geography'' as well as writing several works on astronomy and astrology.

His contributions not only made a great impact on mathematics, but on language as well. The word algebra is derived from ''al-jabr'', one of the two operations used to solve [[quadratic equations]], as described in his book. The words ''[[algorism]]'' and ''[[algorithm]]'' stem from ''algoritmi'', the [[Latinization]] of his name.<ref>al-Daffa 1978</ref> His name is also the origin of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''guarismo''<ref>*Donald E. Knuth, [http://historical.ncstrl.org/litesite-data/stan/CS-TR-80-786.pdf ''Algorithms in Modern Mathematics and Computer Science'']. Springer-Verlag. 1979. ISBN 0-387-11157-3.</ref> and of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''algarismo'', both meaning [[digit]].

Few details about al-Khwārizmī's life are known; it is not even certain where he was born.  His name indicates he might have come from [[Khwarizm]] (Khiva) in the [[Khorasan]] province of the [[Abbasid]] empire (now [[Xorazm Province]] of [[Uzbekistan]]).

His [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] is given as either ''{{Unicode|Abū ʿAbd Allāh}}'' (Arabic: {{ar|أبو عبد الله}}) or ''{{Unicode|Abū Jaʿfar}}''.<ref>possibly because it is mistaken with that of {{unicode|[[Muhammad bin Musa|Ǧaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Šākir]]}}. M. Dunlop. ''{{unicode|Muḥammad b. Mūsā al-Khwārizmī}}''. JRAS 1943 p. 248-250).</ref>

The [[historian]] [[al-Tabari]] gave his name as Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwārizmī al-Majousi al-Katarbali (Arabic: {{ar|محمد بن موسى الخوارزميّ المجوسيّ القطربّليّ}}). The [[epithet]] ''al-Qutrubbulli'' indicates he might instead have came from [[Qutrubbull]], a small town near [[Baghdad]]. Regarding al-Khwārizmī's religion, Toomer writes:
<blockquote>
Another epithet given to him by al-Ṭabarī, "al-Majūsī," would seem to indicate that he was an adherent of the old Zoroastrian religion. This would still have been possible at that time for a man of Iranian origin, but the pious preface to al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'' shows that he was an orthodox [[Muslim]], so al-Ṭabarī's epithet could mean no more than that his forebears, and perhaps he in his youth, had been Zoroastrians.<ref>Toomer</ref>
</blockquote>

In [[Ibn al-Nadīm]]'s ''Kitāb al-Fihrist'' we find a short biography on al-Khwārizmī, together with a list of the books he wrote{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work in the period between 813 and 833. After the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]], Baghdad became the centre of scientific studies and trade, and many merchants and scientists, from as far as [[China]] and [[History of India|India]] traveled to this city--as such apparently so did Al-Khwārizmī. He worked in Baghdad as a scholar at the [[House of Wisdom]] established by [[Caliph]] {{unicode|[[al-Maʾmūn]]}}, where he studied the sciences and mathematics, which included the translation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]] scientific manuscripts.

His major contributions to [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[geography]] and [[cartography]] provided foundations for later and even more widespread innovation in [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], and his other areas of interest. His systematic and logical approach to solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s gave shape to the discipline of ''algebra'', a word that is derived from the name of his 830 book on the subject, ''al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa'l-muqabala'' ([[Arabic]] الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة) or: "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing". The book was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century.

His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' written about 825, was principally responsible for the diffusion of the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Indian system of numeration]] in the [[Middle-East]] and then [[Europe]]. This book also translated into Latin in the twelfth century, as ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. From the name of the author, rendered in Latin as ''algoritmi'', originated the term [[algorithm]].

Some of his contributions were based on earlier [[Iran|Persian]] and [[Babylonian]] [[Astronomy]], [[Indian numerals|Indian numbers]], and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] sources.

Al-Khwārizmī systematized and corrected [[Ptolemy]]'s data in [[geography]] as regards to [[Africa]] and the [[Middle east]]. Another major book was his ''Kitab surat al-ard'' ("The Image of the Earth"; translated as Geography), which presented the coordinates of localities in the known world based, ultimately, on those in the Geography of [[Ptolemy]] but with improved values for the length of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the location of cities in Asia and Africa.

He also assisted in the construction of a world map for the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] and participated in a project to determine the circumference of the Earth, supervising the work of 70 geographers to create the [[map]] of the then "known world".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045366 Encyclopedia Britannica. ''al-Khwarizmi''.]</ref>

When his work was copied and transferred to [[Europe]] through [[Latin]] translations, it had a profound impact on the advancement of basic mathematics in [[Europe]]. He also wrote on mechanical devices like the <!-- [[clock]], al-Biruni? -->[[astrolabe]] and [[sundial]]. <!-- His other contributions include tables of [[trigonometric function]]s, refinements in the geometric representation of [[conic sections]], and aspects of the [[calculus of two errors]]. More al-Biruni? al-Khwārizmī's made a table of sien values. -->

{{main|The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing}}
[[Image:Al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa-l-muqabala.jpg|thumb|right|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
''{{Unicode|al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wa-l-muqābala}}'' (Arabic: الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة “The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion <!-- <small>(variants: Restoring, Reuniting)</small> -->and Balancing”) is a [[mathematical]] book written approximately [[830]] CE.

The book is considered to have defined [[algebra]]. The word ''[[algebra]]'' is derived from the name of one of the basic operations with equations (''al-jabr'') described in this book. The book was translated in Latin as ''Liber algebrae et almucabala'' by [[Robert of Chester]] ([[Segovia]], 1145)<ref>mactutor-hanasi</ref> hence "algebra", and also by [[Gerard of Cremona]]. A unique Arabic copy is kept at Oxford and was translated in 1831 by F. Rosen. A latin translation is kept is Cambridge.<ref>[[L. C. Karpinski]] (1912). "History of Mathematics in the Recent Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica". ''American Association for the Advancement of Science''.</ref>

Al-Khwārizmī's method of solving linear and quadratic equations worked by first reducing the equation to one of six standard forms (where ''b'' and ''c'' are positive integers)
* squares equal roots (''ax''<sup>2</sup> = ''bx'')
* squares equal number (''ax''<sup>2</sup> = ''c'')
* roots equal number (''bx'' = ''c'')
* squares and roots equal number (''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' = ''c'')
* squares and number equal roots (''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''c'' = ''bx'')
* roots and number equal squares (''bx'' + ''c'' = ''ax''<sup>2</sup>)

by dividing out the coefficient of the square and using the two operations ''{{unicode|al-ǧabr}}'' (Arabic: الجبر “restoring” or “completion”) and ''al-muqābala'' ("balancing"). {{unicode|Al-ǧabr}} is the process of removing negative units, roots and squares from the equation by adding the same quantity to each side. For example, ''x''<sup>2</sup> = 40''x'' - 4''x''<sup>2</sup> is reduced to 5''x''<sup>2</sup> = 40''x''. Al-muqābala is the process of bringing quantities of the same type to the same side of the equation. For example, ''x''<sup>2</sup>+14 = ''x''+5 is reduced to ''x''<sup>2</sup>+9 = ''x''.

Several authors have published texts under the name of ''{{unicode|Kitāb al-ǧabr wa-l-muqābala}}'', including {{unicode|[[Abū Ḥanīfa al-Dīnawarī]], [[Abū Kāmil]] (''Rasāla fi al-ǧabr wa-al-muqābala''), [[Abū Muḥammad al-ʿAdlī]], [[Abū Yūsuf al-Miṣṣīṣī]], [[Ibn Turk]], [[Sind ibn ʿAlī]], [[Sahl ibn Bišr]] (author uncertain), and [[Šarafaddīn al-Ṭūsī]]}}.

[[Image:Dixit_algorizmi.png|thumb|Page from a Latin translation, beginning with "Dixit algorizmi"]]
Al-Khwārizmī's second major work was on the subject of arithmetic, which survived in a [[Latin]] translation but was lost in the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The translation was most likely done in the 12th century by [[Adelard of Bath]], who had also translated the astronomical tables in 1126.

The Latin manuscripts are untitled, but are commonly referred to by the first two words with which they start: ''Dixit algorizmi'' ("So said al-Khwārizmī"), or ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum'' ("al-Khwārizmī on the Hindu Art of Reckoning"), a name given to the work by [[Baldassarre Boncompagni]] in 1857. The original Arabic title was possibly ''{{unicode|Kitāb al-Jamʿ wa-l-tafrīq bi-ḥisāb al-Hind}}''<ref>Ruska 1917</ref> ("The Book of Addition and Subtraction According to the Hindu Calculation")<ref>Berggren, p. 7</ref>

[[Image:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|A 15th century map based on Ptolomy's ''Geography'' for comparison.]]

Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his ''{{unicode|Kitāb ṣūrat al-Arḍ}}'' (Arabic: كتاب صورة الأرض "Book on the appearance of the Earth" or "The image of the Earth" translated as ''Geography''), which was finished in 833. It is a revised and completed version of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction.<ref>[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Cartography.html MacTutor: Cartography]</ref>

There is only one surviving copy of ''{{unicode|Kitāb ṣūrat al-Arḍ}}'', which is kept at the [[Strasbourg University Library]]. A Latin translation is kept at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]] in [[Madrid]]. The complete title translates as ''Book of the appearance of the Earth, with its cities, mountains, seas, all the islands and rivers, written by Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwārizmī, according to the geographical treatise written by Ptolemy the Claudian''.<ref>In al-Khwārizmī's opinion, "the Claudian" indicated that Ptolemy was a descendent of the emperor Claudius.</ref>

The book opens with the list of [[latitudes]] and [[longitudes]], in order of "[[weather zones]]", that is to say in blocks of latitudes and, in each weather zone, by order of longitude. As [[Paul Gallez]] points out, this excellent system allows us to deduce many latitudes and longitudes where the only document in our possession is in such a bad condition as to make it practically illegible.

Neither the Arabic copy nor the Latin translation include the map of the world itself, however [[Hubert Daunicht]] was able to reconstruct the missing map from the list of coordinates. Daunicht read the latitudes and longitudes of the coastal points in the manuscript, or deduces them from the context where they were not legible. He transferred the points onto [[graph paper]] and connected them with straight lines, obtaining an approximation of the coastline as it was on the original map. He then does the same for the rivers and towns.<ref>Daunicht 1968</ref>

<!--One of the corrections which al-Khwārizmī made in Ptolemy's work is the reduction of the latitude of the [[Mediterranean]] from 62° to 52° when, in actual fact, it should be only 42°. The Arab opts for the same zero meridian as Ptolemy, that of the [[Canaries]]. The amount of inhabited land extends over 180°.

The majority of the placenames used by al-Khwārizmī match those of Ptolemy, [[Martellus]] and [[Behaim]]. The general shape of the coastline is the same between [[Taprobane]] and [[Cattigara]]. The Atlantic coast of the [[Dragon's Tail]], which does not exist in Ptolemy's map, is traced in very little detail on al-Khwārizmī's map, but is clear and precise on the [[Martellus map]] and on the later [[Behaim]] version.-->

{{unicode|Al-Khwārizmī's ''Zīj al-sindhind''}} <!-- Toomer --> (Arabic: زيج "astronomical tables") is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of [[sine]] values.  This is one of many Arabic [[zij]]es based on the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomical]] methods known as the ''sindhind''.<ref>Kennedy, ''Islamic Astronomical Tables'', pp. 26-9</ref>

The original Arabic version (written c. 820) is lost, but a version by the Spanish astronomer [[Maslama al-Majrīṭī]] (c. 1000) has survived in a Latin translation, presumably by [[Adelard of Bath]] (January 26, 1126).<ref>Neugebauer 1962</ref> The four surviving manuscripts of the Latin translation are kept at the Bibliothèque publique (Chartres), the Bibliothèque Mazarine (Paris), the Bibliotheca Nacional (Madrid) and the Bodleian Library (Oxford).

=== يهودي کاليزه===
Al-Khwārizmī wrote several other works including a treatise on the [[Jewish calendar]] (''{{unicode|Risāla fi istikhrāj taʾrīkh al-yahūd}}'' "Extraction of the Jewish Era"). It describes the [[Metonic cycle|19-year intercalation cycle]], the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month [[Tishrei|Tishrī]] shall fall; calculates the interval between the [[Anno Mundi|Jewish era]] (creation of Adam) and the [[Seleucid era]]; and gives rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon using the Jewish calendar. Similar material is found in the works of [[al-Bīrūnī]] and [[Maimonides]]. <!-- Toomer and Folkerts / More in Kenedy / Only Sezgin mentions "risala fi" -->

=== نور کارونه ===

Several Arabic manuscripts in Berlin, Istanbul, Taschkent, Cairo and Paris contain further material that surely or with some probability comes from al-Khwārizmī. The Istanbul manuscript contains a paper on sundials, which is mentioned in the ''Fihirst''. Other papers, such as one on the determination of the direction of [[Mecca]], are on the [[spherical astronomy]].

Two texts deserve special interest on the [[morning width]] (''Maʿrifat saʿat al-mashriq fī kull balad'') and the determination of the [[azimuth]] from a height <!-- Bestimmung des Azimuts aus der Höhe --> (''Maʿrifat al-samt min qibal al-irtifāʿ''). <!-- see Rosenfeld 1993 -->

He also wrote two books on using and constructing [[astrolabe]]s. [[Ibn al-Nadim]] in his ''{{unicode|[[Kitab al-Fihrist]]}}'' (an index of Arabic books) also mentions ''{{unicode|Kitāb ar-Ruḵāma(t)}}'' (the book on [[sundial]]s) and ''{{unicode|Kitab al-Tarikh}}'' (the book of [[history]]) but the two have been lost.
