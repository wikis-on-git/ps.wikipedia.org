The '''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan''', commonly called '''Jordan''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{ar|&#1571;&#1585;&#1583;&#1606;&#1617;}}, [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''&#700;Urdunn''), is an [[Arab world|Arab]] country in the [[Middle East]]. It is bordered by [[سوريه]] to the north, [[عراق]] to the north-east, [[سعودي عربستان]] to the east and south, and [[اسرايل]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] to the west. It shares with [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] the coastlines of the [[Dead Sea]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] with [[Israel]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Egypt]].

== تاريخ==
{{main|History of Jordan}}

The land that became Jordan forms part of the history-rich [[Fertile Crescent]] region. Its known history began around 2000 B.C., when [[Semitic]] [[Amorite]]s settled around the [[Jordan River]] in the area called [[Canaan]]. Subsequent invaders and settlers included [[Hittites]], [[Egypt]]ians, [[Israelite]]s, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Iran|Persia]]ns, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arab Muslims, Christian Crusaders, [[Mameluks]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks, and, finally, the British. At the end of [[World War I]], the territory now comprising [[Israel]], Jordan, the [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]], and [[Jerusalem]] was awarded to the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[League of Nations]] as the [[British Mandate of Palestine|mandate for Palestine]]. In 1922, in an attempt to assuage Arab anger resulting from the [[Balfour Declaration]], with the approval of the League of Nations, the British created the semi-autonomous Arab Emirate of Transjordan in all Palestinian territory east of the Jordan river.  The British installed the [[Hashemite]] Prince [[Abdullah I of Jordan]], while continuing the administration of Palestine and Transjordan under a single British High Commissioner. The mandate over Transjordan ended on [[22 May]] [[1946]]; on [[25 May]], the country became the independent Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. It ended its special defense treaty relationship with the United Kingdom in 1957.

Transjordan opposed the creation of Israel in May 1948, and took part in the warfare between the Arab states and the newly founded State of Israel. The armistice agreements of [[3 April]] [[1949]] left Jordan in control of the West Bank and provided that the armistice demarcation lines were without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines.

In 1950, Transjordan annexed the West Bank, and the country was renamed "the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan" to reflect this. The annexation was recognised only by the United Kingdom.

In the year [[1965]] there was an exchange of territories between [[Saudi Arabia]] and Jordan. Jordan gave up a relatively large area of inland desert in return for a small piece of sea-shore near Aqaba.

Jordan signed a mutual defense pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated in the [[Six Day War|June 1967 war]] against [[Israel]] along with [[Syria]], Egypt, and [[Iraq]]. During the war, Jordan lost its control of the [[West Bank]] and all of [[Jerusalem]]. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement, and its 1994 treaty with Israel allowed for a continuing Jordanian role in Muslim and Christian holy places in Jerusalem. The international community as represented in the [[United Nations]] considers the West Bank to be territory occupied by Israel and believes that its final status should be determined through direct negotiations among the parties concerned on the basis of [[UN]] Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.

The 1967 war led to a dramatic increase in the number of Palestinians, especially from the West Bank, living in Jordan. Its Palestinian refugee population &ndash; 700,000 in 1966 &ndash; grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank. The period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian resistance elements (''fedayeen'') in Jordan. The heavily armed ''fedayeen'' constituted a growing threat to the sovereignty and security of the Hashemite state, and open fighting erupted in June 1970. The battle in which Palestinian fighters from various [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) groups were expelled from Jordan is commonly known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]].

Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September, continuing ''fedayeen'' actions in Jordan &ndash; including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and held in the desert east of [[Amman]] &ndash; prompted the government to take action to regain control over its territory and population. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force took up positions in northern Jordan to support the ''fedayeen'' but subsequently retreated. By [[22 September]], Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces led by [[Habis Al-Majali]] won a decisive victory over the ''fedayeen'' in July 1971, expelling them from the country.

At the [[Rabat summit conference]] in 1974, Jordan agreed, along with the rest of the [[Arab League]], that the PLO was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank Palestinians.

No fighting occurred along the 1967 Jordan River cease-fire line during the [[Yom Kippur War|October 1973 Arab-Israeli war]], but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory. Jordan did not participate in the [[Gulf War]] of 1990-91. In 1991, Jordan agreed, along with Syria, [[Lebanon]], and [[Palestinian]] representatives, to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel at the [[Madrid Conference]], sponsored by the U.S. and [[Russia]]. It negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on [[July 25]], [[1994]] (see [[Washington Declaration]]). As a result, an [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty]] was concluded on [[October 26]], [[1994]]. Following the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000, the Jordanian government offered its good offices to both parties. Jordan has since sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbours.

On [[November 9]], [[2005]], Jordan experienced [[2005 Amman bombings|three simultaneous bombings]] at hotels in Amman.  At least 57 people died and 115 were wounded. [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[Iraq]], a group led by native Jordanian [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], claimed responsibility.

== سياست==
{{main|Politics of Jordan}}

Jordan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] based on the [[constitution]] promulgated on [[January 8]], [[1952]]. [[Executive authority]] is vested in the [[King of Jordan|king]] and his council of ministers. The king signs and executes all [[law]]s. His [[veto]] power may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the [[National Assembly]]. He appoints and may dismiss all judges by decree, approves [[constitutional amendment|amendment]]s to the constitution, declares [[war]], and commands the [[Military of Jordan|armed forces]]. [[Cabinet]] decisions, [[court]] judgments, and the national [[currency]] are issued in his name. The council of ministers, led by a [[prime minister]], is appointed by the king, who may dismiss other cabinet members at the prime minister's request. The cabinet is responsible to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]] on matters of general policy and can be forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of "no confidence" by that body.

[[Legislature|Legislative]] power rests in the [[bicameral]] National Assembly. The 110-member Chamber of Deputies, elected by [[universal suffrage]] to a 4-year term, is subject to dissolution by the king. Nine seats are reserved for Christians, 6 for women, and three for [[Circassians]] and [[Chechens]]. The 40-member [[Senate]] is appointed by the king for an 8-year term.

The constitution provides for three categories of courts &ndash; [[civil court|civil]], religious, and special. Administratively, Jordan is divided into eight [[governor]]ates, each headed by a governor appointed by the king. They are the sole authorities for all government departments and development projects in their respective areas.

[[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] ruled Jordan from 1953 to 1999, surviving a number of challenges to his rule, drawing on the loyalty of his military, and serving as a symbol of unity and stability for both the [[East Bank]] and [[Palestinian]] communities in Jordan. King Hussein ended [[martial law]] in 1991 and [[Legalization|legalized]] [[Political party|political parties]] in 1992. In 1989 and 1993, Jordan held free and fair [[parliament]]ary elections. Controversial changes in the election law led [[Islam]]ist parties to boycott the 1997 elections. 

[[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] succeeded his father Hussein following the latter's death in February 1999. Abdullah moved quickly to reaffirm Jordan's [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|peace treaty]] with [[Israel]] and its relations with the [[United States]]. Abdullah, during the first year in power, refocused the government's agenda on economic reform.

Jordan's continuing structural economic difficulties, burgeoning population, and more open political environment led to the emergence of a variety of political parties. Moving toward greater independence, Jordan's parliament has investigated corruption charges against several regime figures and has become the major forum in which differing political views, including those of political Islamists, are expressed. While King Abdullah remains the ultimate authority in Jordan, the parliament plays an important role.[[Image:Jordan.geohive.gif|thumb|390px|right|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]

== جغرافيه==
{{main|Geography of Jordan}}

Jordan is a [[Middle East]]ern country, bordered by [[Syria]] to the north, [[Iraq]] to the northeast, [[Saudi Arabia]] to the east and south and [[Israel]] and [[West Bank]] to the west. All these border lines add up to 1,619 kilometres (1,006&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]). The [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and the [[Dead Sea]] also touch the country, and thus Jordan has a coastline of 26 kilometres (16&nbsp;mi).[[Image:Jo-map.png|thumb|Map of Jordan]]

Jordan consists mostly of arid [[desert]] plateau in the east, with Highland area in the west. The [[Great Rift Valley]] of the [[Jordan River]] separates Jordan and Israel. The highest point in the country is [[Jabal Ram]] (1,734&nbsp;m; 5,689&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]), while the lowest is the Dead Sea (-486&nbsp;m; -1,594&nbsp;ft). Jordan is considered to be part of the "[[Humanity|cradle of humanity]]".

Major cities include the capital [[Amman]] in the northwest, [[Irbid]] and [[Az Zarqa]], both in the north.

The climate in Jordan is dry and hot, since the country is mainly desert. However, the western part of the country receives greater precipitation during the rainy season from November to April.

{{main|Economy of Jordan}}

Jordan is a small country with limited natural resources. The country is currently exploring ways to expand its limited water supply and use its existing water resources more efficiently, including through regional cooperation. Jordan also depends on external sources for the majority of its energy requirements. During the 1990s, its crude petroleum needs were met through imports from Iraq and neighboring countries. Since early 2003, oil has been provided by some [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] member countries. In addition, a natural gas pipeline from Egypt to the southern port city of [[Aqaba]] was completed in 2003. The government plans to extend this pipeline north to the Amman area and beyond. Since 2000, exports of light manufactured products, principally textiles and garments manufactured in the Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) that enter the United States tariff and quota free, have been driving economic growth. Jordan exported €5.6 million ($6.9 million) in goods to the U.S. in 1997, when two-way trade was €321 million ($395 million); it exported €538 million ($661 million) in 2002 with two-way trade at €855 million ($1.05 billion). Similar growth in exports to the United States under the bilateral [[Free Trade Agreement]] that went into effect in December 2001, to the European Union under the bilateral Association Agreement, and to countries in the region, holds considerable promise for diversifying Jordan's economy away from its traditional reliance on exports of phosphates and potash, overseas remittances, and foreign aid. The government has emphasized the information technology (IT) and tourism sectors as other promising growth sectors. The low tax and low regulation Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) is considered a model of a government-provided framework for private sector-led economic growth.

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States that went into effect in December 2001 will phase out duties on nearly all goods and services by 2010. The agreement also provides for more open markets in communications, construction, finance, health, transportation, and services, as well as strict application of international standards for the protection of intellectual property. In 1996, Jordan and the United States signed a civil aviation agreement that provides for "open skies" between the two countries, and a U.S.-Jordan treaty for the protection and encouragement of bilateral investment entered into force in 2003. Jordan has been a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] since 2000. More information on the FTA is available on [http://www.jordanusfta.com].

Jordan is classified by the [[World Bank]] as a "lower middle income country." The per capita [[GDP]] was approximately $1,817 (€1,479) for 2003 and 14.5% of the economically active population, on average, was unemployed in 2003. Education and literacy rates and measures of social well-being are relatively high compared to other countries with similar incomes. Jordan's population growth rate is high, but has declined in recent years, to approximately 2.8% currently. One of the most important factors in the government’s efforts to improve the well-being of its citizens is the macroeconomic stability that has been achieved since the 1990s. Rates of price inflation are low, at 2.3% in 2003, and the currency has been stable with an exchange rate fixed to the U.S. dollar since 1995.

While pursuing economic reform and increased trade, Jordan's economy will continue to be vulnerable to external shocks and regional unrest. Without calm in the region, economic growth seems destined to stay below  potential. On the positive side, however, there is huge potential in the solar energy falling on Jordan's deserts, not only for the generation of pollution-free electricity but also for such spin-offs as desalination of sea water (see [[Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation]] (TREC)).

==باندنۍ اړيکې==
Jordan has consistently followed a pro-Western foreign policy and traditionally has had close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. These relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and maintaining relations with Iraq during the first [[Gulf War]]. Although the Government of Jordan stated its opposition to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, popular support for Iraq was driven by Jordan's Palestinian community, which favored Saddam as a champion against Western supporters of Israel.

Following the Gulf war, Jordan largely restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the Middle East peace process and enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq. Relations between Jordan and the Gulf countries improved substantially after King Hussein's death. Following the fall of the Iraqi regime, Jordan has played a pivotal role in supporting the restoration of stability and security to Iraq. The Government of Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding with the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq to facilitate the training of up to 30,000 Iraqi police cadets at a Jordanian facility.

Jordan signed a nonbelligerency agreement with Israel (the Washington Declaration) in Washington, DC, on [[25 July]] [[1994]]. [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Jordan and Israel signed a historic peace treaty]] on [[26 October]] [[1994]], witnessed by President [[Bill Clinton]], accompanied by Secretary [[Warren Christopher]]. The U.S. has participated with Jordan and Israel in trilateral development discussions in which key issues have been water-sharing and security; cooperation on Jordan Rift Valley development; infrastructure projects; and trade, finance, and banking issues. Jordan also participates in the multilateral peace talks. Jordan belongs to the UN and several of its specialized and related agencies, including the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and World Health Organization (WHO). Jordan also is a member of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Nonaligned Movement (NAM), and Arab League.

Since the outbreak of the [[Intifada]] in September 2000, Jordan has worked hard, in a variety of forums, to maintain lines of communication between the Israelis and the Palestinians to counsel moderation and to return the parties to negotiations of outstanding permanent status issues.

Following the Intifada, though, Jordan along with Egypt withdrew its ambassadors from Israel.  Following the Sharm-al-Sheik Summit in Egypt on [[8 February]] [[2005]], both countries announced plans to return ambassadors to the country.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Jordan}}

Most Jordanians are primarily of indigenous [[Levantine]] [[Semitic]] stock, admixed with various other peoples who have through its history come to conquer or settle the area &mdash; principally [[Arabian]]s (also a Semitic people) during the [[Islamic]] expansionism that brought Arab culture, language and the [[Islam|Muslim]] faith. There are also a few smaller communities of [[Chechens]], [[Circassians]], [[Assyrians]], [[Armenians]], and [[Kurds]], some of which have also adapted to Arab culture. The official language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but [[English language|English]] is used widely in commerce and government. About 70% of Jordan's population is urban; less than 6% of the rural population is [[nomadic]] or semi-nomadic. Most people live where the rainfall supports agriculture. About 2.6 million persons registered as [[Palestinian]] refugees and displaced persons reside in Jordan, most as citizens.
