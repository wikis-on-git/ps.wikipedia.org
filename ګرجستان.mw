'''جيورجيا''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: საქართველო ''Sak'art'velo''), known officially from [[1990]] to [[1995]] as the '''د جيورجيا جمهوريت''', is a country to the east of the [[Black Sea]], most of which is located in the [[South Caucasus|South]] [[Caucasus]], while a portion of the territory lies in the [[North Caucasus]]. A former republic of the [[Soviet Union]], it shares borders with [[روسيه]] in the north and [[Turkey]], [[ارمنستان]], and [[آذربايجان]] in the south.

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د جيورجيا تاريخ}}

===Antiquity===
Two Georgian Kingdoms of late [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], known to Greece and Rome as [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] in the east of the country and [[Colchis]] in the west, were among the first nations in the region to adopt [[Christianity]] ([[317]] AD and [[523]] AD, respectively).  Colchis, known to its natives as [[Egrisi]] or [[Lazica]], often saw [[Lazic War|battles]] between the rival power of [[Iran|Persia]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], both of which managed to conquer Western Georgia from time to time. As a result, those Kingdoms disintegrated into various feudal regions in the early [[Middle Ages]]. This made it easy for [[Arabs]] to conquer Georgia in the [[7th century]].  The rebellious regions were liberated and united into the Georgian Kingdom at the beginning of the [[11th century]]. Starting in the [[12th century]] the rule of Georgia extended over the significant part of Southern [[Caucasus]], including northeastern parts and almost entire northern coast of what is now [[Turkey]].

===Mediaeval===
This '''Georgian Kingdom''', which was tolerant towards its [[Muslim]] and [[Jew]]ish subjects (who had already been settled there for many centuries), was subordinated by the [[Mongols]] in the [[13th century]]. Thereafter, different local rulers fought for their independence from the central Georgian rule, until the total disintegration of the Kingdom in the [[15th century]]. Neighbouring kingdoms exploited the situation and from the [[16th century]] the [[Persian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] subordinated the eastern and western regions of Georgia, respectively.

[[Image:St Mamas tondo, Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|Tondo depicting [[Saint Mamas]] from the [[Gelati Monastery]], 14th-15th centuries]]
The rulers of regions, which remained partly [[Autonomous entity| autonomous]], organised rebellions on various occasions. Subsequent Persian and Turkish invasions further weakened local kingdoms and regions. 

As a result of wars against the neighbouring countries the population of Georgia was reduced to 250 000 inhabitants at one point .

===Russian subjugation===
In [[1783]] Russia and the eastern Georgian kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], according to which Kartl-Kakheti received protection by Russia. This, however, did not prevent [[Tbilisi]] being sacked by the Persians in [[1795]]. 



On December 22, 1800 Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]], at the alleged request of the Georgian king George XII, signed the Proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartl-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire. The Proclamation was announced on [[January 18]], [[1801]].

While some of the Georgian nobility accepted this declaration,  others organized anti-Russian activities on several occasions <ref> Anchabadze (2005), p.29, Suny (2004), pp. 65-6 </ref>

In the summer [[1805]]  Russian troops on the river Askerani and near Zagam defeated the Persian army and saved [[Tbilisi]] from conquest.

In [[1810]], after a brief war <ref> Anchabadze (2005), p. 29 </ref>, the western Georgian [[kingdom of Imereti]] was annexed by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]]. The last Imeretian king and the last Georgian [[Bagratid]] ruler [[Solomon II of Imereti|Solomon II]] died in exile in [[1815]]. From [[1803]] to [[1878]], as a result of numerous Russian wars against [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]], several territories were annexed to Georgia. These areas ([[Batumi]], [[Artvin]], [[Akhaltsikhe]], [[Poti]], and [[Abkhazia]]) now represent the majority of the territory of Georgia.

[[Image:Ananuri castle church.jpg|thumb|[[Ananuri]] castle and church in the picturesque Aragvi gorge]]
The principality of [[Guria]] was abolished in [[1828]], and that of [[Samegrelo]] (Mingrelia) in [[1857]]. The region of [[Svaneti]] was gradually annexed in [[1857]]–[[1859]].

===The Soviet period===
After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] Georgia declared independence on [[May 26]], [[1918]] in the midst of the [[Russian Civil War]]. The parliamentary election was won by the Georgian Social-Democratic Party and its leader, [[Noe Zhordania]], became the prime minister. The country's independence did not last long, however. In February [[1921]] Georgia was attacked by the [[Red Army]]. Georgian troops lost the battle and the Social-Democrat government fled the country. On [[February 25]] [[1921]] the [[Red Army]] entered the capital [[Tbilisi]] and installed a puppet communist government led by Georgian Bolshevik [[Filipp Makharadze]]. Georgia was incorporated into a [[Transcaucasian Federative Soviet Socialist Republic]] uniting Georgia, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The TFSSR was disaggregated into its component elements in [[1936]] and Georgia became the [[Georgian SSR]].

[[Image:Gelati.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gelati Monastery]], World Heritage site]]
The Georgian-born radical [[Ioseb Jughashvili]] was prominent among the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s, who came to power in the Russian Empire after the [[October Revolution]] in [[1917]].  Jughashvili was better known by his [[nom de guerre]] ''Stalin'' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for steel: сталь). [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was to rise to the highest position of the [[Soviet]] state and to rule ruthlessly.

From [[1941]] to [[1945]], during the [[World War II|Second World War]], almost 700,000 Georgians fought as Red Army soldiers against [[Nazi Germany]]. (A number also fought with the German army). About 350,000 Georgians died in the battlefields of the [[eastern front]]. Also during this period the [[Chechen]], [[Ingush]], [[Karachay]] and the [[Balkarian]] peoples from the Northern [[Caucasus]], were deported to [[Siberia]] for alleged collaboration with the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. With their respective autonomous republics abolished, the [[Georgian SSR]] was briefly granted some of their territory, until [[1957]].

The Georgian [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], the [[USSR]]'s Georgian minister for foreign affairs, was one of the main architects of the [[Perestroika]] reforms of the late [[1980s]]. During this period, Georgia developed a vigorous multiparty system that strongly favoured independence. The country staged the first democratic, multiparty parliamentary elections in the [[Soviet Union]] on [[October 28]], [[1990]]. From [[November]] [[1990]] to [[March]] [[1991]], one of the leaders of the National Liberation movement, Dr. [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] (1939-1993), was the Chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia]] (the Georgian parliament).
[[Image:Gremi castle and church, Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gremi]] castle and church in [[Kakheti]], 1565]]

===Independence===
On [[April 9]], [[1991]], shortly before the collapse of the USSR, Georgia declared independence. On [[May 26]], [[1991]] [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] was elected as a first President of independent Georgia. However, Gamsakhurdia was deposed in a bloody [[coup d'etat]], from [[December 22]], [[1991]] to [[January 6]], [[1992]]. The coup was instigated by part of the National Guards and a paramilitary organization called "[[Mkhedrioni]]" which allegedly was supported by Russian military units stationed in Tbilisi. The country became embroiled in a bitter civil war which lasted almost until 1995. Shevardnadze returned to Georgia in 1992 and joined the leaders of the coup &mdash; Kitovani and Ioseliani &mdash; to head a triumvirate called the “State Council”.

In 1995 Shevardnadze was officially elected as a president of Georgia. At the same time, two regions of Georgia,  [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], quickly became embroiled in disputes with local separatists that led to widespread inter-ethnic violence and wars. Supported by [[Russia]], [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] achieved and maintained ''de facto'' independence from Georgia. More than 250,000 Georgians were ''ethnically cleansed'' from [[Abkhazia]] by Abkhaz separatists and North Caucasians volunteers, (including Chechens) in 1992-1993. More than 25,000 Georgians were expelled from [[Tskhinvali]] as well, and many Ossetian families were forced to abandon their homes in the [[Borjomi]] region and move to Russia. 

In 2003 Shevardnadze was deposed by the [[Rose Revolution]], after Georgian opposition and international monitors asserted that the November 2 parliamentary elections were marred by fraud.[http://eurasinet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav112204a.shtml] The revolution was led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], [[Zurab Zhvania]] and [[Nino Burjanadze]],  former members and leaders of Shavarnadze's ruling party. Saakashvili was elected as  President of Georgia in 2004. Restoring Georgia's territorial integrity, reversing the effects of ethnic cleansing and returning refugees to their home places were the main pre-election promises of Saakashvili's government.

Following the Rose Revolution, a series of reforms was launched to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities. The new government's efforts to reassert the Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of [[Ajaria]] led to a major [[Ajaria Crisis|crisis]] early in 2004. Success in Ajaria encouraged Saakashvili to intensify his efforts, but without success, in the breakaway [[South Ossetia]].

The country hosted an official visit from President [[George W. Bush]] in [[2005]].       

Recently ([[2005]]) Saakashvili's government has become the object of criticism of several national and international human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]][http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/geo-summary-eng]. These have become increasingly concerned about the pressure on the judiciary by the procuracy and other government authorities. There also have been some concerns about the freedom of the media. Despite the impropriety of government actions in these areas, many Western commentators lauded the new government in its first stages. Evidence of effective reforms in the areas such as corruption, unemployment and pensions is however still awaited.

Following a crisis involving allegations of ballot fraud in the [[2003]] parliamentary elections, [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] resigned as president on [[November 23]], 2003 in the bloodless [[Rose Revolution]]. The interim president was the speaker of the outgoing parliament (whose replacement was annulled), [[Nino Burjanadze]]. On [[January 4]], [[2004]] [[Mikhail Saakashvili]], leader of the [[National Movement - Democrats]] (NMD) (former ''United National Movement'') won the country's presidential election and was inaugurated on [[January 25]].

Fresh parliamentary elections were held on [[March 28]] where NMD secured the vast majority of the seats (with ca. 75% of the votes) with only one other party reaching the 7% threshold (the [[Rightist Opposition]] with ca. 7.5%). The vote is believed to have been one of the freest ever held in independent Georgia although an upsurge of tension between the central government and the [[Ajaria|Ajarian]] leader [[Aslan Abashidze]] affected the elections in this region.

The tension between the Georgian government and that of Ajaria grew increasingly after the elections until late April. Climaxing on [[May 1]] when Abashidze responded to military maneuvers held by Georgia near the region with having the three bridges connecting Ajaria and the rest of Georgia over the [[Choloki River]] blown up. On [[May 5]], Abashidze was forced to flee Georgia as mass demonstrations in [[Batumi]] called for his resignation and [[Russia]] increased their pressure by deploying Security Council secretary [[Igor Ivanov]].

On [[February 3]] [[2005]], Prime Minister [[Zurab Zhvania]] allegedly died of [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning in an apparent gas leak at the home of [[Raul Usupov]], deputy governor of [[Kvemo Kartli]] region. Later, Zhvania's close friend and a long-time ally, Finance Minister [[Zurab Nogaideli]] has been appointed for the post by President Saakashvili.

==Origin of the name==
Georgians call themselves ''Kartvelebi'' (ქართველები), their land ''Sak'art'velo'' (საქართველო), and their language ''Kartuli'' (ქართული). These names are derived from a [[Paganism in Georgia|pagan chief]] called [[Kartlos]], said to be the father of all Georgians. The foreign name ''Georgia'', used in many languages of the world, is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] گرجی ''Gurji'' via the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Jurj''.  Because the spelling was influenced by the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''geōrg-'' (γεωργ-, indicating farming; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]), the word has been mistakenly supposed to have come from a [[cognate]] such as ''[[St. George]]'' (the country's patron saint), or ''γεωργία'' (''geōrgía'', farming).
[[Image:St George (15th cent, Georgia).jpg|thumb|Plaque portraying St George slaying the Dragon. 15th century cloisonné enamel on gold. 15X11,5 cm (National Art Museum of Georgia)]]

The ancient world knew the inhabitants of eastern Georgia as ''Iberians'', from the Caucasian kingdom of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] &mdash; thus confusing the geographers of antiquity, who thought this name applied only to the inhabitants of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Andorra]] and [[Gibraltar]]).

''Gorj'', the Persian designation for the Georgians, is also the source of Turkish ''Gürcü'' (pronounced "Gürdjü") and Russian ''Грузин'' ("Gruzin"). The name of the country is ''Gorjestan'' in Persian, ''Gürcistan'' in Turkish, "Gruziya" in Russian (''Грузия''), "Gruzya" (גרוזיה) or "Georgya" (גאורגיה) in Hebrew and whence 格魯吉亞 (pinyin: gélǔjíyà; cantonese: gaak3 lu3 gat1 a3) in Chinese and グルジア (''gurujia'') in Japanese. The Persian name is probably related to the [[wolf]] (''gorg''), the old cult of [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] peoples, hence ''Gorjestan'' - land of wolves.
The Armenian words for Georgian and Georgia, respectively ''Vir'' and ''Virq'' come from Iberia, with loss of the initial ''i-'' and substitution of ''w'' or ''v'' for the ''b'' of ''Iberia''.

There is also, in all likelihood, an etymological connection between the name [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] and the historic province of Georgia called [[Imereti]].

In the north, Georgia has a 723km common border with [[Russia]], specifically with the [[Northern Caucasus]] federal district. The following Russian republics/subdivisions - from west to east - border Georgia: [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Karachay-Cherkessia]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[North Ossetia-Alania]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Chechnya]], [[Dagestan]].  Georgia also shares borders with [[Azerbaijan]] (322 km.) to the south-east, [[Armenia]] (164 km.) to the south, and [[Turkey]] (252 km.) to the south-west.
[[Image:Prokudin-Gorskii-12.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Karolitskhali, a small river, with the Caucasus Mountains in the background, ca. [[1910]]]]
Mountains are the dominant geographic feature of Georgia. The [[Likhi Range]] divides the country into eastern and western halves. Historically, the western portion of Georgia was known as [[Colchis]] while the eastern plateau was called [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. Due to a complex geographic setting, mountains also isolate the northern region of [[Svaneti]] from the rest of Georgia.  

The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range separates Georgia from the [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] Republics of the [[Russian Federation]].  The southern portion of the country is bounded by the [[Caucasus Mountains|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]]. The main [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus Range]] is much higher in elevation than the [[Caucasus Mountains|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]], with the highest peaks rising more than 5,000 meters (16,400ft.) above sea level.  The highest mountain in Georgia is Mount [[Shkhara]] at 5,201 meters (17,059 feet), and the second highest is Mount [[Janga]] ([[Jangi-Tau]]) at 5,051 meters (16,572 feet) above sea level. Other prominent peaks include [[Kazbek|Kazbegi]] ([[Kazbek]]) at 5,047 meters (16,554 feet), Tetnuldi (4,974m./16,319ft.), Shota Rustaveli (4,960m./16,273ft.), Mt. [[Ushba]] (4,710m./15,453ft.), and Ailama (4,525m./14,842ft.).  Out of the abovementioned peaks, only [[Kazbek|Kazbegi]] is of [[volcanic]] origin. The region between [[Kazbek|Kazbegi]] and [[Shkhara]] (a distance of about 200 km. along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers. The [[Caucasus Mountains|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]] are made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of [[volcanic]] origin) that do not exceed 3,400 meters (approximately 11,000 feet).  Prominent features of the area include the [[Javakheti]] Volcanic Plateau, numerous lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs.

Major rivers in Georgia include the [[Rioni River|Rioni]] and the [[Mtkvari River|Mtkvari]].

===Landscape===
[[Image:Bazaleti.jpg|thumb|305px|The Farmlands of Eastern Georgia]]

The landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied.  Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and [[temperate rain forests]] to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi-arid plains characteristic of Central Asia.  Forests cover around 40% of Georgia's territory while the alpine/sub-alpine zone accounts for roughly around 10% of the land.

Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of Western Georgia has disappeared over the last 100 years due to the agricultural development of the land and urbanization.  The large majority of the forests that covered the [[Colchis]] plain are now virtually non-existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves (i.e. Paleostomi Lake area).  At present, the forest cover generally remains outside of the low-lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains.  Western Georgia's forests consist mainly of decidious trees below 600 meters (1,968 ft.) above sea level and comprise of species such as [[oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[Oriental Beech|beech]], [[elm]], [[ash tree|ash]], and [[Sweet Chestnut|chestnut]].  Evergreen species such as [[Buxus|box]] may also be found in many areas. There are significant concentrations of endemic species of plants as well. The west-central slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] in [[Ajaria]] as well as several regions in [[Samegrelo]] and [[Abkhazia]] are covered by [[temperate rain forests]]. Between 600-1,500 meters (1,968-4,920 ft.) above sea level, the decidious forest becomes mixed with both broad-leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life.  The zone is made up mainly of beech, [[Caucasian Spruce|spruce]], and [[Nordmann Fir|fir]] forests.  From 1,500-1,800 meters (4,920-5,904 ft.), the forest becomes largely coniferous.  The tree line generally ends at around 1,800 meters (5,904 ft.) and the [[alpine]] zone takes over, which in most areas, extends up to an elevation of 3,000 meters (9,840 ft.) above sea level.  The eternal snow and [[glacier]] zone lies above the 3,000 meter line.

[[Image:Svaneti Kavkasioni.jpg|thumb|305px|View of the Caucasus Mountains in [[Svaneti]]]]

Eastern Georgia's landscape (referring to the territory east of the [[Likhi]] Range) is considerably different from that of the west. Although, much like the [[Colchis]] plain in the west, nearly all of the low-lying areas of eastern Georgia including the [[Mtkvari]] and [[Alazani]] River plains have been deforested for agricultural purposes. In addition, due to the region's relatively drier climate, some of the low-lying plains (especially in [[Kartli]] and south-eastern [[Kakheti]]) were never covered by forests in the first place.  The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains.  In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85% of the forests of the region are deciduous.  Coniferous forests only dominate in the [[Borjomi Gorge]] and in the extreme western areas.  Out of the deciduous species of trees, [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[hornbeam]] dominate.  Other decidious species include several varieties of [[maple]], [[aspen]], ash, and [[hazelnut]].  In the upper [[Alazani]] River Valley, there are [[Taxus baccata|yew]] forests as well.  At higher elevations above 1,000 meters (3,280 ft.) above sea level (particularly in the [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], and [[Khevi]] regions), [[Scots Pine|pine]] and [[birch]] forests dominate. In general, the forests in eastern Georgia occur between 500-2,000 (1,640-6,560 ft.) meters above sea level, with the [[alpine]] zone extending from 2,000/2,200-3,000/3,500 meters (roughly about 6,560-11,480 ft.).  The only remaining large, low-land forests remain in the [[Alazani]] Valley of [[Kakheti]].  The eternal snow and [[glacier]] zone lies above the 3,500 metre (11,480 ft.) line in most areas of eastern Georgia.

==Climate==
The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size.  There are two main climatic zones, roughly separating Eastern and Western parts of the country.  The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north.  The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south as well.

Much of western Georgia lies within the humid subtropical zone with annual precipitation ranging from 1000-4000mm. (39-157 inches). The precipitation tends to be uniformly distributed throughout the year, although  the rainfall can be particularly heavy during the Autumn months. The climate of the region varies significantly with elevation and while much of the lowland areas of western Georgia are relatively warm throughout the year, the foothills and mountainous areas (including both the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains) experience cool, wet summers and snowy winters (snow cover often exceeds 2 meters in many regions).  [[Ajaria]] is the wettest region of the [[Caucasus]], where the Mt. Mtirala [[temperate rain forest|rainforest]], east of [[Kobuleti]] receives around 4100mm (161 inches) of precipitation per year.

Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental.  The region's weather patterns are influenced both by dry, Central Asian/Caspian air masses from the east and humid, Black Sea air masses from the west.  The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea is often blocked by several mountain ranges ([[Likhi]] and [[Meskheti]]) that separate the eastern and western parts of the nation.  Annual precipitation is considerably less than that of western Georgia and ranges from 400-1600mm. (16-63inches). The wettest periods generally occur during Spring and Autumn while Winter and the Summer months tend to be the driest.  Much of eastern Georgia experiences hot summers (especially in the low-lying areas) and relatively cold winters. As in the western parts of the nation, elevation plays an important role in eastern Georgia as well, and climatic conditions above 1500 meters (4920ft.) above sea level are considerably cooler (even colder) than those of the low-lyinig areas. The regions that lie above 2000 meters (6560ft.) above sea level frequently experience frost even during the summer months.

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|د جيورجيا اقتصاد}}

Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around [[Black Sea]] [[tourism]], cultivation of [[citrus fruit]]s, [[tea]] and [[grape]]s; mining of [[manganese]] and [[copper]]; and output of a small industrial sector producing [[wine]], metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs, including natural [[gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] products. Its only sizable internal energy resource is [[hydropower]]. Despite the severe damage the economy has suffered due to civil strife, Georgia, with the help of the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]], made substantial economic gains since [[1995]], increasing [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth and slashing inflation. The Georgian economy continues to experience large budget deficits due to a failure to collect tax revenues. Georgia also still suffers from energy shortages; it privatized the [[electricity distribution|distribution ]] network in 1998, and deliveries are steadily improving. Georgia is pinning its hopes for long-term recovery on the development of an international transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports of [[Poti|P'ot'i]] and [[Batumi]]. The growing trade deficit, continuing problems with [[tax evasion]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]], and political uncertainties cloud the short-term economic picture.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Georgia}}

Georgia's current population is 4,677,401 (July 2005 est.), with ethnic [[Georgians]] forming a majority of about 83.8%. [[Azerbaijanis]] form 6.5% of the population, [[Armenians]] 5.7% and [[Russians]] 1.5% (most Russians have emigrated since Georgia declared its independence). The [[Abkhazians]] in [[Abkhazia]] and the [[Ossetians]] in [[South Ossetia]] (and across the border in [[North Ossetia]]) have tried to secede from Georgia since independence. Two other [[Kartvelian]] groups live in Georgia: the [[Svan]] and the [[Mingrelians]], with smaller numbers of the [[Laz]] people, most of whom live in [[Turkey]]. They are linguistically different but closely related ethnically and culturally to other Georgians. There are numerous smaller groups in the country, including [[Assyrians]], [[Chechens]], [[Greeks]], [[Kabardins]], [[Kurds]], [[Jews]], [[Tatars]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Ukrainians]].

Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Georgia has suffered a serious population collapse as the rebellion in [[Abkhazia]], the strife in [[Ajaria]] and [[South Ossetia]], a fragile economy, and bad job opportunities led hundreds of thousands of Georgians to emigrate in search of work, especially to [[Russia]]. That problem is exacerbated by a very low birthrate among the remaining population. A similar problem exists in neighboring [[Armenia]]. The population is currently estimated to be a full million less than it was back in 1990, and some observers suggest the actual number is even lower. A side effect of this emigration is that the ethnic minority proportion of the population has roughly halved in the last fifteen years, as minority groups are more likely to leave the country.

== مذهب ==
Historical Georgian [[paganism]] was connected with [[Moon]] and the highest [[god]] in Georgian [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] was [[idolatry|idol]] of [[Armazi]], a figure of soldier, Moon-god, erected at the hill in Mtskheta. Other idols were [[Gatsi]], [[Gaime]] and [[Zadeni]].
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Sameba_Cathedral_in_Tbilisi.jpg|thumb|left|Newly built Sameba (Trinity) [[Cathedral]] in [[Tbilisi]] (1995-2004)]]  -->
At the place of [[Armazi]] idol now is built [[Jvari]] [[Monastery]]. The idols were destroyed in IV c. when Christianity became [[state religion]] of Georgia.
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Mosque_in_Tbilisi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mosque]] in [[Tbilisi]]]] -->
Today most of the population practice [[Orthodox Christianity]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] (83.9%). The religious [[minorities]] are: [[Islam|Muslim]] (9.9%); [[Armenian Apostolic]] (3.9%); Roman [[Catholic]] (0.8%). 0.8% of those recorded in the 2002 census declared themselves to be adherents of other religions and 0.7% declared no religion at all [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gg.html].
