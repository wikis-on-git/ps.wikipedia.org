'''حمدالله محب''' په ۱۹۸۳ز کال زېږېد یو افغان ډیپلومات دی چې د له ۲۰۱۵ز کال راهیسې د امریکې په متحده ایالاتو کې د افغانستان سفیر و.   هغه له دې دندې پرته ارجنټاین، ډومینیک جمهوریت، مکسیکو، او کولمبیا هېوادونو لپاره نامېشتي سفیر په توګه هم دنده ترسره کړه. 

As Ambassador, he has focused on highlighting the critical yet under-credited role of cultural and peace initiatives, women, and youth in re-creating Afghanistan. To this end, his priorities have been engaging with the Afghan diaspora across the United States; elevating the efforts of Afghan women toward social, political, and economic development; engaging with active US military and veterans who have served in Afghanistan; and implementing a comprehensive cultural and public diplomacy initiative within US schools, universities, and local organizations. 

In the summer of 2017, President Trump announced his administration’s policy for a renewed long-term engagement in Afghanistan, a result of months of intensive dialogue between Afghanistan and the United States. Moving forward, Ambassador Mohib will focus on nurturing investment partnerships between the United States and Afghanistan, as well as focusing on the shared security objectives of the two countries.

On August 25, 2018, Mohib was appointed Afghanistan's national security adviser replacing Mohammed Haneef Atmar in Afghan president [[Ashraf Ghani]]'s government.<ref name="NSA">{{cite news |last1=Associated Press |title=Afghan ambassador to US to replace national security adviser |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/official-suicide-bomber-eastern-afghanistan-kills-57428498 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |publisher=ABC News |date=25 August 2018}}</ref>
