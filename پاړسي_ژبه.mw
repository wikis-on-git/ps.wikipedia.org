'''Persian''' (known variously as: فارسی '''Fārsi''' or پارسی ''Pārsi'', local name in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], ''[[Tajik language|Tajik]]'', a [[Central Asia]]n dialect, or ''[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]]'', another local name in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]) is a language spoken in [[Iran]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], Southern [[Russia]], neighboring countries, and elsewhere. Prior to British colonization, Persian was also widely used as a second language in the [[Indian subcontinent]]; it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several Muslim courts in the subcontinent throughout the Middle Ages and became the official court language under the [[Mughal]] emperors. Evidence of its former rank in the region can still be seen by the extent of its influence on [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], as well as the popularity that [[Persian literature]] still enjoys in the region. Persian and its dialects have official-language status in the countries of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. According to [[CIA World Factbook]], there are 61 million native speakers of Persian in [[Iran]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html], [[Afghanistan]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html], [[Tajikistan]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ti.html] and [[Uzbekistan]] [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uz.html]. It belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, and is of the [[Subject Object Verb]] type. Since 200 million people speak in Persian throughout the world, UNESCO was asked to select Persian as one of its languages in 2006.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/tajikistan/story/2006/03/060310_so_conference_persian.shtml] 

==تاريخ==
Persian is a member of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, and within that family it belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch. Scholars believe the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] sub-branch consists of the following chronological linguistic path: Old Iranian ([[Avestan language|Avestan]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]) → Middle Iranian (Pahlavi [[Middle Persian]] and several other languages) → Modern Iranian (Persian, [[Pashto]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and several other languages), c. 900 to present.

[[Old Persian]], the main language of the [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions, should not be confused with the non-Indo-European [[Elamite language]] (see [[Behistun inscription]]). Over this period, the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language was simplified from the complex [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] and [[declension]] system of Old Persian to the almost completely regularized morphology and rigid [[syntax]] of Modern Persian, in a manner often described as paralleling the development of [[English language|English]]. Additionally, many words were introduced from neighboring languages, including [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] in earlier times, and later [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and to a lesser extent [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In more recent times, some Western European words have entered the language (notably from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]).

The language itself has greatly developed during the centuries. Due to technological developments, new words and idioms are created and enter into Persian like any other language. In [[Tehran]] the [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]] is a center that evaluates the new words in order to initiate and advise their Persian equivalents. In Afghanistan, the [[Academy of Sciences of Afghanistan]] does the same for Afghan Persian (among other languages).

==Nomenclature==
{{mergefrom|The announcement of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature}}
''Persian'', the more widely used name of the language in [[English language|English]], is an Anglicized form derived from [[Latin]] *''Persianus'' < Latin ''Persia'' < [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Persis'', a Hellenized form of Old Persian ''Parsa''. ''Farsi'' is the Arabicized form of Parsi, due to a lack of the /p/ phoneme in Standard Arabic. Native Persian speakers typically call it “Fārsi” in modern usage. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], the [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]], and many other sources call the language Persian. The government of Afghanistan uses both “Dari” and “Persian” in English communications.

The Academy of Persian Language and Literature as well as many lexicographers have announced that “Farsi” is not the appropriate term to use for the Persian language in English. In the [[ISO 639-1]], the local names form the basis for the language codes and for this reason “fa” is the designation for the Persian language in that system.

[[Image:Iranische_Sprachen.jpg|thumb|The region where Persian and other Iranian languages are spoken]]
Communication is generally mutually intelligible between Iranians, Tajiks, and Persian-speaking Afghans; however, by popular definition:
*[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] is the local name for the eastern dialect of Persian, one of the two official languages of [[Afghanistan]], including [[Hazaragi]] — spoken by the [[Hazara]] people of central Afghanistan.
*[[Tajik language|Tajik]] could also be considered an eastern dialect of Persian, but, unlike Iranian and Afghan Persian, it is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].

[[Ethnologue]] offers another classification for dialects of Persian language. According to this source, dialects of this language include the following:[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90035]
*'''Western Persian''' (in Iran)
*'''Eastern Persian''' (in Afghanistan)
*[[Tajik language|Tajik]] (in Tajikistan)
*[[Hazaragi]] (in Afghanistan)
*[[Aimaq]] (in Afghanistan)
*Bukharic (in Israel, Uzbekistan)
*Dehwari (in Pakistan)
*Darwazi (in Afghanistan)
*[[Dzhidi]] (in Israel)
*Pahlavani (in Afghanistan)

The following are some of the closely related languages of various Iranian peoples within modern Iran proper:
* [[Mazandarani]], spoken in northern Iran mainly in the province of [[Mazandaran]].
* [[Gileki language|Gileki]] (or ''Gilaki''), spoken in the province of [[Guilan]].
* [[Talysh]] (or ''Talishi''), spoken in northern Iran and southern parts of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].
* [[Luri language|Luri]] (or ''Lori''), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian province of [[Lorestan]] and [[Khuzestan]].
* [[Tat language|Tat]] (also ''Tati'' or ''Eshtehardi''), spoken in parts of the Iranian provinces of [[East Azarbaijan]], [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]] and [[Qazvin Province|Qazvin]].
* [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] or [[Gabri]], spoken originally in [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]] by the Zoroastrians of Iran. Also called [[Yazdi]] by some.

==Orthography==
[[Image:Dehkhoda note.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dehkhoda]]'s personal handwriting; a typical [[cursive]] Persian script.]]
The vast majority of modern Persian text is written in a form of the [[Arabic alphabet]]. In recent years the [[Latin alphabet]] has been used by some for technological or internationalization reasons. [[Tajik language|Tajik]], which is considered by many linguists to be a Persian dialect influenced by [[Russian language|Russian]], is written with the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] in [[Tajikistan]] (but not in Afghanistan).

===عربي ابېڅي===
{{main|Persian alphabet}}
{{mergeto|Persian alphabet}}
Modern Persian is normally written using a modified variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]].

====Script adoption====
After the conversion of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] to [[Islam]] (see [[Islamic conquest of Iran]]), it took approximately one hundred fifty years before Persians adopted the Arabic alphabet as a replacement for the older alphabet. Previously, two different alphabets were used for the Persian language (''[[Middle Persian]]'', or ''Pahlavi'', at that time): one was also called ''[[Pahlavi]]'' and was a modified version of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], and the other was a native Iranian alphabet called ''[[Dîndapirak]]'' (literally: religion script).

====Additions====
The Persian alphabet adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet, due to the fact that four sounds that exist in '''Persian''' do not exist in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as they come from completely separate language families. Some people call this modified alphabet the ''[[Perso-Arabic alphabet]]''. The additional four letters are:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: center"
| '''sound'''
| '''shape'''
| '''Unicode name'''
|-
| [p]
|style="font-size: larger"| پ
| Peh
|-
| {{IPA|[t&#643;]}} (ch)
|style="font-size: larger"| چ
| Tcheh
|-
| {{IPA|[&#658;]}} (zh)
|style="font-size: larger"| ژ
| Jeh
|-
| [g]
|style="font-size: larger"| گ
| Gaf
|}

====Variations====
Many Persian words with an Arabic root are spelled differently from the original Arabic word. ''Alef with hamza below'' (&nbsp;إ&nbsp;) always changes to ''alef'' (&nbsp;ا&nbsp;); ''teh marbuta'' (&nbsp;ة&nbsp;) usually, but not always, changes to ''teh'' (&nbsp;ت&nbsp;) or ''heh'' (&nbsp;ه&nbsp;); and words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that مسؤول becomes مسئول).

The letters different in shape are:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: center"
| '''sound'''
| '''original Arabic letter'''
| '''modified Persian letter'''
| '''name'''
|-
| [k]
|style="font-size: larger"| ك
|style="font-size: larger"| ک
| Kaf
|-
| [j] (y) and [i:], or rarely [ɑ:]
|style="font-size: larger"| ي or ى
|style="font-size: larger"| ی
| Yeh
|}

The diacritical marks used in the Arabic script, a.k.a. ''[[harakat]]'', are also used in Persian, although some of them have different pronunciations. For example, an Arabic ''[[Damma]]'' is pronounced /u/, while in Persian it is pronounced /o/.

The Persian variant also adds the notion of a pseudo-space to the Arabic script, called a [[Zero-width non-joiner]] (ZWNJ) by the [[Unicode Standard]]. It acts like a space in disconnecting two otherwise-joining adjacent letters, but does not have a visual width.

====Extensions to other languages====
The features of the Persian variant have been taken for other languages, such as [[Pushtu language|Pashto]] or [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and have sometimes been further extended with new letters or punctuation.

===Latin Alphabet===
The '''Universal Persian ([[UniPers]] / Pârsiye Jahâni) Alphabet''' is a Latin-based alphabet created over 50 years ago in Iran and popularized by Mohamed Keyvan, who used it in a number of Persian textbooks for foreigners and travellers. It sidesteps the difficulties of the traditional Arabic-based alphabet, with its multiple letter shapes and ambiguous spellings, and fits particularly well in contemporary electronically written media.

The "'''International Persian Alphabet'''" ([[IPA2]])[http://www.persiandirect.com/projects/ipa2/ipa2_tutor.htm], commonly called '''Pársik''', is another Latin-based alphabet developed in recent years mainly by A. Moslehi, a comparative linguist, as a project defined and maintained under the authority of [http://www.persiandirect.com/ Persian Linguistics Association]. It is claimed to be the most accurate and regular one among Latin-based Persian alphabets in which many linguistic aspects of Modern Persian have been observed; however, its rules are not as simple as that of UniPers.

'''[[Fingilish]]''', or '''Penglish''', is the name given to texts written in Persian using the [[Alphabets derived from the Latin#Basic Latin Alphabet|Basic Latin alphabet]]. It is most commonly used in [[online chat|chat]], [[email]]s and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] applications.

==Phonology==
:''Main article: [[Persian phonology]]''
The Persian language has six vowels and twenty-three consonants, including two affricates {{IPA|/ʧ/}} (ch) and {{IPA|/ʤ/}} (j).
Historically, Persian distinguished length: the long vowels {{IPA|/i:/}}, {{IPA|/u:/}}, {{IPA|/ɑ:/}} contrasting with the short vowels {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/æ/}} respectively. Modern spoken Persian, however, generally does not make this distinction anymore.

:''Main article: [[Persian grammar]]''

Suffixes predominate Persian morphology, though there are a small number of prefixes. Verbs can express tense and aspect, and they agree with the subject in person and number. There is no [[grammatical gender]] for nouns, nor are pronouns marked for [[natural gender]].

Normal declarative sentences are structured as “(S) (PP) (O) V”. This means sentences can be comprised of optional [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]], [[prepositional phrase]]s, and [[Object (grammar)|objects]], followed by a required [[verb]]. If the object is specific, then the object is followed by the word ''rɑ:'' and precedes prepositional phrases: “(S) (O + “rɑ:”) (PP) V” {{Harv|Mahootian|1997|p=6}}.

There are many [[loanword]]s in the Persian language, mostly coming from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and the [[Turkic languages]].

Persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially [[Indo-Iranian languages]] and [[Turkic languages]]. Many Persian words have also found their way into the English language. See [[List of English words of Persian origin]].
