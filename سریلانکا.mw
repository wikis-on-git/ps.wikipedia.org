'''Sri Lanka''', officially '''Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka''' (ශ්රී ලංකා  in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]/இலங்கை in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) (known as '''Ceylon''' before [[1972]]), is a [[tropic]]al [[island nation]] off the [[southeast]] coast of the [[Indian subcontinent]], about 31 [[kilometre]]s (18&frac12;&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) south of [[India]]. It is in a strategic position in the Indian Ocean, along major sea [[trade route]]s from the [[Far East]] to [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]. 

The country was a [[United Kingdom|British]] crown colony for more than a century, but gained independence [[February 4]], [[1948]] and is now a [[Democracy|Democratic]] [[Socialist state|Socialist Republic]] with a linguistically and religiously diverse population.

{{main|Names of Sri Lanka }}
In [[1972]], the official [[name]] of the [[nation]] that [[government|governs]] the [[island]] was changed to the [[Free]], [[Sovereignty|Sovereign]] and [[Independent (nation)|Independent]] [[Republic]] of Sri Lanka (ශ්රී ලංකා  in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]/[இலங்ைக in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]). In [[1978]] it was changed to the [[democratic socialism|Democratic Socialist]] Republic of Sri Lanka. Prior to [[1972]], Sri Lanka [[Geographical renaming|was known by a variety of names]]; ancient Greek geographers called it Taprobane, Arabs referred to it as Serendib, but the best known is Ceylon. Sri Lanka is translated as "sri" meaning "venerable" and "lanka" meaning "island".

{{main|History of Sri Lanka}}	
=== د تاريخ دمخه ===
{{main|Pre History of Sri Lanka}}
The earliest inhabitants of the island now known as Sri Lanka were probably the ancestors of the Veddas, an aboriginal people now numbering around 3,000 and living in remote mountain areas. [[Paleolithic]] human settlements have been discovered at excavations in several cave sites in the Western Plains region and the South-western face of the Central Hills region. Paleo-[[anthropology|anthropologists]] have shown that burial rites and certain decorative artifacts exhibit similarities between the first inhabitants of the island and the early inhabitants of [[south India|southern India]]. One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian epic [[Ramayana]]. The main written accounts of the country's history are the [[Buddhist]] chronicles of [[Mahavansa]] and [[Dipavansa]].

=== لرغونی تاريخ ===
{{SriLankaHistory}}According to legend, the history of the Sinhala people of the island begins with the arrival of an Indian prince named Vijaya and his followers. The story goes that when Vijaya arrived, there were people (referred to as [[Yaksha]]s in the scriptures) already living there. Vijaya took as his consort [[Kuveni]], the queen of these people, who gave birth to a son and daughter. This story is generally accepted to refer to the North Indian immigrants to a certain extent intermixing with the indigenous [[Vedda]] population. Later, however, Vijaya is said to have married a [[Pandya]]n princess from South India, from where he had more women brought as wives for his followers; this refers to early streams of immigrants from Southern India who peacefully integrated with the North Indian group. Vijaya's origins according to the [[Mahavamsa]] lie in the North-East of India (the region of what is now [[Orissa]]), while linguistic evidence in Sinhala clearly points to the North-West (the region of today's [[Sindh]] or [[Gujarat]]). Researchers believe that the term ''Sinhala'' and the national identity of the Sinhalese as one people developed only at a later stage, after non-Aryan immigrants and indigenous people had been absorbed into the population. 
{{Ancientcapitalsofsrilanka}}
[[Buddhism]] arrived from the Indian subcontinent in the [[3rd century BC]]. The [[Bhikkhu]] [[Mahinda]], said to have been a son or brother of Buddhist Indian Emperor [[Ashoka]], was sent to Sri Lanka as a missionary; he is said to have converted the Sinhalese King Devanampiyatissa at [[Mihintale]]. The Sinhalese population at large subsequently became Buddhists.

The country's written history is almost exclusively Sinhalese-Buddhist, but since the earliest times the presence of Tamil-speaking people in the island is mentioned in the chronicles. There is no clearly established date for the arrival of [[Dravidian]] people on the island, which is thought to have occurred soon after that group reached [[South India]]. While there is no mention of wars between the Sinhalese and Tamils of Sri Lanka, there are many reports of conflicts between the Sinhalese and South Indian kingdoms which invaded Sri Lanka on several occasions because of the prosperity of the country; parts of the island, especially areas close to India, were ruled at times by Dravidian dynasties such as the [[Cholas]], [[Pandyas]], [[Cheras]] and [[Pallavas]]. The island was also invaded and ruled by Kings of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] and [[Malay Peninsula|Malay]] Straits. Several times, South Indian kings were expelled from the island by Sinhalese rulers from the South; the most famous story is that of the victory of the Sinhalese prince [[Dutugemunu]] over the Tamil king [[Elara]] of Anuradhapura in 161 B.C.E. Over the centuries, several Sinhalese kingdoms with different capitals existed, often simultaneously. At least by the 13th century B.C.E., a Tamil kingdom with the capital [[Jaffna]] had been established in the North, but it did not last long. 

[[دوتنه:Vijay_landing.jpg|ښي|بټنوک|250px|Landing of King Vijaya depicted in a painting]] From the ancient period date some remarkable archaeological sites including the ruins of [[Sigiriya]], the so-called "Fortress in the Sky", and huge public works. Among the latter are large "tanks" or [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], important for conserving water in a climate that alternates rainy seasons with dry times, and elaborate [[aqueduct]]s, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile (1:60,000).

=== Colonial rule ===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:colombo_british.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Colombo Harbour in 1900s]] -->

In 1505 the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived on the island, and colonial rule began. At that point the island consisted of three [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] kingdoms, namely Yarlpanam (Anglicised [[Jaffna]]) in the north, [[Kandy]] in the central hills and [[Kotte]] at the Western coast. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] arrived in the 17th century. During Portuguese and Dutch rule of coastal areas, the interior, hilly region of the island remained independent, with its capital in [[Kandy]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] replaced the Dutch in [[1796]], and the coastal areas became a crown colony in [[1802]]. After the fall of the Kandy kingdom in [[1815]], the British unified it with the 'low country' Kingdoms on the island for administrative purposes in [[1818]]. A [[Sri Lanka Independence Struggle|struggle for independence]] started in the 1930s, when the [[Youth Leagues]] opposed the 'Ministers' Memorandum' which asked the colonial authority to increase the powers of the board of ministers, rather than moving toward independence.

=== خپلواکي ===
After the crucial role played by Ceylon in [[World War II]], the pressure for independence intensified, and 
under the name of Ceylon [http://www.glue.umd.edu/~pkd/sl/facts/name_origin.html], it became a [[dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] in [[1948]]. The first prime minister was [[Don Stephen Senanayake]]. In [[1972]], the country became a republic, and the name was changed to Sri Lanka.

{{main|Politics of Sri Lanka}}	 
	
{{Politics of Sri Lanka}}The [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] of the [[Republic]] is directly elected for a six-year term and serves as [[Head of State]], [[Head of Government]] and [[Commander in Chief]] of the armed forces. The President is responsible to Parliament for the exercise of duties in accordance with the [[Constitution]] and laws. The incumbent may be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of Parliament, with the agreement by the Supreme Court. The President appoints and heads a [[Cabinet]] of Ministers responsible to Parliament. The President's deputy is the [[prime minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]], who leads the ruling party in Parliament.

In post-independence Sri Lanka, a significant hallmark was the conflict between the socialist government headed by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the "capitalist" mainstream press. This conflict culminated in the take-over ("broadbasing") of the country's largest newspaper group through the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. (Special Provisions) Act 1973. 
	 
The Sri Lankan ''[[Parliament]]'' is a [[unicameral]] 225-member legislature. Members are elected by universal (adult) suffrage based on a modified [[proportional representation]] system by district to a six-year term. The primary modification is that the party that receives the largest number of valid votes in each constituency gains a unique "bonus seat" (''see'' Hickman, 1999). The president may summon, suspend, or end a legislative session and dissolve Parliament any time after it has served for one year. Parliament reserves the power to make all laws. Since its independence in 1948, Sri Lanka has remained a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Parliament was dissolved on [[February 7]], [[2004]] by President [[Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga]]. Elections were held on [[April 4]] and the new Parliament convened on [[April 23]] and elected Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.

In August [[2005]], the Supreme Court ruled that Presidential Elections would be held in November [[2005]], resolving a long-running dispute on the length of President Kumaratunga's term. [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] was nominated the SLFP candidate even though the party leader and President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did not support his campaign.  The former Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] was nominated the UNP candidate and had the backing of minority parties.

The Election was held on [[November 17]], [[2005]], and [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] was elected the fifth Executive President of Sri Lanka with a 50.29% of valid votes, compared to Ranil Wickremesinghe's 48.43%. [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] took oath as President on [[November 19]], [[2005]]. [[Ratnasiri Wickremanayake]] was appointed the 22nd Prime Minister on [[November 21]], [[2005]], to fill the post vacated by [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]]. He was previously Prime Minister in 2000. His narrow victory was largely due to the mass support from the Southern Sinhala-Buddhist voters. Also, in the North, the [[LTTE]] boycotted the election, thereby preventing thousands of Tamils living in the areas under their control from voting, and so Wickremasinghe, whose election promises included a [[Federal republic|Federal]] state to the North and East, from taking power.

Rajapaksa offers less autonomy than Wickremasinghe to the [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|northeast]], home to most of Sri Lanka's 3.2 million ethnic [[Tamil people|Tamils]]. However, since taking the office, Rajapaksa has offered to have peace talks with the LTTE on a permanent solution to the conflict.

{{main|Foreign relations of Sri Lanka}}

Sri Lanka generally follows a non-aligned foreign policy but has been seeking closer relations with the United States since December 1977. It participates in multilateral diplomacy, particularly at the [[United Nations]], where it seeks to promote sovereignty, independence, and development in the developing world. Sri Lanka was a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM). It also is a member of the [[Commonwealth]], the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and the Colombo Plan. Sri Lanka continues its active participation in the NAM, while also stressing the importance it places on regionalism by playing a strong role in SAARC.

{{main|Military of Sri Lanka}}

[[دوتنه:para5.jpg|ښي|بټنوک|250px|Sri Lankan Army Airborne Commandos]]The [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Military]] comprises of [[Sri Lankan Army]], [[Sri Lankan Navy]] and [[Sri Lankan Air Force]]. They are under the control of the Ministry of Defence, which is currently controlled by President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] who also acts as Minster of Defence. The Sri Lankan Armed Forces are primarily focused on land warfare, with the Army being the oldest and largest of all the services. However, as the nation is surrounded by sea, the Navy is considered the most vital defence force. The Air Force is seen primarily as a support force for both land and naval services. The military has taken part in many wars throughout its history including the [[Boer Wars]] and both [[World Wars]] (under the command of the British at the time). Since independence, however, its primary missions have been [[counter-insurgency]], targeting armed groups within the country, most notably the [[LTTE]] and at one point the Sinhalese insurgent group the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]]. The Sri Lankan military has apparently received training assistance from other nations such as [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[United States]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and even [[South Africa]]. There have even been claims that soldiers from some of those countries have taken part in operations, but this has not been substantiated or confirmed. Recently, the Sri Lankan Army was chosen by the [[United Nations]] to take part in peacekeeping operations in [[Haiti]].

{{main|Geography of Sri Lanka}}

[[دوتنه:Ceylan-map.png|بټنوک|200px|ښي|Map of Sri Lanka]]
The island of Sri Lanka lies in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. It is separated from the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and the [[Palk Strait]].

According to [[Hindu mythology]], a land bridge to the Indian mainland, known as [[Rama's Bridge]], was constructed during the time of [[Rama]]. Often referred to as Adam's Bridge, it now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above [[sea level]]. According to temple records, this natural [[causeway]] was formerly complete, but was breached by a violent storm (probably a [[cyclone]]) in [[1480]].

The [[pear]]-shaped island consists mostly of flat-to-rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. Amongst these are [[Sri Pada]] and the highest point [[Pidurutalagala]] (also known as Mt Pedro), at 2,524 [[meter]]s (8,281&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The [[Mahaweli ganga]] (Mahaweli river) and other major rivers provide fresh water.

The [[climate]] is tropical, characterized by [[monsoon]]s: the northeast monsoon lasts from December to March, the southwest June to October. The lowest [[gravity|gravitational]] field on Earth lies just off the coast of Sri Lanka.

{{main|Ecology of Sri Lanka}}
[[دوتنه:Sinharaja09.jpg|بټنوک|ښي|Sinharaja Forest Reserve]] Sri Lanka is one of the world's [[bio-diversity]] hot-spots. Its [[forest]]s are among the most [[flora|floristically]] rich in Asia and for some [[fauna]]l groups, it has the world's highest density of species diversity. The southwest, where the influence of the moisture-bearing southwest monsoon is strongest, is home to the [[Sri Lanka lowland rain forests]]. At higher [[elevations]] they transfer to the [[Sri Lanka mountain rain forests]]. Both these [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]] [[ecoregions]] are very similar to those of India's [[Western Ghats]].

The north and east are considerably drier, lying in the [[rain shadow]] of the central highlands. The [[Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests]] are a [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forest]] ecoregion, which, like the neighbouring [[East Deccan dry evergreen forests]] of India's [[Coromandel Coast]], is characterized by [[evergreen]] trees, rather than the dry-season [[deciduous]] trees that predominate in most other tropical dry broadleaf forests.

These forests have been largely cleared for agriculture, timber or grazing, and many of the dry evergreen forests have been degraded to thorn scrub, [[Savanna|savannah]], or thickets. Several preserves have been established to protect some of Sri Lanka's remaining natural areas. The island has three [[biosphere reserve]]s, [[Hurulu Biosphere Reserve|Hurulu]] (established 1977), [[Sinharaja Biosphere Reserve|Sinharaja]] (established 1978), and [[Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya Biosphere Reserve|Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya]] (KDN) (established 2004).

Sri Lanka is a centre of [[bird]] [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]]. See [[Endemic Birds of the Indian Subcontinent]] for more information.

{{main|Economy of Sri Lanka}}

Sri Lanka is historically famous for the production of [[cinnamon]] and [[tea]] (introduced by the British in the 19th century). From independence until [[1977]], it had a strongly [[socialist]] economy, but since then it has been increasingly pursuing [[privatization]], market-oriented policies and export-oriented trade. While [[tea]] and [[rubber]] are still important, the most dynamic sectors are now food processing, [[textiles]] and apparel, food and beverages, [[telecommunications]], [[insurance]], and [[banking]]. By [[1996]], plantation crops made up only 20% of exports (compared with 93% in [[1970]]), while textiles and garments have reached 63%. 

The [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% during the early 1990s, until a drought and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth to 3.8% in [[1996]]. The economy rebounded in [[1997]]-[[2000]], with average growth of 5.3%. [[2001]] saw the first economic contraction in the country's history, as a result of power shortages, budgetary problems, the global slowdown, and [[Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka|continuing civil strife]]. Signs of recovery appeared after the 2002 ceasefire. The Colombo stock exchange reported the highest growth in the world for 2003, and today Sri Lanka has the highest [[per capita income]] in South Asia. {{Citation needed}}

In April 2004, there was a sharp reversal in economic policy after the government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe of the [[United National Party]] was defeated by a coalition made up of [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] and the left-nationalist [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] called the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]]. The new government stopped the privatization of [[state enterprise]]s and reforms of state [[utilities]] such as power and [[petroleum]], and embarked on a subsidy program called the Rata Perata economic program. Its main theme to support the rural and suburban SMEs and protect the domestic economy from external influences, such as oil prices, the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]].

But this policy of subsidizing imported commodities like fuel, [[fertilizer]] and [[wheat]] soon unravelled the fiscal sector. In 2004 alone Sri Lanka spent approximately [[US$]] 180 million on a fuel subsidy, as fixing fuel prices had been an election promise.

To finance the expanded [[budget deficit]] arising from a range of subsidies and a public sector recruitment drive, the government eventually had to print [[Rupee|Rs]] 65 billion (US$ 650 million) or around 3% of GDP. The expansionary fiscal policy, coupled with loose [[monetary policy]] eventually drove [[inflation]] up to 18% by January 2005, as measured by the Sri Lanka [[Consumer Price Index]].

By December 2004, the country was heading for a [[balance of payments]] crisis, as the currency depreciated and reserves dwindled. The tsunami in that month brought aid flows, and support from the IMF helped improve sentiment in the foreign exchange market. But GDP growth, which had climbed to 6.4% by the first quarter of 2004, had fallen to 4.8% by the first quarter of 2005. The tsunami helped stabilize the deterioration of macro-economic fundamentals as foreign debt relief and assistance from the International Monetary Fund strengthened both the external sector and fiscal operations.

A September 2005 IMF report called for an end to 'fiscal domination' of monetary policy and more independence for the Central Bank so that inflation could be contained.
In December 2005, Sri Lanka received its first international credit rating with [[Fitch Ratings]] assigning it a BB- (a rating held by Brazil and Indonesia among others).

Sri Lanka has the world's 53rd largest population. The Sri Lankan population has not been growing as quickly as many other [[Asian]] countries but has kept a steady pace for the last 20 years. The precise population is unclear because many people have been displaced as a result of the ethnic conflict and the tsunami. The population growth rate is 0.79% compared to 1.4% in [[India]] and 2.03% in [[Pakistan]]. Sri Lanka has a birth rate of 15.63 birth per 1,000 people and a death rate of 6.49 deaths per 1,000 people. Population density is greatest in the western part of the country, particularly around the largest city Colombo.

Ethnic identities in Sri Lanka generally do not represent the [[genetics|genetic]] heritage. [[Assimilation]] and intermixing has produced a group of people who are only marginally different from each other irrespective of ethnic boundaries. About 74% of Sri Lankans are [[Sinhalese]]. [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s constitute 18%, and though scattered evenly throughout the country, form a large proportion in the north, east and central provinces. Tamils comprise two communities: Native Tamils and immigrants from [[India]] (who arrived during the late colonial period) called “Indian Origin" (or "estate") Tamils. There is a large population of Moors ([[Muslims]] of Arab descent), living in all parts of the island, but forming a large percentage of the population living in the Eastern Province. There are smaller ethnic groups such as the [[Burgher people|Burghers]] (of mixed European descent) and [[Malay people]]. There is also a small population of the indigenous inhabitants of the island called [[Wanniyala-Aetto]] or ''Veddahs''. 

Both [[Sinhala]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] are official languages. [[English language|English]], the link language in the present constitution, is spoken competently by about 10% of the population, and is widely understood. All three languages are used in education, business and administration.

{{main|Culture of Sri Lanka|}}

The island is the home of two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese (centred in the ancient cities of Kandy and Anaradhapura) and the Tamil (centred in the city of Jaffna, where the public library that was destroyed in 1983 was the world centre of Tamil archives and scholarship). In more recent times a British colonial culture was added, and lately Sri Lanka, particularly in the urban areas, has experienced a dramatic makeover in the western mold. Until recently, for example, most Sri Lankans, certainly those in the villages, have eaten traditional food, engaged in traditional crafts and expressed themselves through traditional arts. But economic growth and intense economic competition in developed countries has spilled over even to much of Sri Lanka, producing changes that might variously be identified as progress, westernization, or a loss of identity and assimilation.

You can now find the presence of [[United States|American]] taste represented by [[McDonalds]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], and others. Sri Lankans have not stopped practicing their culture and traditions, but they have added western options to the customary diet such as [[Rice]] and Curry, Pittu (mixture of fresh rice meal, very lightly roasted and mixed with fresh grated coconut, then steamed in a bamboo mould). Kiribath (cooked in thick coconut cream for this un sweetened rice-pudding which is accompanied by a sharp chili relish called "Lunumiris"), Wattalapam (rich pudding of Malay origin made of coconut milk, jaggery, cashew nuts, eggs, and various spices including [[Cinnamon]] cloves and [[Nutmeg]] -- and most of all [[hopper (food)|hoppers]] ("appa"), batter cooked rapidly in a hot curved pan, accompanied by eggs, milk or savouries. Sri Lankan food also has Dutch and Portuguese influences, with the island's [[Burgher People]] community preserving this culture through traditional favourites such as Lamprais (rice cooked in stock and baked in a banana leaf), Breudher (Dutch Christmas cake) and Bolo Fiado (Portuguese-style layer cake). 

Being one of the largest producers of [[tea]] in the [[World]] ( the [[Royal Family]] of the [[United Kingdom]] has been known to drink [[Ceylon tea]]), [[Sri Lankans]] drink a lot of [[tea]]. Many [[Sri Lankans]] drink at least two cups a day.  

Religion plays an important part in the life and culture of Sri Lankans. The [[Buddhist]] majority observe Poya Days, once per month according to the [[Lunar calendar]]. The [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] also observe their own holidays.  There are many [[Buddhist]] temples in Sri Lanka and many [[mosques]], [[Hindu]] temples and [[churches]] all across the island. The North and the East of the island have many mosques and Hindu temples because a large [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Muslim]] population resides in those areas. Many churches can be found along the southern coast line because of a concentration of Christians, particularly [[Roman Catholic]]s, in that region. The interior of the island is mostly Buddhist, and indeed there are many Buddhists in all parts of the island. 

Sri Lanka's main sport is [[Cricket]]. Every child knows how to play cricket and there are many cricket fields scattered across the island for children and adults to play the sport. The biggest pastime of the Sri Lankan population other than playing cricket is watching the Sri Lankan National Team playing cricket. Most of the time, businesses shut down when there is a big match on television. This was the case in [[1996]] when the Sri Lanka team made (and won) the [[Cricket World Cup]] finals against Australia. The whole country shut down as if there was a curfew imposed.
