د محمد علي کلي ژوند او اسلام راوړلو په اړه لاندې کرښو ته نظر وکړئ.

== زوکړه او ماشومتوب ==
د محمد علي لومړنې نوم (كاسېس مارسلېس كلي ؤز دۍ د جنورۍ په ۱۸مه نيټۀ، كال ۱۹۴۲ز د امريكې په لازېل كمټكې نومي كلي كې وزېږېد. 
دده پلار كاسېس مارسلۍس كلي د لوحو رنګولو كاروبار كاوه. د مور نوم يې (اوډېسا كلي) ؤ، دده كورنۍ تورپوستې او د عيسوي دين د كاتوليك د ډلې لارويان ول. د نورو تورپوستو په انډول د كلي كورنۍ يوه درنه او ښه كورنۍ وه. د كلي پلار يو خوارېكښ انسان ؤ، نوځكه خو د تنګلاسۍ او غربت له ازمېښټ څڅه خوندي و. نو ځكه د محمد علي كلي ماشومتوب د نورو تورپوستو كوشنيانو په څېر له محرومۍ او ناچارۍ ښكار نه ؤ.

دده پلار يو عزت لرونكې سړۍ ؤ. د عام تورپوستي په څېر يې داسې كوم كار ندې كړې چې كله دې بندي كړاى شوې وي، ده له خپلو ماشومانو سره ډېره زياته مينه كوله، او دا يې غوښټل چې دده كوشنيان ښوونه ترلاسه كړي او د ټولنۍ يو معزز ښاري جوړ شي. 
كلي يې د همدې موخۍ لپاره په ښوونځي كې ورګډ كړ، لېكن د هغه چندانې زړه كړې ته زړه نه ښه كولو. دې د شوخ، چالاك او زيرك كوشنې ؤ. ملګرو سره جګړې كول، او هغوي په سوكانو وهل او ډارول دده د خوښۍ كار ؤ.
كله چې يې په جون ۱۹۶۰ز كې د مركزي لېسې ازموينه وركړه، نو په ډېرو لږو نمبرو بريالۍ شو. مګر له سوك وهلو سره يې له وړوكوالي څخه مينه وه. دده عمر دولس كاله ؤ، چې د متقاعد تورن جوزف مارټن نظر پرې هغه وخت ولږېد، كله چې ده د كوڅې ماشومان په ډېر جوش او جذبې وهل.

== د سوك وهنې نړۍ ته راتلل ==
جوزف مارټن كلي له ځان سره د سوك وهنې يو روزنځاى ته بوتلو، چېرې چې ده په ډېرې اريانتيا سره هغه هلكان وليدل، چې د سوكوهلو چلونه به ورښودل كېدل. 
كلي په دې كار كې دومره زړه ولږېد چې زياتره وخت به د غرمې ډوډۍ هم ورڅخه هېره وه. ده په ښه پاپندۍ او د زړه له تل نه د سوك وهنې روزنه ترلاسه كړه. عمر يې لا ۱۴ كاله نۀ ؤ، چې د لېسې د سوك وهنې په سياليو كې يې لومړې مقام ترلاسه كړ، كله چې يې د خپله ۱۸مه كليزه ولمانځله نو دده روزونكي ملګري جوزف مارټن داسې اعلان وكړ:
(ښاغليو! زموږ دې ځوان د ۷ كلو په لنډه موده كې په ۱۰۸سياليو كې ګډون وكړ، چې سل يې ګټلي او يواځې ۸ يې بايللي، چې دا ۸ سيالۍ هم د لومړني دور وې.)

له پوهنتون څخه په فارغېدو پورې د كلي نوم په ټوله امركا كې خپور شوې ؤ.

== ژوندليك ==
محمد علي كلي د كال ۱۹۴۲ز د جنورۍ په مياشت كې زېږېدلې. پلار يې (كلي) د لوحو جوړولو كار كاوه، مور يې (اوډېسه ګرېډي كلي) د كور كار كاوه. د كلي پلار يو مېتودېست (مسيحي ډله ده) ؤ، مګر خپله ښځه يې دې كار ته پرېښوده، چې خپل دواړه زامن د باپتيزم ډله كې وردننه كړي. ۱
ده به هره ورځ له ښوونځي څخه په رخصتېدو له خپلو ملګرو، لارويانو سره جګړې كولې. د ښوونځي سرښوونكي (اتووډ) به هر وخت دده څنګ نيوه، او خپلو زده كوونكيو ته به يې ويل، چې دا هلك به يو وخت له تاسو ټولو څخه زياتې پيسې وګټي. دده د بخت ستورې هغه وخت وځلېد، چې چا ترې سائيكل غلاكړ. نو دې مجبورا د پوليسو په ماموريت ورهۍ شو، او د خپل سائيكل په اړه يې د پوليس مامور ته وويل. كله چې د پوليسو مامور دده په ټنډه كې د يوه ښه راتلونكي اثرات وليدل، نو له ځان سره يې د سوك وهنې ځايي كلب ته بوتلو، او د سوك وهنې په روزنځاى كې يې ورداخل كړ. 

=== د لېوالتيا وختونه; د المپيک د سرو زرو مډال ===
Ali was first directed toward boxing by Louisville [[police officer]] [[Joe E. Martin]], who encountered the twelve year old Cassius Clay fuming over his bicycle being stolen.<ref>http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring05/Shaffer/clay.html</ref> 
However, without Martin knowing, he also began training with Fred Stoner at another gym. In this way, he could continue making 
$4 a week on ''Tomorrow's Champions,'' a TV show that Martin hosted, while benefiting from the coaching of the more-experienced Stoner, who continued working with Ali throughout his amateur career.

Ali's last amateur loss was to Kent Green of Chicago, who could say he was the last person to defeat the champion until Ali lost to Joe Frazier in 1971 as a pro. Under Stoner's guidance, Muhammad Ali went on to win six Kentucky [[Golden Gloves]] titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an [[Amateur Athletic Union]] National Title, and the [[Light Heavyweight]] gold medal in the [[1960 Olympics]] in [[Rome]].<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/spot/malitimeline1.html</ref> Ali's record was 100 wins, with five losses, when he ended his amateur career.

Ali states (in his 1975 autobiography) that he threw his [[Gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] into the [[Ohio River]] after being refused service at a 'whites-only' restaurant, and fighting with a white gang. Whether this is true is still debated, although he was given a replacement medal during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games.

=== پخوانی غښتلی وختونه ===
After his Olympic triumph, Ali returned to Louisville to begin his professional career. There, on [[October 29]], [[1960]], he won his first professional fight, a six-round decision over [[Tunney Hunsaker]], who was the police chief of [[Fayetteville, West Virginia]]. 

Standing tall, at 6-ft, 3-in (1.91 m), Ali had a highly unorthodox style for a heavyweight boxer. Rather than the normal style of carrying the hands high to defend the face, he instead relied on foot speed and quickness to avoid punches and carried his hands low. 

From 1960 to 1963, the young fighter amassed a record of 19-0, with 15 knockouts. He defeated boxers such as Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, Lamar Clark (who had won his previous 40 bouts by knockout), [[Doug Jones]] and [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]]. 
 
Ali built a reputation by correctly predicting the round in which he would "finish" several opponents, and by boasting before his triumphs. Ali admitted he adopted the latter practice from [["Georgeous George" Wagner]], a popular professional wrestling champion in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles area]] who drew thousands of fans. Often referred to as "the man you loved to hate," George could incite the crowd with a few heated remarks, and Ali followed suit. 

Among Ali's victims were [[Sonny Banks]] (who knocked him down during the bout), Alejandro Lavorante, and the aged [[Archie Moore]] (a boxing legend who had fought over 200 previous fights, and who had been Ali's trainer prior to [[Angelo Dundee]]). Ali had considered continuing using Moore as a trainer following the bout, but Moore had insisted that the cocky "Louisville Lip" perform training camp chores such as sweeping and dishwashing. He also considered having his idol, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], as a manager, but instead hired Dundee. 

Ali first met Dundee when the latter was in Louisville with light heavyweight champ [[Willie Pastrano]]. The teenaged Golden Glove winner traveled downtown to the fighter's hotel, called Dundee from the house phone, and was asked up to their room. He took advantage of the opportunity to query Dundee (who was working with, or had, champions [[Sugar Ramos]] and [[Carmen Basilio]]) about what his fighters ate, how long they slept, how much roadwork (jogging) they did, and how long they sparred. 

Following his bout with Moore, Ali won a disputed 10-round decision over Doug Jones in a matchup that was named "Fight of the Year" for 1963. Ali's next fight was against [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]], who knocked Ali down with a left hook near the end of the fourth round. The fight was stopped in the fifth due to a deep cut on Cooper's face.

Despite these close calls, Ali became the top contender for [[Sonny Liston]]'s title. Despite his impressive record, however, he was not widely expected to defeat the champ. The fight was scheduled for [[February 25]], [[1964]] in [[Miami, Florida]], but was nearly canceled when the promoter, Bill Faversham, heard that Ali had been seen around Miami and in other cities with the controversial [[Malcolm X]]. The Nation of Islam, considered a "hate group" by most media and Americans in 1964, was perceived as a gate-killer to a bout where, given Liston's overwhelming status as the favorite to win (7-1 odds<ref>http://www.saddoboxing.com/boxing-article/Sonny-Liston-v-Cassius-Clay.html</ref>), had Ali's colorful persona as its sole appeal. 

Faversham confronted Ali about his association with Malcolm X (who, at the time, was actually under suspension by the Nation as a result of controversial comments made in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination, which he called a case of "the chickens coming home to roost"). While stopping short of admitting he was a member of the Nation, Ali protested the suggested cancellation of the fight. As a compromise, Faversham asked the fighter to delay his announcement about his [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] until after the fight. The incident is described in the 1975 book "The Greatest: My Own Story" by Ali (with Richard Durham).

During the weigh-in on the day before the bout, the ever-boastful Ali, who frequently taunted Liston during the buildup by dubbing him "the big ugly bear" (among other things), declared that he would "float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," and, summarizing his strategy for avoiding Liston's assaults, said, "Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see."

=== نړیواله اتلولي او د اسلام منل ===
{{main|محمد علي د سني لټسن په مقابل کې}}

د جون میاشت ۱۹۶۳ز کال، کلي د برتانیې پر لور وخوځېد، او هورې یې هنري راوپرځاوه. له کوچنیوالي څخه دا د کلي تکیه کلام و (زه ستر یم) (i'm Great). ده چې به کله هم خپل سیا مات کړ، نو د هغه چارچاپېره به تاوېده او دا لنډه جمله به یې بیا، بیا ویله، په رښتیا هم چې محمد علي کلي څښتن تعالی لوړ مقام لیکلې ؤ، او کلي په نړیوالو خپل سترتوب ومانه.

د فبرورۍ په ۲۵مه، کال ۱۹۶۴ز کلي د فلورېډا په ښارکې د دران وزن نړیوال اتل سني لسټن ته ماتې ورکړه، او د لومړي ځل لپاره یې نړیواله اتلولي ترلاسه کړه. 
په همدې ورځ کلي د خپل ژوند له ټولو څخه سپېڅلې او انقلابي فیصله وکړه، ده په همدې ماښام د یو بل نوي مسلمان شوي امریکايي مېلکم اېکس سره يوځای په یو خبري غونډه کې ددې خبرې اعلان وکړ، چې دې مسلمان شوې. په همدې ورځ د تورپوستو مسلماننو د تنظیم مشر عالیجاه محمد په شکاګو کې دا اعلان وکړ، چې کاسېس کلي اسلام منلې او په نړیوالې اتلولې ګټلو کې له هغه سره څښتن عال

Ali (still known as Cassius Clay until after the bout), however, had a plan for the fight. Misreading Ali's exuberance as nervousness, Liston was typically over-confident and was unprepared for any result other than a quick knockout victory. In the opening rounds, Ali's speed kept him away from Liston's powerful head and body shots, as he used his height advantage to beat Liston to the punch with his own lightning-quick [[jab]].

By the third round, Ali was ahead on points and had opened a cut under Liston's eye. Liston regained some ground in the fourth, as Clay was blinded by a substance in his eyes. It is unconfirmed whether this was something used to close Liston's cuts, or deliberately applied to Liston's gloves for a nefarious purpose; however, [[Bert Randolph Sugar|Bert Sugar]] (author, boxing historian and insider) has recalled at least two other Liston fights in which a similar situation occurred, suggesting the possibility that the Liston corner deliberately attempted to cheat.

Whatever the case, Liston came into the fourth round aggressively looking to put away the challenger. As Ali struggled to recover his vision, he sought to escape Liston's offensive. He was able to keep out of range until his sweat and tears rinsed the substance from his eyes, responding with a flurry of combinations near the end of the fifth round. By the sixth, he was looking for a finish and dominated Liston. Then, Liston shocked the boxing world when he failed to answer the bell for the seventh round, later claiming a shoulder injury as the reason. Muhammad Ali indeed "Shook up the world!" as he had promised.

In the rematch, which was held in May 1965 in relatively-remote [[Lewiston, Maine]], Ali won by knockout in the first round as a result of what came to be called the "phantom punch." Many believe that Liston, possibly as a result of threats from Nation of Islam extremists, or in an attempt to "throw" the fight to pay off debts, just wanted to call it a day and waited to be counted out (see [[Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston]]). Others, however, discount both scenarios and insist that it was a quick, chopping Ali punch to the side of the head that legitimately felled Liston.

=== دين او مذهب ===
[[دوتنه:Elijah Muhammad and Cassius Clay NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Ali at an address by [[Elijah Muhammad]]]]
After winning the championship from Liston in 1964, Clay revealed that he was a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] (often called the [[Black Muslims]] at the time) and the Nation gave Clay the name Cassius X, discarding his surname as a symbol of his ancestors' enslavement, as had been done by other Nation members. On Friday, [[March 6]], [[1964]], [[Malcolm X]] took Clay on a [[Tour guide|guided tour]] of the [[United Nations]] building (for a second time). Malcolm X announced that Clay would be granted his "X." That same night, [[Elijah Muhammad]] recorded a statement over the phone to be played over the radio that Clay would be renamed [[Muhammad]] (one who is worthy of praise) [[Ali]] (fourth [[Rashidun|rightly guided caliph]]). Only a few journalists (most notably [[Howard Cosell]]) accepted it at that time. Venerable boxing announcer [[Don Dunphy]] addressed the champion by his adopted name, as did British reporters. The adoption of this name symbolized his new identity as a member of the [[Nation of Islam]]. 

Clay had discovered the Nation during a Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959, even writing a high school report on the organization. His school teachers at Louisville Central High were alarmed that a youngster with that much potential expressed interest in the nationalist faith. They dissuaded him from becoming involved. Many sportswriters of the early 1960s reported that it was Ali's brother, [[Rudy Clay]], who converted to Islam first (estimating the date as 1962). Others wrote that Clay had been seen at Muslim rallies two years before he fought Liston. Ali's own version is that he did buy a copy of the "Muhammad Speaks" newspaper from a Muslim in Chicago, and a 45 rpm record by Minister Louis X (later [[Louis Farrakhan|Farrakhan]]) called "[[A White Man's Heaven is a Black Man's Hell]]." 

Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam made him a lightning rod for controversy, turning the outspoken but popular former champion into one of that era's most recognizable and controversial figures. Appearing at rallies with [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] and declaring his allegiance to him at a time when mainstream America viewed them with suspicion — if not outright hostility — made Ali a target of outrage, as well as suspicion. Ali seemed at times to provoke such reactions, with viewpoints that wavered from support for [[civil rights]] to outright support of [[separatism]]. For example, Ali once stated, in relation to integration: "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don't want to live with the white man; that's all."<ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1072751,00.html</ref> And in relation to inter-racial marriage: "No intelligent black man or black woman in his or her right black mind wants white boys and white girls coming to their homes to marry their black sons and daughters."<ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1072751,00.html</ref> Indeed, Ali's [[Religion|religious beliefs]] at the time included the notion that the white man was "the devil" and that white people were not "righteous." Ali claimed that white people hated [[black people]].<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODMouHhdlok</ref>

Ali converted from the [[Nation of Islam]] sect to mainstream [[Sunni Islam]] in 1975. In a 2004 autobiography, written with daughter [[Hana Yasmeen Ali]], Muhammad Ali attributes his conversion to the shift toward Sunni Islam made by [[Warith Deen Muhammad|W.D. Muhammad]] after he gained control of the Nation of Islam upon the death of , [[Elijah Muhammad]], in 1975.

=== د ويتنام جګړه ===
In 1964, Ali failed the [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were sub par. However, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified 1A. He refused to serve in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] as a [[conscientious objector]], because "War is against the teachings of the [[Qur'an|Holy Qur'an]]. I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by [[Allah]] or The Messenger. We don't take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers." Ali also said in 1966: "I ain't got no quarrel with them [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] ... They never called me [[nigger]]."<ref>{{cite news |title="The Greatest" Is Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919377-5,00.html |pages=5 |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=1978-02-27 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=April 28, 1967 - Muhammad Ali - was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title for refusing to serve in U.S. military for religious reasons - This Week in Black History - Brief Article |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n26_v85/ai_15407999 |publisher=''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' |date=1994-05-02 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref>

From his rematch with Liston in May 1965, to his final defense against [[Zora Folley]] in March 1967, he successfully defended his title nine times, an active schedule for that period. Ali was scheduled to fight [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] champion [[Ernie Terrell]] in a unification bout in [[Toronto]] on [[March 29]], but Terrell backed out and Ali won a 15-round decision against substitute opponent [[George Chuvalo]]. He then went to England and defeated [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]] and [[Brian London]] by stoppage on cuts. Ali's next defense was against German southpaw [[Karl Mildenberger]], the first German to fight for the title since [[Max Schmeling]]. In one of the tougher fights of his life, Ali stopped his opponent in round 12. 

Ali returned to the United States in November 1966 to fight [[Cleveland Williams|Cleveland "Big Cat" Williams]] in the [[Houston Astrodome]]. A year and a half before the fight, Williams had been shot in the stomach at [[point-blank range]] by a Texas policeman. As a result, Williams went into the fight missing one kidney and 10 feet of his [[small intestine]], and with a shriveled left leg from nerve damage from the bullet. Ali beat Williams in three rounds. 

On [[February 6]], [[1967]], Ali returned to a [[Houston]] [[boxing ring]] to fight Terrell in what became one of the uglier fights in boxing. Terrell had angered Ali by calling him Clay, and the champion vowed to punish him for this insult. During the fight, Ali kept shouting at his opponent, "What's my name, [[Uncle Tom]] ... What's my name?" Terrell suffered 15 rounds of brutal punishment, losing 13 rounds on two judges' scorecards, but Ali did not knock him out. Analysts, including several who spoke to [[ESPN]] on the sports channel's "Ali Rap" special, speculated that the fight continued only because Ali wanted to thoroughly punish and humiliate Terrell. After the fight, [[Tex Maule]] wrote, "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty."

Appearing for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces on [[April 28]], [[1967]] in Houston, he refused three times to step forward at the call of his name. An officer warned him he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more Ali refused to budge when his name was called.

That day, the [[New York|New York State]] [[Athletic commission|Athletic Commission]] suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit.

At the trial two months later, the jury, after only 21 minutes of deliberation, found Ali guilty. The judge imposed the maximum sentence. After a [[Court of Appeals|court of appeals]] upheld the conviction, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. During this time, people turned against the war, and support for Ali grew. Ali financially supported himself by opening a restaurant chain called "Champburger" and visiting many college universities to give speeches across the country. [[Joe Frazier]], who had become champion during Ali's absence from the ring, often gave financial assistance to Ali during this time.

=== د پېړۍ جګړه ===
{{main|د پيړۍ جګړه}}

In 1970, Ali was allowed to fight again. With the help of a [[State Senator|state senator]], he was granted a license to box in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] because it was the only state in America without a boxing commission. In October 1970, he stopped [[Jerry Quarry]] on a cut after three rounds. Shortly after the Quarry fight, the [[New York State Supreme Court]] ruled that Ali had been unjustly denied a boxing license. Once again able to fight in New York, he fought [[Oscar Bonavena]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in December 1970. After a tough 14 rounds, Ali stopped Bonavena in the 15th, paving the way for a title fight against [[Joe Frazier]], who had acquired the title during Ali's absence and was himself undefeated.

Ali and Frazier met in the ring on [[March 8]], [[1971]], at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The fight, known as '"The [[Fight of the Century]]," was one of the most eagerly anticipated bouts of all time and remains one of the most famous. It featured two skilled, undefeated fighters, both of whom had legitimate claims to the heavyweight crown. The fight lived up to the hype, and Frazier punctuated his victory by flooring Ali with a hard left hook in the 15th and final round. [[Frank Sinatra]] — unable to acquire a ringside seat — took photos of the match for [[Life Magazine]]. Legendary boxing announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and actor and boxing aficionado [[Burt Lancaster]] called the action for the broadcast, which reached millions of people.

Frazier retained the title on a unanimous decision, dealing Ali his first professional loss. However, Ali won a more important victory on [[June 28]], [[1971]], when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reversed his conviction for refusing induction by unanimous decision in [[Clay v. United States]]. 

In 1973, after a string of victories over top heavyweight opposition in a campaign to force a rematch with Frazier, Ali split two bouts with [[Ken Norton]] (in the bout that Ali lost to Norton, Ali suffered a broken jaw), before beating Frazier (who had lost the title to George Foreman) on points in their [[Ali-Frazier II|1974 rematch]], to earn another title shot -- but this time against a seemingly-invincible Foreman.

=== ''The Rumble in the Jungle'' ===
{{main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}
Ali regained his title on [[October 30]], [[1974]] by defeating champion [[George Foreman]] in their bout in [[Kinshasa, Zaire]]. Hyped as "[[The Rumble In The Jungle]]," the fight was promoted by [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]. 

Almost no one, not even Ali's long-time supporter [[Howard Cosell]], gave the former champion a chance of winning. Analysts pointed out that [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Ken Norton]] had given Ali four tough battles in the ring and won two of them, while Foreman had knocked out both of them in the second round. 

During the bout, Ali employed an unexpected strategy. Leading up to the fight he had declared he was going to "dance" and use his speed to keep away from Foreman and outbox him. However, in the first round, Ali headed straight for the champion and began scoring with a right hand lead, clearly surprising Foreman. Ali caught Foreman nine times in the first round with this technique but failed to knock him out. He then decided to take advantage of the young champion's weakness: staying power. Foreman had won 37 of his 40 bouts by knockout, most within three rounds, with Foreman's eight previous bouts not going past the second round. Ali saw an opportunity to outlast Foreman, and capitalized on it. 

In the second round, the challenger retreated to the ropes inviting Foreman to hit him, while counterpunching and verbally taunting the younger man. Ali's plan was to enrage Foreman and absorb his best blows to exhaust him mentally and physically. While Foreman threw wide shots to Ali's body, Ali countered with stinging straight punches to Foreman's head. Foreman threw hundreds of punches in seven rounds, but with decreasing technique and effectiveness. Ali's tactic of leaning on the ropes, covering up, and absorbing body shots was later termed "[[Rope-a-dope|The Rope-A-Dope]]." 

By the end of the seventh round, Foreman was exhausted. In the eighth round, Ali dropped Foreman with a combination at center ring and Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, Ali had regained the title.  Foreman would become champ again at age 45, and Muhammad Ali, his best friend, however, did not attend the bout.  When asked why, he said "I would deviate attention from George.  It was his moment, not mine."  Many praised Ali for his thoughtfulness and respect towards Mr. Foreman.

The "Rumble in the Jungle" was the subject of a 1996 [[Academy Award]] winning [[documentary film]], ''[[When We Were Kings]]''. The match was ranked seventh in the [[British television]] program ''[[100 Greatest Sporting Moments|The 100 Greatest Sporting Moments]]''.

Ali would defend his title successfully from March 1975 (a bout against the "[[Bayonne Bleeder]]" [[Chuck Wepner]]) until his rematch with Leon Spinks in 1978. George Foreman would remain dormant for most of 1975 before resuming his career in 1976. Despite much publicity, a rematch between Ali and Foreman never materialized, and following a 1977 decision loss to [[Jimmy Young]], who did manage to knock him down, Foreman had a religious experience and subsequently stopped fighting without officially announcing a retirement. 

In March 1975, Ali faced [[Chuck Wepner]] in a bout that inspired the original [[Rocky]] movie. While it was largely thought that Ali would dominate, Wepner surprised everyone by not only knocking Ali down in the ninth round, but nearly going the distance. Ali eventually stopped Wepner in the fading minutes of the 15th round, but Wepner's display of courage and resilience gave [[Sylvester Stallone]], then an aspiring writer, actor and director, the basis of the plot for the first [[Rocky]] movie, which led to five sequels that have endured for 30 years. In May 1975, Ali faced [[Ron Lyle]], who lost by technical knockout in the 11th round after a barrage of punches by Ali. Two months later, in July 1975, Ali won a 15-round decision against [[Joe Bugner]] who was criticized by the press for resorting to defensive tactics rather than mounting an attack.

=== ''Thrilla in Manila'' ===
In October 1975, Ali fought Joe Frazier for the third time. The bout was promoted as the [[Thrilla in Manila]] by [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]], who had ascended to prominence following the Ali-Foreman fight. The anticipation was enormous for this final clash between two great heavyweights. Ali believed Frazier was "over the hill" by that point, and his overconfidence may have caused him to train less than he could have. Ali's frequent insults, slurs and demeaning poems increased the anticipation and excitement for the fight, but also enraged a determined Frazier. Regarding the fight Ali famously remarked, "It'll be a chilla, and a killa, and a thrilla, when I get the gorilla in Manila." 

The fight lasted 14 grueling rounds in temperatures approaching 100F. Ali won many of the early rounds, but Frazier staged a comeback in the middle rounds. By the late rounds, however, Ali had reasserted control and the fight was stopped when Frazier was unable to answer the bell for the 15th and final round (his eyes were swollen closed). Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to continue. Ali was quoted after the fight as saying "This must be what death feels like" and congratulated Frazier on his gutsy effort.

In early 1976, Ali would go on to face journeymen fighters such as [[Jean Pierre Coopman]] and [[Richard Dunn]] (Ali's last knockout of his career), winning easy decisions. In April 1976, an out-of-shape Ali out pointed the tough, young brawler [[Jimmy Young]], who had recently beaten [[George Foreman]] by decision and made Ali appear slow and immobile. 

Ali's next match after Dunn was a June 25th exhibition against the Japanese wrestler [[Antonio Inoki]].  <ref name=sweetScience>{{cite web | last = Tallent | first = Aaron | title=The Joke That Almost Ended Ali's Career|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/1716/joke-almost-ended-ali-career/| accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>Although widely perceived as a publicity stunt, the match would have a long-term detrimental affect on Ali's mobility.  Inoki spent much of the fight on the ground trying to damage Ali’s legs, while Ali spent most of the fight dodging the kicks or staying on the ropes.<ref name=inokiAli>{{cite web | title=Inoki vs. Ali Footage|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrXzH4WOUdc| accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>   At the end of 15 rounds, the bout was called a draw.  Ali's legs, however, were bleeding, leading to an infection.  He suffered two blood clots in his legs as well.<ref name=sweetScience/>

Nevertheless, in September, at [[Yankee Stadium]], Ali faced [[Ken Norton]] in their third fight, with Ali winning a close 15-round decision.  

In 1977, Ali faced only two opponents, defeating both by decision: the undistinguished [[Alfredo Evangelista]], who gave Ali another 15-round challenge, and the devastating puncher [[Earnie Shavers]], who nearly knocked him out in the second round. Shavers would be Ali's final successful defense of his heavyweight title. Following the fight, Ali's corner doctor, [[Ferdie Pacheco]], left Ali's entourage when it became clear to him that boxing was taking a significant toll on Ali, both physically and mentally. He made his decision when his warnings to Ali to retire went unheeded.

Olympic champion [[Leon Spinks]] finally dethroned Ali by decision in February 1978. The fight was criticized by many fans, since Spinks was a relative rookie with only seven professional bouts in his career. However, Ali reclaimed his title for an unprecedented third time in their September 1978 rematch and then retired at age 37. He returned, however, to face new champion [[Larry Holmes]] in 1980. Despite Ali's claim that Holmes would be "mine in nine" it soon became clear he had nothing left and was given a sound beating by Holmes. Angelo Dundee refused to let his man come out for the 11th round, in what became Ali's first and only loss by anything other than a decision. Ali's final fight, a loss by unanimous decision after 10 rounds, was to up-and-coming challenger [[Trevor Berbick]] in 1981.

=== Ali's legacy ===
[[دوتنه:AliOlympicTorch.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The torch Ali used to light the flame at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]]]
Muhammad Ali defeated almost every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. Ali was named "Fighter of the Year" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|Ring Magazine]]'' more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more ''Ring Magazine'' "Fight of the Year" bouts than any other fighter. He is an inductee into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] and holds wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He is also one of only three boxers to be named "[[Sportsman of the Year]]" by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. He is regarded as one of the best [[pound for pound]] boxers in history. He was a masterful self-promoter, and his psychological tactics before, during, and after fights became legendary. It was his athleticism and boxing skill, however, that enabled him to scale the heights and sustain his position for so many years.

In 1978, three years before Ali's permanent retirement, the [[Louisville Board of Aldermen|Board of Aldermen]] in his hometown of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] voted 6–5 to rename Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 [[Traffic sign|street signs]] were stolen. Earlier that year, a committee of the [[Jefferson County Public Schools]] considered renaming [[Central High School (Louisville)|Central High School]] in his honor, but the motion failed to pass. At any rate, in time, Muhammad Ali Boulevard—and Ali himself—came to be well accepted in his hometown.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Hill |title=Ali stirs conflicting emotions in hometown |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051119/ALI01/511190320 |publisher=''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' |date=2005-11-19 |accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>

He was the recipient of the 1997 [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]].

In 1982, Ali discovered he had [[Parkinson's disease]], a neurological syndrome characterized by tremors, rigidity of muscles and slowness of speech and movement, following which his motor functions began a slow decline. Although Ali's doctors disagreed about whether his symptoms were caused by boxing and whether or not his condition was degenerative, he was ultimately diagnosed with [[Pugilistic Parkinson's syndrome]].<ref name=vitapro>{{cite web| url=http://www.vitapro.com/Indonesia/ali1.htm | title =The World's Champion | author=William Plumber |date=1997-01-07| |publisher=www.people.com| accessmonthday =June 24 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> According to the documentary ''[[When We Were Kings]]'', when Ali was asked about whether he has any regrets about boxing due to his disability, he responded that if he didn't box he would still be a painter in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

[[دوتنه:Ali.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A recent photograph of Ali]]
Despite the disability, he remains a beloved and active [[public figure]]. Recently he was voted into [[Forbes]] Celebrity 100 coming in at number 13 behind [[Donald Trump]]. In 1985, he served as a guest referee at the inaugural [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]] event. In 1987 he was selected by the [[California]] Bicentennial Foundation for the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] to personify the vitality of the U.S. Constitution and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in various high profile activities. Ali rode on a float at the 1988 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]], launching the U.S. Constitution's 200th birthday commemoration. He also published an [[oral history]], ''[[Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times]]'' by Thomas Hauser, in 1991. Ali received a [[Spirit of America Award]] calling him the most recognized American in the world. In 1996, he had the honor of lighting the flame at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. 

[[دوتنه:AliCenter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Muhammad Ali Center]], alongside [[Interstate 64]] on [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]'s riverfront]]
He has appeared at the 1998 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] (Australian Football League) [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], where [[Anthony Pratt]] invited him to watch the game. He also greets runners at the start line of the [[Los Angeles Marathon]] every year.

In 1999, Ali received a special one-off award from the [[BBC]] at its annual [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] Award ceremony, namely the BBC Sports Personality of the Century Award in which he received more votes than the other four contenders combined. His daughter [[Laila Ali]] also became a boxer in 1999, despite her father's earlier comments against female boxing in 1978: "Women are not made to be hit in the breast, and face like that... the body's not made to be punched right here [patting his chest]. Get ''hit'' in the breast... ''hard''... and all that."

On [[September 13]], [[1999]], Ali was named "Kentucky Athlete of the Century" by the [[Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame]] in ceremonies at the [[Galt House|Galt House East]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Marc J. |last=Spears |title= Ali: The Greatest of 20th century; Show stops when the champ arrives for awards dinner |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/1999/9909/14/990914ali.html |publisher=''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' |date=1999-09-14 |accessdate=2007-01-07 }}</ref>

In 2001, a [[biographical film]], entitled ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'', was made, with [[Will Smith]] starring as Ali. The film received mixed reviews, with the positives generally attributed to the acting, as Smith and [[supporting actor]] [[Jon Voight]] earned [[Academy Award]] nominations. Prior to making the Ali movie, Will Smith had continually rejected the role of Ali until Muhammad Ali personally requested that he accept the role. According to Smith, the first thing Ali said about the subject to Smith was: "You ain't pretty enough to play me."

On [[November 17]], [[2002]], Mohammad Ali went to [[Afghanistan]] as "[[United Nations|U.N. Messenger of Peace]]". He was in [[Kabul]] for a three-day goodwill mission as a special guest of the [[United Nations]].<ref>[http://www.viewimages.com/Search.aspx?mid=1647010&epmid=1&partner=Google]</ref>

He received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] at a [[White House]] ceremony on [[November 9]], [[2005]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051103-5.html | title =Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients}author=William Plumber |date=2003-11-03| |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary - The Whitehouse| accessdate =June 24| accessyear =2006}}</ref> and the "[[Otto Hahn peace medal in Gold]]" of the [[United Nations]] Association of [[Germany]] (DGVN) in [[Berlin]] for his work with the US [[civil rights movement]] and the United Nations ([[December 17]], [[2005]]).

On [[November 19]], [[2005]] (Ali's 19th [[wedding anniversary]]), the $60 million non-profit [[Muhammad Ali Center]] opened in [[downtown Louisville]]. In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, [[social responsibility]], respect, and [[Personal development|personal growth]].

According to the Ali Center website, "Since he retired from boxing, Ali has devoted himself to humanitarian endeavors around the globe. He is a devout [[Sunni Muslim]], and travels the world over, lending his name and presence to hunger and poverty relief, supporting education efforts of all kinds, promoting adoption and encouraging people to respect and better understand one another. It is estimated that he has helped to provide more than 22 million meals to feed the hungry. Ali travels, on average, more than 200 days per year."

At the [[FedEx]] [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] on [[January 2]], [[2007]], Ali was an honorary captain for the [[Louisville Cardinals]] wearing their white jersey, number 19. Ali was accompanied by golf legend [[Arnold Palmer]], who was the honorary captain for the [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] [[Demon Deacon]]s, and [[Miami Heat]] star [[Dwyane Wade]].

A [[youth club]] in Ali's hometown and a species of [[rose]] (''Rosa ali'') have also been named after him. On [[June 5]], [[2007]], he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] of humanities at [[Princeton University]]'s 260th [[Graduation|graduation ceremony]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Ryan | first = Joe | title = Boxing legend Ali gets Princeton degree | publisher = [[Newark Star ledger]] | date = [[2007-06-05]] | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2007/06/boxing_legend_ali_gets_princet_1.html  | accessdate =  2007-06-05}}</ref>

As might be expected, there is no consensus among boxing experts and historians as to who is the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. ''[[The Ring (magazine)|Ring Magazine]]'', a prominent boxing magazine, named Muhammad Ali as number 1 in a 1998 ranking of greatest heavyweights from all eras. However, in a 1971 article [[Nat Fleischer]], the founder of the ''Ring'' who saw every heavyweight champion from [[Jim Jeffries]] to [[Joe Frazier]], refused to include Ali in his all-time top ten, saying: "''he does not qualify for rating with the greatest heavyweights of all time''".<ref>[http://www.thering-online.com/ringpages/boxinghistory.html#clayalltime CLAY AN ALL-TIME TOP 10?
DEFINITELY NO!]</ref> It should be noted though that Fleischer was writing after Ali's loss to Frazier, several years before his performance against Foreman and rematches with Frazier. Further, despite Ali having changed his name seven years previously Fleischer was still using the name Clay.

== شخصي ژوند ==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=November 2007}}
Muhammad Ali has been married four times and has seven daughters and two sons. Ali met his first wife, [[cocktail waitress]] Sonji Roi, approximately one month before they married on [[August 14]], [[1964]]. Roi's objections to certain [[Muslim]] customs in regard to dress for women contributed to the breakup of their marriage. They divorced on [[January 10]], [[1966]].  

On [[August 17]], [[1967]], Ali married 17-year old Belinda Boyd. After the wedding, she converted to [[Islam]] and changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: Maryum (b. 1968), Jamillah and Liban (b. 1970), and Muhammad Ali Jr. (b. 1972). 

However, Ali began an affair with a young woman named [[Veronica Porsche Ali|Veronica Porsche]] in 1975. By the summer of 1977, Ali's second marriage was over and he had married Veronica. At the time of their marriage, they had a baby girl, Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, [[Laila Ali|Laila]], was born in December of 1977. By 1986, Ali and Veronica were divorced.

On [[November 19]], [[1986]], Ali married Yolanda Ali. They had been friends since 1964 in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Their mothers were close friends, although Lonnie has publicly denied the popular notion that Muhammad Ali was once her babysitter. They have one adopted son, Asaad.  

Ali has two other daughters, Miya and Khaliah, from extramarital relationships.

''[[When We Were Kings]]'' is a 1996 [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary film about the "[[The Rumble in the Jungle|Rumble in the Jungle]]", Ali's legendary 1974 fight against [[George Foreman]] in [[Kinshasa]], Zaire (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]).

''Muhammad Ali: Made in Miami'' is a WLRN documentary which charts Cassius Clay's remarkable transformation from young boxing hopeful to cultural icon. The film traces Ali’s stunning rise through the heavyweight ranks, his friendship with Malcolm X, his historic clash with champion Sonny Liston, and his subsequent refusal to fight in Vietnam.

Ali has appeared as himself in numerous scripted films and television series, including the films ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''Body and Soul'' (1981 version, starring Leon Isaac Kennedy), and ''Doin' Time'' (1985); and the television series ''[[Vega$]]'' (1979), ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1979), and ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'' (1999). He also provided the voice for the [[Title role|titular character]] in the 1977 NBC [[List of animated television series|animated series]], ''[[I Am the Greatest: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali]]''.

Ali portrayed a former slave in [[Reconstruction]]-era [[Virginia]] who is elected to the [[United States Senate]] in the 1979 NBC TV movie ''Freedom Road'', which was based upon the 1944 novel by [[Howard Fast]].

Ali is featured prominently in a series of ESPN specials in honor of his 65th birthday. The shows include ''[[Ali Rap]]'', ''[[Ali's Dozen]]'' and ''[[Ali 65]]''. They premiered on December 9th, 2006 at 9PM EST on ESPN.

In 1969, Ali appeared with Pop Icon Andy Warhol in a short-lived television campaign for Braniff International Airways.  The commercial was not well-received by Braniff's customer base and was pulled from the airwaves in 1970.

In 1971, Ali appeared in a [[television commercial]] for [[Vitalis]] alongside fellow boxer [[Joe Frazier]], and he appeared in [[Super Bowl]] TV commercial for [[Pizza Hut]] with his real-life trainer [[Angelo Dundee]].

Sometime in the mid-1970s, Ali also appeared in a very amusing television ad for D-Con Roach Proof: after hitting a heavy bag (a training device suspended from above that simulates the bulk of an opponent for punching), he turns to the camera in his boxing gear, raises and shakes a fist, and exclaims to the audience, "I don' want you livin' wit' no roaches!"

=== وېډيويي لوبو كې ===
Ali has appeared in numerous video boxing games, some of which feature him as the title character. Examples include ''[[Foes of Ali]]'', ''[[Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing]]'', the ''[[Fight Night]]'' series and the game of ''[[Knockout Kings]]''

== شخصي ژوند ==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=November 2007}}
Muhammad Ali has been married four times and has seven daughters and two sons. Ali met his first wife, [[cocktail waitress]] Sonji Roi, approximately one month before they married on [[August 14]], [[1964]]. Roi's objections to certain [[Muslim]] customs in regard to dress for women contributed to the breakup of their marriage. They divorced on [[January 10]], [[1966]].  

On [[August 17]], [[1967]], Ali married 17-year old Belinda Boyd. After the wedding, she converted to [[Islam]] and changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: Maryum (b. 1968), Jamillah and Liban (b. 1970), and Muhammad Ali Jr. (b. 1972). 

However, Ali began an affair with a young woman named [[Veronica Porsche Ali|Veronica Porsche]] in 1975. By the summer of 1977, Ali's second marriage was over and he had married Veronica. At the time of their marriage, they had a baby girl, Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, [[Laila Ali|Laila]], was born in December of 1977. By 1986, Ali and Veronica were divorced.

On [[November 19]], [[1986]], Ali married Yolanda Ali. They had been friends since 1964 in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Their mothers were close friends, although Lonnie has publicly denied the popular notion that Muhammad Ali was once her babysitter. They have one adopted son, Asaad.  

Ali has two other daughters, Miya and Khaliah, from extramarital relationships.

As a world champion boxer and social activist, Ali has been the subject of numerous books, films and other creative works. He has appeared on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] magazine on 37 different occasions, second only to [[Michael Jordan]]. His autobiography ''The Greatest: My Own Story'', written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975. ''[[When We Were Kings]]'', a 1996 documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won an [[Academy Award]], and the 2001 biopic ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' garnered an Oscar nomination for [[Will Smith]]'s portrayal of the lead role.
