د کنېشکا واکمن په پیر کې د ګندهارا تمدن خپل لوړو پوړیو ته ورسېد. ګندهارا د بودیزم د دیني ښوونو منځۍ وګرځېد، او خلک به له لری، لری 
واټنونو څخه دې ځای ته د زده کړې لپاره راتللل پیل شول. یوناني، پارسي تمدنونو هم د ګندهارا په لرغوني تمدن باندې یو څه اغیز پرېښود. 
د ګندهارا بادشاهي له شپږمې مخزېږدې پېړۍ څخه نیولې تر ۱۱مې زېږدې 
پېړۍ پورې شتون درلود. لدې پیر څخه وروسته په ۱۰۲۱ زېږدې کې دا پراخه سیمه د افغان بادشاه سلطان محمود غزنوي تر ولکې لاندې راغله.  او لدې څخه وروسته د  ګندهارا نوم  مخ په ورکېدو شو.
د افغان واکمنو پر پیر کې به دا پراخه سیمه له کندهار، غزني، غور او بیا په وروستي وخت کې له کابل څخه اداره کېده. د مغولو په پیر کې دا سیمه د کابل د والي لخوا اداره کېده.

==جغرافیه==

افغانان د ویدي پیر څخه مخکې هم د کابل سیند (کوبا یا کابول) پر غاړه تر اباسینده پورې ودان ول. وروسته بیا د هندي پنجاب شمالي [[اترپردیېش]] ایالت ځینې برخې هم په ګندهارا کې ورګډې شوی، او پدې توګه ګندهارا د یو نړویال سوداګریزو چارو منځۍ وګرځېد. دا وخت ګندهارا د پارس او منځني اسیا ترمنځ د یو مهم اړیکتایي چېنل په توګه مخې ته راغې.

د ګندهارا بریدونه (سرحدونه) د وخت په تېرېدو سره ادلون بدلون موندلې. کله به د پېښور او ټېکسلا ښارونه به په ټولیز ډول د ګندهارا د ټاټوبي په نامه یادېدل، کله به د سوات دره (سانسکرېت سوَستُو) هم پدې ستر لرغوني مدنیت کې راشامله شوه.

The heart of Gandhara however was always the Peshawar valley. The kingdom was ruled from capitals at Pushkalavati (Charsadda), Taxila, Purushapura (Peshawar) and in its final days from Udabhandapura (Hund) on the Indus. According to the Puranas, they have been named{{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}} after Taksha and Pushkara, the two sons of [[Bharata]], a king  of [[Ayodhya]].

===مخ تاريخي پېر===
Evidence of Stone Age human inhabitants of Gandhara, including stone tools and burnt bones, was discovered at Sanghao near Mardan in area caves. The artifacts are approximately 15,000 years old. More recent excavations point to 30,000 years before present.

The region shows an influx of southern Central Asian culture in the [[Bronze Age]] with the [[Gandhara grave culture]] showing a continuum between the early neolithic culture of the region with close ties and relations with the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]]. This culture survived till 600 BC. Its evidence has been discovered in the Hilly regions of [[Lower Swat Valley|Swat]] and [[Panchkora Valley of Dir|Dir]], and even at Taxila.

The name of the [[Gandhāri]]s is attested in the [[Rigveda]] ([[RV 1]].120.1) and in ancient inscriptions dating back to Achaemenid Persia.  The Behistun inscription listing the 23 territories of King Darius I (519 BC) includes Gandāra along with Bactria and Thatagush (ϑataguš, Satagydia).  In the book "Histories" by Heroditus, Gandhara is named as a source of tax collections for King Darius. The Gandhāris, along with the Balhika (Bactrians), Mūjavants, [[Anga]]s, and the [[Magadha]]s, are also mentioned in the [[Atharvaveda]] (AV 5.22.14), as distant people. Gandharas are included in the [[Uttarapatha]] division of Puranic and Buddhistic traditions. The [[Aitareya Brahmana]] refers to king Naganajit of Gandhara who was contemporary of Janaka, king of Videha. 

Gandharas and their king figure prominently as strong allies of the [[Kuru]]s against the [[Pandava]]s in the [[Mahabharata]] war. The Gandharas were well trained in the art of war. According to [[Puranic]] traditions, this country (Janapada) was founded by ''Gandhāra'', son of Aruddha, a descendant of Yayāti. The princes of this country are said to have come from the line of Druhyu who was an (assumed) king of the Druhyu tribe of the Rigvedic period. According to Vayu Purana (II.36.107), the Gandharas were destroyed by Pramiti aka [[Kalika]], at the end of Kaliyuga.

The Gandhara kingdom sometimes also included [[Kashmir]]. Hecataeus of Miletus (549-468) refers to Kaspapyros (sometimes interpreted as referring to  Kashmira) as a [[Gandhara|Gandaric]] city. According to [[Gandhara Jataka]], (Jataka No 406), at one time, Gandhara formed a part of the kingdom of Kashmir. The Jataka also gives another name ''Chandahara'' for Gandhara. Buddhist texts like [[Anguttara Nikaya]] refer to sixteen great countries ([[Mahajanapadas]]) which flourished in the [[India]]n [[sub-continent]] during Buddha's time; only two of them, the Gandhara and the [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] were located in the [[Uttarapatha]] or the north-western division. 

Gandhāra is also thought to be the location of the mystical [[Lake Dhanakosha]], the birthplace of [[Padmasambhava]], the founder of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The [[Kagyu|bKa' brgyud (Kagyu)]] sect of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] identifies the lake with the Andan Dheri [[stupa]], located near the tiny village of Uchh near [[Chakdara]] in the lower [[Swat Valley]]. A spring was said to flow from the base of the stupa to form the lake. Archaeologists have found the stupa but no spring or lake can be identified.

===پشکلوتي او پرایاد===
The primary cities of Gandhara were Purushapura (now [[Peshawar]]), Takshashila or [[Taxila]]) and [[Pushkalavati]]. The latter remained the capital of Gandhara from the 6th century BC to the 2nd century AD, when the capital was moved to Peshawar. An important Buddhist shrine helped to make the city a centre of pilgrimage until the 7th century. Pushkalavati in the [[Peshawar]] Valley is situated at the confluence of the [[Swat River|Swat]] and [[Kabul River|Kabul]] rivers, where three different branches of the River Kabul meet. That specific place is still called Prang (from Prayāga) and considered sacred and where local people still bring their dead for burial. Similar geographical characteristics are found at site of Prang in Kashmir and at the confluence of the [[Ganges River|Ganga]] and [[Yamuna]], where the sacred city of [[Prayag]] is situated, west of  [[Varanasi|Benares]]. Prayāga (Allahabad) one of the ancient pilgrim centres of India as the two rivers are said to be joined here by the underground [[Sarasvati]] River, forming a triveṇī, a confluence of three rivers.

==د پارسيانو حکمراني==
[[Cyrus the Great]] (558-530 BC) built first the "universal" empire, stretching from Greece to the Indus River. Both Gandhara and Kamboja soon came under the rule of the [[Achaemenian]] [[Dynasty]] of [[Persia]] during the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]] or in the first year of [[Darius I]]. The Gandhara and Kamboja had constituted the seventh satrapies (upper Indus) of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. 

When the Achamenids took control of this kingdom, Pushkarasakti, a contemporary of king [[Bimbisara]] of [[Magadha]], was the king of Gandhara. He was enganged in a power struggle against the kingdoms of Avanti and Pandavas. 

The inscription on Darius' (521-486 BC) tomb at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]] near Persepolis records GADĀRA (Gandāra) along with HINDUSH (Hənduš, Sindh) in the list of satrapies.

Under the Persian rule, a  system of centralized administration with a bureaucratic system was introduced in the region. Influenced by the Persians and having access to Western Asian civilizations, great scholars such as [[Pāṇini|Panini]] and perhaps [[Kautilya]] lived in this cosmopolitan environment. The ''Kharosthi'' alphabet, derived from the one used for Aramaic (the official language of Achaemenids) developed here and remained national script of Gandhara until third century AD.

By about 380 BC Persian hold on the region weakened. Many small kingdoms sprang up in Gandhara. In 327 BC Alexander the Great conquered Gandhara and the Indian Satrapies of the Persian Empire. The expeditions of Alexander were recorded by his court historians and by Arrian (around AD 175) in his ''Anabasis'' and other chroniclers many centuries after the event. 

The companions of [[Alexander the Great]] did not record the names of Kamboja and Gandhara and rather, located a dozen small political units in their territories. Alexander conquered most of these political units of the former Gandhara, Sindhu and Kamboja Mahajanapadas. 

According to Greek chroniclers, at the time of Alexander's invasion, hyparchs Kubhesha, Hastin (Astes) and Ambhi (Omphes) were ruling lower Kabul valley, Puskalavati (modern Charasadda) and Taxila respectively, while Ashvajit (chief of Aspasios or Ashvayanas) and Assakenos (chief of Assakenois or Ashvakayanas) both being sub-units of the Kambojas) were ruling upper Kabul valley and Mazaga (Mashkavati) respectively.

Chandragupta, the founder of Mauryan dynasty is said to have lived in Taxila when Alexander captured this city. Here he supposedly met [[Kautilya]], who remained his chief adviser throughout his career. Supposedly using Gandhara as his base, Chandragupta led a rebellion against the Magadha Empire and ascended the throne at Pataliputra in 321 BC.  However, there are no contemporary Indian records of Chandragupta Maurya and almost all that is known is based on the diaries of Megasthenes, the ambassador of Seleucus at Pataliputra. Gandhara was acquired from the [[Hellenic Greece|Greeks]] by [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. 

After a battle with  [[Seleucus Nicator]] ([[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] successor in [[Asia]]) in 305 BC, the [[Mauryan]] [[Emperor]] extended his domains up to and including Southern [[Afghanistan]]. With the completion of the Empire's Grand Trunk Road, the region prospered as a center of trade. Gandhara remained a part of the Mauryan Empire for about a century and a half. 

Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta, was the one of the greatest Indian rulers. Like his grandfather, Ashoka also started his career from Gandhara as a governor. Later he supposedly became a Buddhist and promoted this religion in his empire. He built many stupas in Gandhara. Mauryan control over northwestern  frontier, including the [[Yona]]s, [[Kambojas]], and the Gandharas is attested from the Rock Edicts left by [[Ashoka]]. 
It is held by some scholars that the Gandharas and the [[Kambojas]] were one people.

The decline of the Empire left the [[sub-continent]] open to the inroads by the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]]s. Southern Afghanistan was absorbed by [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] in [[180 BC]]. Around about [[185 BC]], Demetrius invaded and conquered Gandhara and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Later, wars between different groups of Bactrian Greeks  resulted in the independence of Gandhara from Bactria and the formation of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]]. [[Menander I|Menander]] was its most famous king. He ruled from Taxila and later from [[Sagala]] (Sialkot). He rebuilt Taxila ([[Sirkap]]) and Pushkalavati. He became a Buddhist and is remembered in Buddhists records due to his discussions with a great Buddhist philosopher, Nāgasena, in the book ''[[Milinda Panha]]''.

Around the time of Menander’s death in 140 BC, the Central Asian Kushans overran Bactria and ended Greek rule there. Around 80 BC, the Sakas, diverted by their [[Parthia]]n cousins from Iran, moved into Gandhara and other parts of Pakistan and Western India. The most famous king of the Sakas, [[Maues]], established himself in Gandhara. 

By 90 BC the Parthians took control of eastern Iran and around 50 BC put an end to the last remnants of Greek rule in Afghanistan. By around 7 an  [[Indo-Parthian]] dynasty succeeded in taking control of Gandhara. The Parthians continued to support Greek artistic traditions. The start of the Gandharan [[Greco-Buddhist art]] is dated to c. 50-75 BC. Links between Rome and the Indo-Parthian kingdoms existed. There is archaeological evidence that building techniques were transmitted  between the two realms. Christian records claim that around AD 40 [[Thomas the Apostle]] visited India and encountered the Indo-Parthian king [[Gondophares]].<ref>Bracey, R 'Pilgrims Progress' [http://www.kushan.org/sources/thomasandapollonius.htm Brief Guide to Kushan History]</ref>

The Parthian dynasty fell about 75 to another group from Central Asia. The [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], known as [[Yuezhi|Yueh-Chih]] in China moved from Central Asia to [[Bactria]], where they stayed for a century. Around 75, one of their tribes, the Kushan (Kuṣāṇa), under the leadership of Kujula Kadphises gained control of Gandhara and other parts of what is now Pakistan. 

The Kushan period is considered the Golden Period of Gandhara. Peshawar Valley and Taxila are littered with ruins of stupas and monasteries of this period. Gandharan art flourished and produced some of the best pieces of Indian sculpture. Many monuments were created to commemorate the Jataka tales.

The Gandhara civilization peaked during the reign of the great Kushan king Kanishka (128-151). The cities of Taxila at Sirsukh and Peshawar were built. Peshawar became the capital of a great empire stretching from Bengal to Central Asia. Kanishka was a great patron of the Buddhist faith; Buddhism spread to Central Asia and the Far East across Bactria and Sogdia, where his empire met the Han Empire of China. Buddhist art spread from Gandhara to other parts of Asia. Under Kanishka, Gandhara became a holy land of Buddhism and attracted Chinese pilgrim to see monuments associated with many Jataka tales.
 
In Gandhara, Mahayana Buddhism flourished and Buddha was represented in human form. Under the Kushans new Buddhists stupas were built and old ones were enlarged. Huge statues of the Buddha were erected in monasteries and carved into the hillsides. Kanishka also built a great tower to a height of 400 feet at Peshawar. This tower was reported by [[Faxian|Fa-Hsien]], Sun-Yun and [[Xuanzang|Hsuan-Tsang]]. This structure was destroyed and rebuilt many times until it was finally destroyed by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in the 11th century. 

After Kanishka, the empire started losing territories in the east. In the west, Gandhara came under the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]], the successor state of the Parthians, and became their vassal from AD 241-450.

==ګندهارا د هونز د يرغل وروسته==
The Hepthalite Huns captured Gandhara around AD 450, and did not adopt Buddhism. During their rule, Hinduism was revived but the Gandharan Civilization declined. The Sassanids, aided by Turks from Central Asia, destroyed the Huns' power base in Central Asia, and Gandhara once again came under Persian suzerainty in AD 568. When the Sassanids were defeated by the Muslim Arabs in AD 644, Gandhara along with Kabul was ruled by Buddhist Turks. 

The travel records of many Chinese Buddhists pilgrims record that Gandhara was going through a transformation during these centuries. Buddhism was declining and Hinduism was rising. Fa-Hsien travelled around AD 400, when Prakrit was the language of the people and Buddhism was flourishing. 100 years later, when Sung-Yun visited in AD 520, a different picture was described: the area had been destroyed by Huns and was ruled by Lae-Lih who did not practice laws of the Buddha. Hsuan-Tsang visited India around AD 644 and found Buddhism on the wane in Gandhara and Hinduism in the ascendant. Gandhara was ruled by a king from Kabul, who respected Buddha's law, but Taxila was in ruins and Buddhist monasteries were deserted. Instead, Hindu temples were numerous and Hinduism was popular.

==ګندهارا د ترکانو او هندوانو د پاچاهۍ په وخت کې==
After the fall of the Sassanid Empire to the Arabs in 644, Afghanistan and Gandhara came under pressure from Muslims. But they failed to extend their empire to Gandhara. Gandhara was first ruled from Kabul and then from Udabhandapura (Hind).

In 665 Kabul was besieged by the Arabs who did not cross the Hindu Kush.  [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|The Arabs took Kabul]] They relinquished some of its control as Gandhara was ruled from Kabul by [[Shahi|Turkshahi]] for next 200 years. Sometime in the 9th century the [[Hindushahi]] replaced the Turkishahi. Based on various Muslim records the estimated date for this is 870. According to [[Al-Biruni]] (973-1048), Kallar, a Brahmin minister of the Turkshahi, founded the [[Shahi|Hindushahi]] dynasty in 843. The dynasty ruled from Kabul, later moved their capital to [[Udabhandapura]]. They built great temples all over their kingdoms. Some of these buildings are still in good condition in the Salt Range of the Punjab. 

===د ګندهارا پای ===
[[Jayapala]] was the last great king of this dynasty. His empire extended from west of Kabul to the river [[Sutlej]]. However, this expansion of Gandhara kingdom coincided with the rise of the powerful [[Ghaznavid Empire]] under [[Sabuktigin]]. Defeated twice by [[Sabuktigin]] and then by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in the Kabul valley, Jayapala committed suicide. [[Anandapala]], a son of Jayapala, moved his capital near Nandana in the Salt Range. In 1021 the last king of this dynasty, [[Trilocanapala]], was assassinated by his own troops which spelled the end of Gandhara. Subsequently, some Shahi princes moved to Kashmir and became active in local politics.

The city of [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan is said to have been named after Gandhara. According to H.W. Bellow, an emigrant from Gandhara in the fifth century brought this name to modern Kandahar. [[Faxian]] reported that the Buddha’s alms-bowl existed in Peshawar Valley when he visited around AD 400 (chapter XII). In 1872 Bellow saw this huge begging bowl (7 feet in diameter) preserved in the shrine of Sultan Wais outside Kandahar. When [[Olaf Caroe]] wrote his book in 1958 (Caroe, pp. 170-171), this relic was reported to be at Kabul Museum. The present status of this bowl unknown.

==د ګندهارا موندنه==
By the time Gandhara had been absorbed into the empire of Mahmud of Ghazni, Buddhist buildings were already in ruins and Gandhara art had been forgotten. After Al-Biruni, the Kashmiri writer Kalhaṇa wrote his book ''Rajatarangini'' in 1151. He recorded some events that took place in  Gandhara, and gave details about its last royal dynasty and capital Udabhandapura. 

In the 19th century, British soldiers and administrators started taking interest in the ancient history of the Indian Subcontinent. In the 1830s coins of the post-Ashoka period were discovered and in the same period Chinese travelogues were translated. [[Charles Masson]], [[James Prinsep]], and [[Alexander Cunningham]] deciphered the [[Kharosthi]] script in 1838. 
Chinese records provided locations and site plans of Buddhists shrines. Along with the discovery of coins, these records provided necessary clues to piece together the history of Gandhara. In 1848 Cunningham found Gandhara sculptures north of Peshawar. He also identified the site of [[Taxila]] in the 1860s. From then on a large number of Buddhist statues have been discovered in the Peshawar valley.

[[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] performed an excavation of Taxila from 1912 to 1934. He discovered separate Greek, Parthian, and Kushan cities and a large number of stupas and monasteries. These discoveries helped to piece together much more of the chronology of the history of Gandhara and its art.

After 1947 [[Ahmed Hassan Dani]] and the Archaeology Department at [[University of Peshawar]] made a number of discoveries in the [[Peshawar]] and [[Swat Valley]]. Excavation on many sites of the Gandhara Civilization are being done by researchers from Peshawar and several  universities around the world.

The [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]] are both the earliest [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist]] and [[India]]n manuscripts discovered so far. Most are written on birch bark and were found in labeled clay pots. [[Pāṇini|Panini]] has mentioned both the [[Vedas|Vedic]] form of Sanskrit as well as what seems to be  Gandhari, a later form (bhāṣā) of Sanskrit, in his [[Ashtadhyayi]]. 

Gandhara's language was a [[Prakrit]] or "Middle Indo-Aryan" dialect, usually called Gāndhārī. Texts are written right-to-left in the [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] script, which had been adapted for Indian languages from a Semitic alphabet, the [[Aramaic alphabet]]. Gandhāra was then controlled by the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] of the [[Persian empire]], which used the Aramaic  script to write the  Iranian languages of the Empire.

Semitic scripts were not used to write Indian languages again until the arrival of [[Islam]] and subsequent adoption of the Persian-style [[Arabic alphabet]] for New Indo-Aryan languages like [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Kashmiri]]. Kharosthi script died out about the 4th century. However, the [[Hindko]] and the archaic Dardic and  [[Kohistani]] dialects, derived from the local  Indo-Aryan [[Prakrit]]s,  are still spoken today. However, the Afghan language  [[Pashto]], is the most dominant language of the region today.

==ګندهاری ارټ==
Gandhāra is noted for the distinctive '''Gandhāra style''' of [[Buddhist art]], a consequence of merger of Greek, Syrian, Persian, and Indian art traditions. The development of this form of art started in Parthian Period (50 BC – AD 75). Gandhāran style flourished and achieved its peak during the [[Kushan]] period from 1st Century to 5th Century. It declined and suffered destruction after invasion of the [[White Huns]] in the 5th century.
