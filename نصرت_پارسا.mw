'''نصرت پارسا''' (د [[فبروري ۲۲]] [[۱۹۶۹]]&ndash;[[مۍ ۸]] [[۲۰۰۵]]) يو [[افغان]] سندرغاړی وه. هغه تر خپلې مړينې پورې د هېواد نه دباندې د آلمان په هامبورگ کې موسيقي غږوله او کله ناکله به يې په نورو هېوادونو کې په کنسرټونو کې هم برخه اخيسته.

== مخينه ==
نصرت پارسا د کابل ښار په يوې منځنۍ کورنۍ کې زېږېدلی و. د هغه کورنۍ د پخوا نه د موسيقي په چاپېريال کې تر يوې کچې پورې ښکېل وه او همدا سبب وه چې د ځوان نصرت هنري وړتيا وده وکړه او له ده نه يې يو بريالی سندرغاړی جوړ کړ.  According to Nasrat's personal account, he was first discovered after singing the songs of [[Ahmad Zahir]] on a national radio broadcast. After the singer heard the renditions of his songs by the 7 year old Nasrat, he got in touch with the child and invited him to sing with him.  Thus was Nasrat’s formal initiation into singing.

== هندوستان ته مهاجرت==
Due to [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]] and the ensuing disruptive guerrilla fighting, Nasrat Parsa and his family left Afghanistan in 1981 for [[Pakistan]] and subsequently to [[India]].  They took residence in the capital city of [[New Delhi]], a [[Refugees in India#Afghan refugees|popular destination]] for most Afghan war civilians.  There the 12 year old émigré was said to delve into studying music to find comfort from the negative psychological effects of the war.  He attended the school of music under the apprenticeship of classic Indian singer [[Daish Pandi]]. Although the [[Klasik|classical music of Afghanistan]] and [[Indian classical music]] differ considerably in tone and rhythm, the training nonetheless gave Nasrat a foundation to prepare his voice and gave encouragement to the amateur to pursue his interest professionally.  He also studied with [[Ustad Monawar Ali Khan]], a leading authority in certain [[Indian music]] styles who taught him details of musical instruments and notes.  He became one of the few Afghan singers who had a formal training in classical music. It was these lessons that would prepare him for performing the [[ghazals]] that he later became known for in [[Europe]].

After a few transition years in [[India]], Nasrat and his family immigrated to [[Germany]].  Establishing contact with other fellow countrymen in [[Hamburg]], Nasrat became more involved in the music scene with the other exiled Afghan singers and musicians.

From his initial involvements in private parties to the formal weddings where strong singing background is considered, Nasrat's name ranked high on the choice list.  At this time, he started working on recording professional albums as well.  His initial works met with moderate notability; however, they were commercially steady in success.

At weddings he was acclaimed for the warm welcoming of the bride and groom with his number ''[[Maa Destmal Aawordaim]]'' ('''ما دستمال آورديم ''') ('''Gohar''' Album) which roughly translates as “we‘ve brought our brother’s bride.”  This album established Nasrat as a respected singer and also garnered him praise of critics.  As a matter of fact, the monumentalizing of the bride and groom union following the entrance anthem of ''[[Ahesta Boro]]'' ('''آهسته برو''') in weddings with the hit song of the ''Gohar'' Album is now a strong tradition of Afghan weddings.

His performances hereon became regular, and he often teamed with other singers to perform in various cities outside of Germany.

== د ونکوور غميزه ==

In 2005, Nasrat Parsa was invited to perform at a concert in Vancouver on the occasion of [[Mother’s Day]], opening a comprehensive tour that was scheduled to include several cities in [[North America]].  At the height of his popularity, and on the occasion of promoting his upcoming album '''''Dil''''', the singer flew to [[Canada]] where he performed to a large crowd of fans, some of whom saw him live on stage for the first time.

Although the event itself went smoothly, the developments later on in the night was to etch a tragic mark.  Shortly after reaching his hotel room after the performance, Nasrat was approached by a group of young men claiming to be his fans.  There he was confronted by them about snubbing their request for singing fast songs that forced the drunken group to walk around idly instead of engaging them in festivity of dancing.  Although the singer maintained he was being respectful to the attending mothers who came to his concert on the occasion of Mother’s Day, one of the infuriated men-a 19 year old [[Ahmad Saier Froogh]]-dissatisfied with the justification, unexpectedly punched the singer in the face.  This caused him to slump in shock and lose his balance.  Since Nasrat had the disadvantage of position over the stairs, he fell, hitting his head on one of the concrete cases in a severe blow that had gained force with the momentum of the full fall.  Immediately unconscious, the singer didn't recover from his injuries.
 
On Sunday, [[May 8]] [[2005]] at 11:15pm (Pacific Time) Nasrat Ali Parsa, 36, was pronounced dead at a Vancouver hospital.

== د خښولو لمانځنې==
On [[May 12]] [[2005]], Nasrat Parsa’s body was flown back to Germany for burial.  The grief-stricken bereaved family members and fans around the world individually held services to honor the late singer.  Notably, the funeral held at [[Sayed Jamaladen Masjid]] by [[Habib Qaderi]] on [[May 15]], [[2005]] in Orange, USA, drew thousands of sorrowful fans.  Other cities, in the [[United States|USA]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[Afghanistan]] also held similar mourning sessions.

== Laguna Beach vigil ==

On [[May 13]] [[2005]], a candle light vigil was held in memory of the late singer in [[Laguna Beach]], [[United States|USA]].  The event, which drew many fans and sympathizers called for a conscious effort to respect all Afghan singers.  Furthermore, it called for active action against violence in future concert events to protect the other musical assets of Afghanistan.  The vigil was held with an [[Islamic]] theme to honor his family’s religious tradition. Similar ceremonies were also held thereafter in various cities around the world in honor of the singer.
