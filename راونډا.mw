'''Rwanda''' [[IPA|{{IPA|/ɾ(g)wɑndɑ/}}]], officially the '''Republic of Rwanda''', is a small [[landlocked]] country in the [[Great Lakes region (Africa)|Great Lakes region]] of east-central [[Africa]], with a population of approximately 8 million. It is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[برونډي]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[تانزانيه]].  Its fertile and hilly terrain, which gives it the title "Land of a Thousand Hills" ({{lang-fr|Pays des Mille Collines}} {{IPA|/ˈpe.dəˈmiː.koˈlæn/}}) ('''Igihugu cy'Imisozi Igihumbi''' in Kinyarwanda), supports the densest populations in continental Africa. It is best known to the outside world for the [[1994]] [[Rwandan genocide]] that resulted in the deaths of up to one million people.

High dependence on subsistence agriculture, high (and increasing) population density, decreasing soil fertility and uncertain climate make Rwanda a country where chronic malnutrion is widespread and poverty endemic. [http://www.wfp.org/country_brief/indexcountry.asp?country=646]
==History==
{{verify}}
{{main|History of Rwanda}}
As early as the 15th century there were two distinct groups of people, the Hutu, and the Tutsi living in Rwanda. The Tutsi, from further north, conquered the area, and became the ruling power, and forced the Hutu into a feudal type system that was strictly enforced. John Speke became the first European to visit Rwanda, and in 1895 the Rwandans accepted German rule to become part of German East Africa. The Germans, however, were at first completely dependent on the existing government; they did nothing to develop the country economically. The German authority kept the indigenous administration system by applying the same type of indirect rule established by the [[British Empire]] in the Ugandan kingdoms.  

After Germany's loss in [[World War I]], the protectorate was taken over by [[Belgium]] with a [[League of Nations mandate]]. Belgian rule in the region was far more direct and harsh than that of the Germans. However, the Belgian colonizers did realize the value of native rule.  Backed by Christian churches, the Belgians used the minority [[Tutsi]] upper class over lower classes of Tutsis and Hutus.  Belgian-forced labor policies and stringent taxes were mainly enforced by the Tutsi upper class, whom the Belgians used as buffers against people's anger, thus further polarising the Hutu and the Tutsi. Many young peasants, in order to escape tax harassment and hunger, migrated to neighboring countries. They moved mainly to Congo but also to Ugandan plantations, looking for work.

After [[World War II]] Rwanda became a [[United Nations|UN]] trust territory with Belgium as the administrative authority. Through a series of processes--including several reforms, the assassination of King [[Mutara III]] Charles in [[1959]] and the fleeing of the last Abega clan monarch, King [[Kigeli V]], to [[Uganda]]--the Hutu gained more and more power.  Upon Rwanda's independence in [[1962]], they virtually held it all.

Gregoire Kayibanda was the first president (1962 - 1973), followed by Juvenal Habyarimana (1973 - 1994). The latter, who many view as a ruthless dictator, was unable to find a solution to increasing social unrest, the calls for democracy and the long-running problem of Rwandan Tutsi refugees. Rwanda had by the 90s up to one million refugees scattered around neighbouring countries, the majority of them in Uganda and Burundi.

In [[1990]], the Tutsi-dominated [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) invaded Rwanda from Uganda. During the course of the fighting, top Rwandan government officials, mainly Hutu, began secretly training young men into informal armed bands called Interahamwe ("coming together"). Government officials also launched a radio station that began anti-Tutsi propaganda. The military government of [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] responded  to the RPF invasion with [[pogroms]] against Tutsis, whom it claimed were trying to re-enslave the Hutus. In August [[1993]] the government and the RPF signed a cease-fire agreement known as the [[Arusha accords]] in [[Arusha, Tanzania]] to form a power sharing government, but fighting between the two sides continued.  The United Nations sent a peacekeeping force named the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ([[UNAMIR]]), under the leadership of [[Canada|Canadian]] Lieutenant-General [[Roméo Dallaire]]. UNAMIR was vastly underfunded and under-staffed. More details of this aspect of the conflict are starkly explained in Dallaire's 2003 book ''[[Shake Hands With the Devil]]''. 

During the armed conflict, the RPF was blamed for the bombing of Kigali. These attacks were actually carried out by the Hutu army as part of a campaign to create a reason for a political crackdown and ethnic violence.  On April 6 [[1994]], President Habyarimana was assassinated [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/rwanda.htm] when his Falcon 50 trijet was shot down while landing in [[Kigali]]. It remains unclear who was responsible for the assassination &mdash;  most credible sources point to the Presidential Guard, spurred by Hutu nationalists fearful of losing power, although others believe that Tutsi rebels were responsible, possibly with the help of Belgian mercenaries. Over the next three months, the military and interahamwe militia groups killed between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates in the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. The RPF continued to advance on the capital, and occupied the northern, the east and the southern parts of the country by June. Thousands of civilians were killed in the conflict. U.N. member states refused to answer UNAMIR's requests for increased troops and money.  Meanwhile, [[France|French]] troops were dispatched to stabilize the situation under [[Opération Turquoise]], but this only resulted in an exacerbation of the situation, with the evacuation limited to foreign nationals. 

On July 4th, 1994, the war ended as the RPF entered the capital Kigali.  In the resulting [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]] over 2 million Hutus fled the country after the war, fearing Tutsi retribution. Most have since returned, although some Hutus remained in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], including some militia members that became involved in the [[First Congo War]] and [[Second Congo War]].  In 1996, after repeated unsuccessful appeals to the UN and the international community to deal with the security threat posed by the remnants of the defeated genocidal forces on its eastern border, Rwanda invaded eastern [[Zaire]] in an effort to eliminate the Interahamwe groups operating there. This action, and the simultaneous one by [[Uganda]]n troops, contributed to the outbreak of the [[First Congo War]] and the eventual fall of longtime dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]. 

Rwanda today is peaceful and showing signs of rapid development, but some Rwandans continue to struggle with the legacy of genocide and war. In 2004 a ceremony was held in Kigali to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the genocide, attended by many foreign dignitaries, and the country observes a national day of mourning each year on April 7.  Rwandan genocidal leaders are on trial at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], in the Rwandan National Court system, and, most recently, through the informal [[Gacaca]] village justice program.  The current Rwandan government, led by [[Paul Kagame]], has been praised by many for establishing security and promoting reconciliation and economic development, but is also criticised by some for being overly militant and opposed to dissent. The country now plays host to many international travelers and is regarded as a safe place for tourists.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Rwanda}}
After its military victory in July [[1994]], the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] organized a coalition government based on the 1993 Arusha accords, and political declarations by the parties. The National Movement for Democracy and Development--Habyarimana's party that instigated and implemented the genocidal ideology--along with the CDR--another Hutu extremist party--were banned, with most of its leaders either arrested or in exile.

A new Constitution was adopted by referendum and promulgated in 2003. The first post-war presidential and legislative elections were held in August and September 2003, respectively. The RPF led government has continued to promote reconciliation and unity amongst all Rwandans as enshrined in the new constitution - that forbids any political activity or discrimination based on race, ethnicity or religion.

In a survey conducted recently Rwanda tops the survey on Number of women in the Parliament with as many as 49 percent female representation.{{fact}}

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|Provinces of Rwanda|Districts of Rwanda}}
[[Image:Rw-map.png|thumb|Map of Rwanda]]

Rwanda is divided into five [[province]]s ({{lang|rw|''intara''}}) and subdivided into 30 [[district]]s ({{lang|rw|''akarere''}}).

The [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] include:

* [[North Province, Rwanda|North Province]]
* [[East Province, Rwanda|East Province]]
* [[South Province, Rwanda|South Province]]
* [[West Province, Rwanda|West Province]]
* [[Kigali Province, Rwanda|Kigali Province]]

Districts: see [[Districts of Rwanda]]

Prior to [[1 January]] [[2006]], Rwanda was composed of twelve provinces, but these were abolished in full and redrawn as part of a program of decentralization and reorganization.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Rwanda}}
{{MapLibrary|Rwanda_sat.png|Rwanda}}
[[Image:Nyungw.jpg|thumb|Nyungwe Forest]]
[[Image:Rwanda satellite map.png|thumb|Satellite image of Rwanda]]

This small country is located near the center of Africa, a few degrees south of the [[Equator]]. It is separated from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] by [[Lake Kivu]] and the [[Ruzizi River]] valley to the west; it is bounded on the north by [[Uganda]], to the east by [[Tanzania]], and to the south by [[Burundi]]. The capital, [[Kigali]], is located in the centre of the country.

Rwanda's countryside is covered by grasslands and small farms extending over rolling hills, with areas of rugged mountains that extend southeast from a chain of volcanoes in the northwest. The divide between the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Nile]] drainage systems extends from north to south through western Rwanda at an average elevation of almost 9,000 feet (2,740&nbsp;m). On the western slopes of this ridgeline, the land slopes abruptly toward Lake Kivu and the Ruzizi River valley, and constitutes part of the [[Great Rift Valley]]. The eastern slopes are more moderate, with rolling hills extending across central uplands at gradually reducing altitudes, to the plains, swamps, and lakes of the eastern border region. Therefore the country is also fondly known as "Land of a Thousand Hills" ({{lang|fr|''Pays des milles collines''}}). Recently, a British led exploration announced that they had located the longest headstream of the [[River Nile]] in [[Nyungwe Forest]][http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hampshire/4864782.stm].

==Climate==
Rwanda is a [[Tropics|tropical]] country; its high elevation makes the climate temperate. In the mountains, frost and snow are possible. The average daily temperature near Lake Kivu, at an altitude of 4,800 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (1,463&nbsp;m) is 73°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (23°[[Celsius|C]]). Rwanda is considered the lightning capital of the world, due to intense daily thunderstorms during the two rainy seasons (February&ndash;May and September&ndash;December). Annual rainfall averages 31 [[inch]]es (830&nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]]) but is generally heavier in the western and northwestern mountains than in the eastern savannas.

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Rwanda}}
[[Image:TaxiBusesKigali.jpg|thumb|325px|right|A row of minibus share taxis waiting to depart in Kigali]]

The transport system in Rwanda centres primarily around the road network, with paved roads between the capital, Kigali and most other major cities and towns in the country. Rwanda is also linked by road with other countries in [[East Africa]], via which the majority of the country's imports and exports are made. The country has an [[Kigali International Airport|international airport]] at Kigali, serving one domestic and several international destinations, and also has limited water transport between the port cities on Lake Kivu. A large amount of investment in the transport infrastructure has been made by the government since the 1994 genocide, with aid from the [[European Union]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and others.

The principal form of [[public transport]] in the country is the [[share taxi]], with express routes linking the major cities and local services serving most villages along the main roads of the country. [[Coach]] services are available to various destinations in neighbouring countries.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Rwanda}}

[[Image:Rwanda_francs.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rwanda notes currently in circulation]]

Rwanda is a rural country with about 90% of the population engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture. It is landlocked with few natural resources and minimal industry. Primary exports are [[coffee]] and [[tea]], with the addition in recent years of minerals (mainly [[Coltan]], used in manufacture of electronic and communication devices such as mobile phones) and flowers. Tourism also is a growing sector, notably around ecotourism (Nyungwe Forest, Lake Kivu)and the world famous and unique Moutain Gorillas in the Virunga park. It has a low gross national product (GNP), and it has been identified as a [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries|Heavily Indebted Poor Country]] (HIPC). In 2005, its economic performance and governance achievements prompted International Funding Institutions to cancel nearly all its debts.

According to the [[World Food Programme]], is estimated that 60% of the population live below the poverty line and 10-12% of the population suffer from food insecurity every year.[http://www.wfp.org/country_brief/indexcountry.asp?country=646]

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Rwanda}}

[[Image:Rwanda market cloth.jpg|frame|right|A Rwandan market]]
[[Image:Rwanda Road.jpg|thumb|right|The Road to Ruhengeri]]
All Rwandans speak Kinyarwanda and share the same culture and religions.  It is difficult to establish exactly what words like "[[Tutsi]]" and "[[Hutu]]" meant before the arrival of European colonists, because there was no written history.  Europeans greatly changed the meanings of those terms. In the 21st century a number of Rwandans reject the idea of sub-races and simply identify themselves as "Rwandans".
