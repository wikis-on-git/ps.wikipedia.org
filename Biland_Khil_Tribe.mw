The Biland Khel or Boland Khel, a small pocket of about 6.5 square kilometres, is part of this agency and is two kilometres off Thall, bordering North Waziristan and Kurram agencies. Responding to a long-standing demand of the Orakzais, the then President of Pakistan announced the creation of Orakzai Agency on 3 November 1973 and was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1973. Before it was upgraded to agency status, this area was administered as a Frontier Region of the Kohat district by the Deputy Commissioner of Kohat.
