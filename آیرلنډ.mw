The '''Republic of Ireland''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Poblacht na hÉireann'') is the official description of the sovereign state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]], off the coast of north-west [[Europe]]. The state's official name is '''Ireland''' (Irish: ''[[Éire]]''), and this is how international organisations and citizens of Ireland usually refer to the country. It is a member of the [[European Union]], has a [[developed country|developed economy]] and a population of slightly more than four million. The remaining sixth of the island of Ireland is known as [[Northern Ireland]] and is part of the [[برطانيه|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

''Main article: [[Names of the Irish state]]''

The constitution provides that the name of the state is "Éire, or, in the [[English language]], Ireland." However, the [[state]] is sometimes referred to as the "Republic of Ireland", in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland. The name ''Republic of Ireland'' came into use after the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] defined it as the official description of the state in [[1949]] (the purpose of the act being to declare that the state was a [[republic]] rather than a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]). It is also the accepted legal name of the state in the [[United Kingdom]] as per the [[Ireland Act 1949]]. Today, while ''Republic of Ireland'' is a valid term for the state, ''Ireland'' is used for official purposes such as treaties, government and legal documents, and membership of international organisations.

The state is also known by, in English, many other names, such as ''[[Éire]]'', ''The Free State'' and the ''Twenty-six Counties''. The use of Éire when speaking English in Ireland has become increasingly rare, not least due to historical condescending connotations.

The state has had more than one official title. The revolutionary state established by nationalists in [[1919]] was known as the "[[Irish Republic]]"; when the state achieved ''de jure'' independence in [[1922]], it became known as the "[[Irish Free State]]" (in the [[Irish language]] ''Saorstát Éireann''), a name that was retained until [[1937]].

==تاريخ==
''Main article: [[History of the Republic of Ireland]]''

The partition of Ireland came about because of complex constitutional developments in the early twentieth century.

From [[1 January]] [[1801]] until [[6 December]] [[1922]], Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Potato Famine]] in 1845-1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. 1 million Irish died of starvation, another 1.5 million were forced to emigrate, which set the emigration pattern for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From [[1874]], but particularly from [[1880]] under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] moved to prominence with its attempts to achieve [[Home Rule]], which would have given Ireland some autonomy without requiring it to leave the United Kingdom. It seemed possible in [[1911]] when the [[House of Lords]] lost their veto, and [[John Redmond]] secured the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]. The [[unionist]] movement, however, had been growing since [[1886]] among Irish [[Protestant]]s, fearing that they would face discrimination, and lose economic and social privileges if Irish [[Catholics]] were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of [[Ulster]], where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties. Under the leadership of the [[Dublin]]-born [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and the northerner [[James Craig|Sir James Craig]] they became more militant. In [[1914]], to avoid rebellion in Ulster, the British [[Prime Minister]] [[Herbert Asquith]], with agreement of the leadership of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] leadership, inserted a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area temporarily excluded. Though it received the [[Royal Assent]], the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]'s implementation was suspended until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons Redmond and his Irish [[National Volunteers]] supported the Allied cause, and tens of thousands joined the British Army.

In January [[1919]], after the December 1918 [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|general elections]], 73 of Ireland's 106 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] elected were [[Sinn Fein]] members who refused to take their seats in the [[British House of Commons]]. Instead they set up an extra-legal Irish parliament called [[Dáil Éireann]]. This Dáil in January [[1919]] issued a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] and proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]]. This Declaration of Independence was mainly a restatement of the 1916 Proclamation with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the [[United Kingdom]]. Despite this, the new [[Irish Republic]] remained unrecognised internationally except by [[Lenin]]'s [[Russian Republic]]. Nevertheless the Republic's [[Aireacht]] (ministry) sent a delegation under [[Ceann Comhairle]] [[Sean T. O'Kelly]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], but it was not admitted. After the bitterly fought [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]], representatives of the [[British government]] and the Irish rebels negotiated the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921 under which the British agreed to the establishment of an independent Irish State whereby the [[Irish Free State]] (in the [[Irish language]] ''Saorstát Éireann'') with [[dominion status]] was created. The [[Dáil]] narrowly ratified the treaty.

The Treaty was not entirely satisfactory to either side. It gave more concessions to the Irish than the British had intended to give but did not go far enough to satisfy republican aspirations. The new Irish Free State was in theory to cover the entire island, subject to the proviso that six counties in the northeast, termed "Northern Ireland" (which had been created as a separate entity under the ''[[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]'') could opt out and choose to remain part of the United Kingdom, which it duly did, to no-one's surprise. The remaining twenty-six counties became the [[Irish Free State]], a [[constitutional monarchy]] over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title [[monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]]). It had a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], a [[bicameral]] parliament, a cabinet called the "Executive Council" and a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]].

The [[Irish Civil War]] was the direct consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by [[Eamon de Valera]], objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty ''abolished'' the [[Irish Republic]] of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the "people have no right to do wrong". They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and that [[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dala]] would have to swear an oath of fidelity to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and his successors. Pro-Treaty forces, led by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], argued that the Treaty gave "not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it".

At the start of the war, the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an anti-treaty IRA. The pro-Treaty IRA became part of the new [[Irish Army|National Army]]. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty IRA, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Collins]] and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyites. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty Irregulars, and the determination of the government to overcome them, contributed significantly to their defeat.

The National Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4,000 people were killed altogether. As their forces retreated, the Irregulars showed a major talent for destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence.

[[Image:Irishpopulation.png|400px|left|Irish population through the [[20th century]].]]

On the [[29 December]] [[1937]] a new constitution, the [[Constitution of Ireland]], came into force. It replaced the Irish Free State by a new state called simply "Ireland". Though this state's ''constitutional'' structures provided for a [[President of Ireland]] instead of a king, it was not technically a republic. The principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of representing the state symbolically internationally remained vested in ''statute law'' in the King as an ''organ''. On [[1 April]] [[1949]] the Republic of Ireland Act declared a republic, with the functions previously given to the King given instead to the President of Ireland.

The Irish state had remained a member of the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] after independence until the declaration of a republic in April 1949. Under Commonwealth rules declaration of a republic automatically terminated membership of the association, consequently Ireland ceased to be a member.

The Republic of Ireland joined the [[United Nations]] in [[1955]] and the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in [[1973]]. Irish governments have sought the peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the [[British government]] in the violent conflict with the [[Provisional IRA]] in Northern Ireland known as the "[[The Troubles|Troubles]]". A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the [[Belfast Agreement]], was approved in [[1998]] in referenda north and south of the border, and is currently being implemented, albeit more slowly than many would like.

''Main article: [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland]]''

The state is a [[republic]], with a parliamentary system of government. The [[President of Ireland]], who serves as [[head of state]], is elected for a seven-year term and can be re-elected only once. The president is largely a [[figurehead]] but can still carry out certain [[constitution]]al powers and functions, aided by the [[Council of State]], an advisory body. The ''[[Taoiseach]]'' ([[prime minister]]), is appointed by the president on the nomination of parliament. The Taoiseach is normally the leader of the political party which wins the most seats in the national elections. It has become normal in the Republic for [[coalition]]s to form a government, and there has not been a single-party government since the period of [[1987]]–[[1989]].

The [[bicameral]] [[parliament]], the ''[[Oireachtas]]'', consists of a Senate, [[Seanad Éireann]], and a lower house, [[Dáil Éireann]]. The Seanad is composed of sixty members; eleven nominated by the Taoiseach, six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. The Dáil has 166 members, ''[[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]]'', elected to represent multi-seat constituencies under the system of [[proportional representation]] by means of the [[Single Transferable Vote]]. Under the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current statutory maximum term is every five years.
[[Image:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Leinster House]], the seat of [[Oireachtas Éireann]] (the Irish parliament)]]
The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members of the Government can be selected from the Senate, and the Taoiseach, ''[[Tánaiste]]'' (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance ''must'' be members of the Dáil. The current government consists of a coalition of two parties; [[Fianna Fáil]] under Taoiseach [[Bertie Ahern]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] under Tánaiste [[Mary Harney]].

The main opposition in the current Dáil consists of [[Fine Gael]] and [[Irish Labour Party|Labour]]. Smaller parties such as the [[Green Party/Comhaontas Glas|Green Party]], [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Socialist Party of Ireland|Socialist Party]] also have representation in the Dáil.

Ireland joined the [[European Union]] in 1973. Since then it has received 16% of all "first warnings" issued on environmental issues, despite being under 1% of the EU's population.

In 2004 Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the [[European Union]] .

As mentioned in the [[#Demographics|Demographics]] section, church attendance has declined rapidly in Ireland in recent years. As with other predominantly Roman Catholic European states (e.g., [[Italy]]), the Irish state has undergone a period of legal secularisation. In [[1972]], the "special position" of the Catholic Church in Ireland [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|was deleted from the Irish constitution]].

In 1995, after a seventy-year ban, a constitutional amendment allowed [[divorce]] in the Republic.

In [[1983]], the Irish constitution was amended to recognise "the right to life of the unborn", subject to qualifications concerning the "equal right to life" of the mother. In the 1990s the Supreme Court interpreted the qualifications in the amendment as allowing [[Abortion in Ireland|abortion]] in limited circumstances. However, the [[Oireachtas]] has not introduced a law enabling abortion to take place in those circumstances allowed by the court. A subsequent series of constitutional amendments allow Irish citizens access to information about abortion and to travel freely to get abortions outside Ireland.

The Catholic Church was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual abuse scandals and cover-up charges against its hierarchy. In 2005, a major inquiry was made into child sexual abuse allegations. The Fern's report, published on [[25 October]] [[2005]], revealed that more than 100 cases of child sexual abuse, between 1962 and 2002, by 21 priests, had taken place in the Diocese of Ferns alone. The report criticised the Garda and the health authorities, who failed to protect the children to the best of their abilities; and in the case of the Garda before 1988, no file was ever recorded on sexual abuse complaints.

==Counties==
''Main article: [[Counties of Ireland]]''

The Republic of Ireland has 26 [[county|counties]], and these are used in political, cultural and sporting contexts. [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] constituencies are required by statute to follow county boundaries, as far as possible. Hence counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies (e.g. Limerick East/West) and some constituencies consist of more than one county (e.g. Sligo-Leitrim), but by and large, the actual county boundaries are not crossed. As local government units, however, some have been restructured, with County Dublin distributed between three new county councils in the [[1990s]] and County Tipperary having been administratively two separate counties since the [[1890s]], giving a present-day total of 29 administrative counties and five cities. The five cities — Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford — are administered separately from the remainder of their respective counties. Five boroughs — Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford — have a level of autonomy within the county:

==Geography==
[[image:Ei-map.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Ireland]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Ireland]]''

The island of Ireland extends over 32,595 [[square mile]]s (84,421&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]]) of which 83% (or five-sixths) belong to the Republic (at 27,133&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi; 70,280&nbsp;km²), with the remainder constituting Northern Ireland. It is bound to the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the northeast by the [[North Channel (Great Britain)|North Channel]]. To the east is found the [[Irish Sea]] which reconnects to the ocean via the southwest with [[St George's Channel]] and the [[Celtic Sea]]. The west-coast of Ireland mostly consists of cliffs, hills and low mountains (the highest point being [[Carrauntoohill|Carrauntoohil]] at 1,041 m). In from the perimeter of the country is mostly relatively flat farmland, traversed by rivers such as the [[River Shannon]] and several large lakes or ''loughs''. The center of the country is part of the River Shannon watershed, containing large areas of [[bogland]], used for [[peat]] production.

The local [[temperate climate]] is modified by the [[North Atlantic Current]] and is relatively mild. Summers are rarely very hot, but it freezes only occasionally in winter. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is very common, with up to 275 days with rain in some parts of the country. Chief cities are the capital [[Dublin]] on the east coast, [[Cork]] in the south, [[Galway]] and [[Limerick City|Limerick]] on the west coast, and [[Waterford City|Waterford]] on the south east coast (see [[Cities in Ireland]]).

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland]]''

The economy of the Republic of Ireland has transformed in recent years from an agricultural focus to one dependent on trade, industry and investment. While still small compared to its European neighbours, its growth is averaging a robust 10% in [[1995]]–[[2000]], and 7% in [[1995]]-[[2004]]. [[Industry]], which accounts for 46% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labor force, now takes the place of [[agriculture]] as the country's leading sector. 

Exports play a fundamental role in the state's rampant growth, but the economy also benefits from the accompanying  rise in consumer spending, construction, and business investment. On paper, the country is the largest exporter of software-related goods and services in the world. In fact, a lot of foreign software, and sometimes music, is filtered through the country to avail of the state's non-taxing of royalties from copyrighted goods.

One key reason for the country's economic surge might be her government's role in the past ten years. A number of programs to address the problems of high [[inflation]] (with poor results in recent years), large tax burdens, government spending, lack-luster foreign investment and low job skills have been introduced.

A key part of economic policy, since 1987, has been [[Social Partnership]] which is a [[neo-corporatist]] set of voluntary 'pay pacts' between the Government, employers and trades unions. These usually set agreed pay rises for three-year periods.

The state joined in launching the [[euro]] currency system in January [[1999]] (leaving behind the [[Irish pound]]) along with ten other EU nations. The [[1995]] to [[2000]] period of high economic growth led many to call the country the [[Celtic Tiger]]. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in [[2001]], particularly in the high-tech export sector — the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. GDP growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002. Growth for 2004 was over 4% and it is expected to be 5% or higher for 2005.

With high growth came high levels of inflation, particularly in the capital city. Prices in [[Dublin]], where nearly 30% of Ireland's population lives, are considerably higher than elsewhere in the country [http://www.finfacts.com/Private/bestprice/irishconsumerprices.pdf], especially in the [[Irish Property Bubble | booming property market]].

Ireland has the fourth-highest [[GDP]] (based on [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) per capita in the world after [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and the [[United States]], but lies 8th in the [[Human Development Index|2005 UN Human Development Index]], which counts GDP per capita as a factor. This indicates that life expectancy (77.56 in 2005), which place Ireland at about 32nd in the world, currently trails behind economic growth and [[literacy]] (99.9% in 2005 [http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf]).

[[The Economist]] Intelligence Unit's Quality of Life Index ([http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf]) placed Ireland in 1st place in its World in Review 2005 survey.

Poverty figures show that 10% of Ireland's population live below the [[poverty line]]
(1997 [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ie.html]). [[UNICEF]] figures show Ireland has the 6th highest child poverty rate in the developed world at 16.8% ([http://www.nationmaster.com/graph-T/eco_chi_pov]).

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of the Republic of Ireland]]''

The Irish peoples are mainly of indigenous origin, with the country's only significant minorities having descended from the Vikings and Anglo-Normans. An indigenous minority group is the [[Irish Traveller]], while some of the population are also of English, Scottish, and Welsh descent.
[[Image:Stpatrickcathedral dublin.jpg|thumb|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin<br><small>The National Cathedral of the Church of Ireland.</small>]] 
The official languages are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. Teaching of the Irish language is compulsory in primary and secondary level schools which receive money and recognition from the state. Some students may be exempt from the requirement to receive instruction in the language. [[English language|English]] is by far the predominant language spoken throughout the country. People living in predominantly Irish-speaking communities (the [[Gaeltacht]]) are limited to the low tens of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard. Roads signs are usually bilingual, except in the [[Gaeltacht]], where they are in Irish only. The legal status of place names has recently been the subject of controversy, with an order made in [[2005]] under the [[Official Languages Act 2003|Official Languages Act]] changing the official name of certain locations from English to Irish (e.g. [[Dingle]] is now officially named ''An Daingean''). Most public notices are only in [[English language|English]], as is most of the print media. National media in Irish exists on TV and radio.

The Republic of Ireland is 92% nominally [[Roman Catholic]], but there has been a massive decline in mass attendance among [[Irish Catholic]]s. Between [[1996]] and [[2001]], regular [[Roman Catholic Mass|Mass]] attendance, already previously in decline, declined from 60% to 48% (it had been 90%+ in [[1973]]), and all but two of its seminaries have closed.

The second largest Christian denomination, the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglicanism]]), having been in decline for most of the twentieth century, has now experienced an increase in membership, according to the 2002 census, as have other small Christian denominations, and [[Islam]]. The largest other Protestant denominations are the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] , followed by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]. The very small [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in the state has continued to decline in numbers (See [[History of the Jews in Ireland|Judaism in Ireland]])

Ireland is also home to a variety of small immigrant populations. According to the 2002 census, conducted by the Central Statistics Office, the largest EU groups are from: Britain, [[Germany]] and [[France]]; the largest non-EU groups are from: the [[USA]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Romania]]. However, since the joining of Eastern European countries into the E.U., Ireland has received increasing numbers of immigrants.

==Culture==
[[Image:U2photo.jpg|thumb|200px|[[U2]]<br><small>The most successful Irish band of all time and one of the biggest bands internationally in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.<small>]]
''Main article: [[Culture of Ireland]]''

The island of Ireland has produced the [[Book of Kells]], [[Irish traditional music]], and writers such as [[George Berkeley]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[James Joyce]], [[George Bernard Shaw|George 
Bernard Shaw]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[W.B. Yeats]], [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[John Millington Synge]], [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Séamus Heaney]], [[Bram Stoker]] and others. Shaw, Yeats, Beckett and Heaney are [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Literature]] laureates. Other prominent writers include [[Roddy Doyle]], [[Dermot Bolger]], [[Maeve Binchy]], [[Frank McCourt]], [[Edna O'Brien]], [[Joseph O'Connor]], [[John McGahern]] and [[Colm Tóibín]].

[[Ernest Walton]] of [[Trinity College Dublin]] shared the [[1951]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "splitting the atom". [[William Rowan Hamilton]] was a significant mathematician.
[[Image:Rory Munich 75.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rory Gallagher]]<br><small>Gallagher's musical skills won plaudits  from [[Eric Clapton]] and were credited with influencing many top guitarists in the rock idiom.</small>]] 
Figures influential in music included [[Blues]] [[guitar]]ist [[Rory Gallagher]], folk singer [[Christy Moore]], [[Shane MacGowan]] with his band [[The Pogues]] and singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]]. Successful entertainment exports in the late twentieth century include acts such as [[U2]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[The Corrs]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[Enya]], and the internationally acclaimed dance shows ''[[Riverdance]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Dance]]''. In [[European classical music|classical music]], the Island of Ireland was also the birthplace of the notable composers [[Turlough O'Carolan]], [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] (inventer of the [[Nocturne]]), [[Michael William Balfe]], ''Sir'' [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]].
