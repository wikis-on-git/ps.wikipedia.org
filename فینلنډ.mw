The '''د فېنلانډ جمهوريت''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''Suomen tasavalta'' [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]]: ''Republiken Finland'') is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] in northeastern [[Europe]], bounded by the [[Baltic Sea]] to the southwest, the [[Gulf of Finland]] to the south, and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to the west. Finland has land frontiers with [[Sweden]], [[ناروې]], and [[روسيه]]. The [[Åland|Åland Islands]], off the southwestern coast, are under Finnish [[sovereignty]] while enjoying extensive [[self-governance|autonomy]]. The commonly used [[Finnish language|Finnish ]] name for the country is '''Suomi''', the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] name '''Finland'''. (In [[Latin language|Latin]], Finland is '''Fennia''', which is used in scientific naming.)

Finland has a population of five million people spread over more than 330,000 square kilometres (127,000&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]). Being sparsely populated, the country ranks [[List of countries by population density|162nd]] in population density. 

Finland is ranked thirteenth on the 2005 [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]].

==تاريخ==

''Main article: [[د فېنلانډ تاريخ]]''

Conclusive [[archaeological]] evidence exists indicating that the area now comprising Finland was settled around [[8th millennium BC|8500 BC]], during the [[Stone Age]], as the inland ice of the last [[ice age]] receded. The earliest people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, living primarily off what the tundra and sea could offer. [[Pottery]] is known from around [[6th millennium BC|5300 BC]]. The existence of extensive exchange systems is indicated by the spread of [[asbestos]] and [[soapstone]] from eastern Finland, and by finds of [[flint]] from southern Scandinavia and Russia, [[chisel]]s from [[Lake Onega]], and spearheads from northern Scandinavia. It is probable that the speakers of the [[Finno-Ugric]] language arrived in Finland during the Stone Age, and were possibly even among the first [[Mesolithic]] settlers. The arrival of the [[Battle-axe people|Battle-Axe Culture]] (or Cord-Ceramic Culture) in southern Finland around [[3200 BC]] like coincided with the start of [[agriculture]]. However, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy, especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The [[Bronze Age]] (1500&ndash;500 BC) and [[Iron Age]] (500 BC&ndash;AD 1200) were characterized by extensive contacts with [[Scandinavia]], northern [[Russia]] and the Baltic region. Inhabitants of Finland - like the [[Kvens]] - are briefly mentioned in some historic chronicles and other writings such as the Scandinavian sagas.  There are also some written documents from the 13th century, but in general the Finnish history is not comprehensively documented before the 14th and 15th centuries.

The beginning of Finland's nearly 700-year association with the Kingdom of [[Sweden]] is traditionally connected with the year 1154 and the hypothesized [[Christianization|introduction of Christianity]] by Sweden's [[Eric IX of Sweden|King Erik]]. However, archeological evidence points to prior Christian influences in southwestern and southeastern Finland. Historically the union began upon [[Birger Jarl]]'s expedition to Finland in 1249. [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] became the dominant language of administration and education; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] chiefly a language for the [[peasantry]], [[clergy]] and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas. Not until the 16th century were the first written works published in Finnish by [[Mikael Agricola]].
{{portal}}
The Swedish Kingdom strove to push the borders eastward, which led to wars of varying success with [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]]. The expansion was halted by the unification of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and was eventually rolled back. During the 18th century, virtually all of Finland was twice occupied by Russian forces (1714&ndash;1721 and 1742&ndash;1743), known by the Finns as the [[Greater Wrath]] and the [[Lesser Wrath]]. After that, "Finland" became the predominant term for the area &mdash; both in domestic Swedish debate and by Russians promising protection from "Swedish oppression."

In 1808, Finland was conquered by the armies of [[Alexander I of Russia|Russian Emperor Alexander I]] and thereafter remained an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] of the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. To sever the cultural and emotional ties with Sweden, the Finnish language was ardently promoted by both the imperial court and the Finnish government and a strong [[ethnic nationalism|nationalist]] movement, known as [[fennoman]]ia, starting in the 1860s. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's [[national epic]], the [[Kalevala]], in 1835; and the Finnish language achieving legally status equal with Swedish in 1892.

On [[December 6]], [[1917]], shortly after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, [[Finland's declaration of independence|Finland declared its independence]]. The independence was approved by [[Bolshevist Russia]], but the civil wars that followed [[Russian Civil War|in Russia]] and [[Finnish Civil War|in Finland]], and [[nationalist activism|activist]] expeditions (called [[Heimosodat (Finland)|Heimosodat]], or "tribal wars" in Finnish), including the [[Viena expedition|to White Karelia]] and [[Aunus expedition|to Aunus]], complicated relations.

In 1918, the country experienced a brief but bitter [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] that coloured domestic politics for many years. The Civil War was fought between "the whites", who gained support from [[Imperial Germany]], and "the reds", supported by Bolshevist Russia. The reds consisted mostly of leftist property–less rural and industrial workers who, despite [[universal suffrage]] in 1906, felt that they lacked political influence. The white forces were mostly made up of bourgeoisie and wealthy peasantry, politically more to the right. Eventually, the whites overcame the reds.

The Finnish&ndash;Russian border was agreed to in the [[Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, largely following the historic border but granting [[Petsamo]] and its [[Barents Sea]] harbour to Finland.

During [[World War II]], Finland fought the [[Soviet Union]] twice: in the [[Winter War]] of 1939&ndash;1940 and in the [[Continuation War]] of 1941&ndash;1944, in time closely following [[Operation Barbarossa]], the [[Nazi Germany|German]] invasion of the Soviet Union. This was followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944&ndash;1945, when Finland forced the Germans out of northern Finland.

Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations, restraints, and reparations on Finland vis-à-vis the Soviet Union as well as further Finnish territorial concessions (cf. the [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940]]). Finland ceded most of [[Finnish Karelia]], [[Salla]], and Petsamo. The reparations to Soviet Union forced Finland to transform from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialized one, and even after reparation debts were cleared Finland continued to supply the Soviet Union. (Russia has assumed a large part of the unpaid Soviet national debt which is slowly being remunerated in kind with raw materials and electricity)

After the Second World War, Finland lay in the grey zone between western countries and Soviet Union. The "[[YYA Treaty]]" (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics and included a guarantee whereby Finland promised to defend her territory and airspace against [[Germany]] or her allies, which meant in practice [[NATO]]. Many politicians, like [[Urho Kekkonen|President Kekkonen]] (1956&ndash;[[1981|81]]), used their relations with Moscow to solve party controversies, which meant that the Soviet Union gained even more influence; other people worked single-mindedly to oppose the Kremlin. The society had also a strong tendency of self-censorship regarding Fenno-Soviet relations and the Soviet Union, and the press was often reprimanded or given instructions in handling Soviet-related issues. There was virtually no criticism or objective discussion of communism or the Soviet Union in Finland during those years. This phenomenon of self-censorship was given the name [[finlandisation]] by German press. However, Finland maintained a democratic government and market economy, unlike other countries bordering the Soviet Union.

The post-war era was a period of rapid economic growth and increasing wealth and stability for Finland. The war-ravaged agrarian country was transformed into a technologically advanced market economy with a sophisticated social welfare system.

When the [[fall of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union fell]] in 1991 Finland was surprised and suffered economically, but was free to follow her own course. She joined the [[European Union]] in 1995, where she is an advocate of [[federalism]], contrary to the other [[Nordic countries]] that are predominantly supportive of [[confederalism]].

==آرپوهه==
The name ''Suomi'' has uncertain origins, but a strong candidate is Baltic ''zheme'' "ground, earth, country", which is consistent with Finnic peoples traditionally calling themselves ''maaväki'' "country people". Furthermore, ''suo'' means "bog", which is the characteristic biotype of Finland.

The exonym ''Finland'', which is not found in Finnish, has resemblance with e.g. the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] [[placename]]s [[Finnmark]], [[Finnveden]] and [[Finnskogen]] and all are thought to be derived from ''finn'', an ancient Germanic word for [[nomadic]] "[[hunter-gatherer]]s" (as opposed to sedentary farmers). This would explain the connection between these names and the modern nation called [[Finns]], a few of whom were nomadic or semi-nomadic until the [[Middle Ages]] beside the farming majority.

==سياست==
[[Image:Stairs_of_Finnish_Parliament.jpg|thumb|[[Finnish Parliament]] House in [[Helsinki]]]]
''Main article: [[Politics of Finland]]''

Finland has a [[semi-presidential system]] with [[Parliamentarism]]. The [[President of Finland]] is formally responsible for [[Foreign policy of Finland|foreign policy]]. Most executive power lies in the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] (the [[Finnish Council of State]]) headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland|prime minister]] chosen by the [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]].  The Council of State is made up of the prime minister and the ministers for the various departments of the central government as well as an ex-officio member, the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]].

The 200-member [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] is called the ''Eduskunta'' (Finnish) or ''Riksdag'' (Swedish). It is the supreme legislative authority in Finland. The parliament may alter the [[Constitution of Finland]], bring about the resignation of the Council of State, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review. [[Legislation]] may be initiated by the Council of State, or one of the Eduskunta members, who are elected for a four-year term  on the basis of proportional representation through [[open list]] multimember districts.

The [[judicial system of Finland]] is divided between [[court (judicial)|courts]] with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with responsibility for litigation between the individuals and the administrative organs of the state and the communities. Their jurisdiction can be illustrated with an example: Parents unsatisfied with the school placement of their child would appeal against the board of education in an administrative court as the school placement is subject to an administrative decision. Finnish law is codified and its court system consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]]. The administrative process has more popularity as it is cheaper and has lower financial risk to the person making claims. In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. There is also a [[Judicial system of Finland#High Court of Impeachment|High Court of Impeachment]] for criminal charges (for an offence in office) against the President of the Republic, the justices of the supreme courts, members the Council of State, the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]] and the [[Ombudsman#Finland|Ombudsman]] of Parliament.

The parliament has, since [[equal and common suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, been dominated by [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|secular Conservatives]], [[Centre Party of Finland|the Centre Party (former Agrarian Union)]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. After 1944 [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a factor to consider for few decades. The [[Swedish People's Party in Finland|Swedish People's Party]] represents Finland Swedes, especially in language politics. The relative strengths of the parties vary only slightly in the elections due to the proportional election from multimember districts but there are some visible long-term trends. 

It should be noted that the Finnish political system remained democratic during the [[Cold War]], although the political atmosphere was largely influenced by the neighbouring [[Soviet Union]] and a certain degree of self-censorship.

The [[constitution of Finland]] and its place in the judicial system are unusual in that there is no constitutional court and the supreme court does not have an explicit right to declare a law unconstitutional.  In principle, the constitutionality of laws in Finland is verified by a simple vote in the parliament. However, the Constitutional Law Committee of the parliament reviews any doubtful bills and recommends changes, if needed. In practice, the Constitutional Law Committee fulfils the duties of the constitutional court. A Finnish peculiarity is the possibility to make exceptions to the constitution in usual laws that are enacted in the same procedure as constitutional amendments. An example of such law is the State of Preparedness Act which gives the Council of State certain exceptional powers in cases of national emergency. As these powers, which correspond the US executive orders, affect the constitutional basic rights, the law was enacted in the same manner as a constitutional amendment. However, it can be repealed in the same manner as a usual law.  In addition to the preview of the Constitutional Law Committee, all Finnish courts of law have the obligation to give precedence to the constitution when there is an obvious conflict between the constitution and a regular law. That is, however, very rare. The only other European countries that lack a constitutional court are the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (which does not have a codified constitution).

==Subdivisions==
''Main article: [[Municipalities of Finland]]''

Legally, Finland has two levels of democratic government: the state and the municipalities. Although a municipality must follow the laws set by the state, it makes independent decisions. The municipality is the same as a "city" level of government, except that rural municipalities are not called "cities". People often identify with their municipality, although their nationality is usually more important.

''Main articles:[[Subdivisions of Finland]], [[Provinces of Finland]], [[Historical provinces of Finland]]''
[[Image:Map of Finland with provinces (numbered).png|right|Provinces of Finland]]
The state organization is divided into [[Provinces of Finland|6 administrative provinces]] ''(lääni, [[plural|pl.]] läänit)'' The provinces are further divided into 90 [[State Local Districts of Finland|state local districts]]. 
The provincial authority is part of the executive branch of the national government, and is not democratically controlled except through the national parliament. This system was created in 1634, and underwent few major changes until the redivision of the country into "greater provinces" in 1997. Since then, the six provinces have been:

#[[Southern Finland]]
#[[Western Finland]]
#[[Eastern Finland]]
#[[Oulu Province|Oulu]]
#[[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]]
#[[Åland]]

These provinces are merely administrative divisions. Western Finland, for example, spans four major linguistic and dialectal areas (Pohjanmaa dialect, Southwestern dialects, Savo in [[Ähtäri]], and some Swedish speakers in the area around Vaasa).

The [[Åland|Åland Islands]] enjoy a degree of [[self-governance|autonomy]]. According to international treaties and Finnish laws, the regional government for Åland handles some matters which belong to the province authority in [[Mainland Finland]].

Another kind of provinces are those echoing the pattern of colonisation of Finland. [[Dialect]]s, [[folklore]], [[Convention (philosophy and social sciences)|customs]], and people's feeling of affiliation are associated with these [[historical provinces of Finland]], although the re-settlement of 420,000 [[Karelia]]ns during [[World War II]] and [[urbanization]] in the latter half of the 20th century have made differences less pronounced.

Local government is further organised in 432 (1.1.2005) [[municipalities of Finland]]. Since 1977, no legal or administrative distinction is made between [[List of towns in Finland|towns]], cities and other municipalities. The municipalities co-operate in 20 [[regions of Finland]]. There are also 74 [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] with similar tasks as the regions.

==جغرافيه==
[[Image:P%C3%A4ij%C3%A4nne_and_p%C3%A4ij%C3%A4tsalo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Päijänne]], one the largest lakes.]]
[[Image:Nakyma_ukkokolilta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Koli]], one of the many national parks.]]
''Main article: [[د فېنلانډ جغرافيه]]''

Finland is a country of thousands of lakes and islands; 187,888 lakes and 179,584 islands to be precise. One of these lakes, [[Saimaa]], is the 5th largest in Europe. The Finnish landscape is mostly flat with few hills and its highest point, the [[Haltitunturi]] at 1,328 metres (4,357 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is found in the extreme north of [[Lapland]]. Beside the many lakes the landscape is dominated by extensive [[boreal]] forests (about 68 percent of land area) and little [[arable land]]. The greater part of the islands are found in southwest, part of the [[archipelago]] of the [[Åland|Åland Islands]], and along the southern coast in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Finland is one of the few countries in the world that are still growing. Owing to the [[isostatic uplift]] that has been taking place since the last [[ice age]], the surface area of the country is growing by about 7 square kilometres (2.7 [[square mile|sq mi]]) a year.

The [[climate]] in Southern Finland is a northern [[temperate climate]]. In Northern Finland, particularly in the [[Lapland, Finland|Province of Lapland]], a [[subarctic climate]] dominates, characterised by cold, occasionally severe, winters and relatively warm summers. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic to be continuously warmed by the [[Gulf stream]], which explains the unusually warm climate considering the absolute latitude.

A quarter of Finland's territory lies above the [[Arctic Circle]], and as a consequence the [[midnight sun]] can be experienced &mdash; for more and more days, the further up north one comes. At Finland's northernmost point, the sun does not set for 73 days during summer, and does not rise at all for 51 days in winter.

==اقتصاد==
[[Image:Fortumin_p%C3%A4%C3%A4konttori.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Fortum]]. The economy used to be dominated by large industries.]]
''Main article: [[Economy of Finland]]''

Finland is, in terms of economy, a part of Western Europe and has a highly industrialised, largely free-market economy, with per capita output roughly equal to that of for example [[Sweden]],[[United Kingdom|UK]], [[France]] or [[Italy]]. Its key economic sector is [[manufacturing]] - principally the wood, metals, engineering, [[telecommunication]]s (especially [[Nokia]]), and electronics industries. Trade is important, with exports equalling almost one-third of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Except for [[timber]] and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. 

Because of the climate, [[agriculture|agricultural]] development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. [[Forestry]], an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. Rapidly increasing integration with Western Europe - Finland was one of the 11 countries joining the [[euro]] monetary system ([[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]]) on [[January 1]], [[1999]] - will dominate the economic picture over the next several years. 

According to [[Transparency International]], Finland has the second lowest level of [[political corruption|corruption]] in all the countries [[index of perception of corruption|studied in their survey]]. (Finland had topped the list of least corruption for several years, but [[Iceland]] took the best ranking in 2005.) Finland has been declared the most competitive country in the world for three consecutive years 2003-2005 (four times in the last five years) by the World Economic Forum. [http://www.weforum.org/]

==Globalization==
[[Image:Helsinki-Vantaan_kiitotie_33.jpg|thumb|[[Helsinki-Vantaa airport]].]]
Finland's unique relationship with first [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]], then the [[Soviet Union]] and now the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] has profoundly impacted its foreign policies and ability to globalise. Finnish globalisation was tempered by the necessity not to provoke their giant neighbour. Despite these hindrances, Finland eventually became one of the most globalised nations in the world.

After the [[history of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Finland took that opportunity to free itself from the restrictions imposed on it by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]]. Free from Soviet influence, Finland was able to begin pursuing goals that better fit Finnish ideology. The Finnish-Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance (and the restrictions included therein) was annulled, but Finland recognised the Russian Federation as the successor to the USSR, and was quick to draft bilateral treaties of goodwill.

Finland began integrating itself into Western institutions, while not abandoning neutrality completely. Finland's policy of neutrality was moderated further from "active neutrality" to "military non-alignment", with an emphasis on maintaining a competent independent defence. Finland joined the [[European Union]] in 1995. [[Peacekeeping]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] is the only real extra-national military responsibility which Finland undertakes.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Finland]]''
[[Image:Population concentrations in Finland.gif|thumb|right|Population density. Map: Statistics Finland]]
There are two [[official language]]s in Finland: [[Finnish (language)|Finnish]], spoken by 92% of the population, and [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]], [[mother tongue]] for 5.5% of the population. [[Ethnic Finn]]s and [[Finland Swedes]] are generally considered to comprise a common [[nation]]. The Finland-Swedes are concentrated in the coastal areas, and there is a slight cultural difference between the culture of the Ethnic Finns, focused on lakes and woods, and the more outward-oriented coastal culture of the Finland-Swedes. This difference may be considered as an [[ethnic]] division, but the difference is slight and not more pronounced than the difference between [[East Finnish culture|East Finnish]] and [[West Finnish culture]].

Other minority languages include [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. To the north, in [[Lapland]], are found the [[Sami people|Sami]], numbering less than 7,000, who like the Finns speak a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] language. There are three [[Sami languages]] that are spoken in Finland: [[Northern Sami]], [[Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami]]. The right of minority groups (in particular Sami and Roma people) to cherish their culture and language is protected by law, but usually only Sami is considered to be an official minority language.

Of religion, most Finns (83,1%) are members of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], with a minority of 1% belonging to the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] (see [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]). These two churches are the [[state church]]es of Finland. The remainder  of the population consists of relatively small groups of other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, [[Roman Catholics]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Judaism|Jews]] beside the growing population of unaffiliated (15%).

After the [[Winter War]] (1939) (and confirmed by the outcome of the [[Continuation War]]) 12% of Finland's population had to be re-settled. [[War reparations]], unemployment, and uncertainty regarding Finland's chances to remain [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[independent (nation)|independent]] of the [[Soviet Union]] contributed to considerable [[emigration]], abating first in the 1970s. Until then, some 500,000 Finns had emigrated, chiefly to [[Sweden]], although half of the emigrants ultimately re-migrated again.

Since the late 1990s, Finland has received [[refugee]]s and [[immigrant]]s at a rate comparable with the other [[Nordic countries]], although the total ethnic-minority population remains far lower in Finland than the rest. A considerable number of immigrants have come from the former Soviet Union claiming [[ethnic]] ([[Finnic]]) kinship. However, over 20 languages are now spoken in Finland by immigrant groups of significant size &mdash; that is, with at least a thousand speakers.

Finland's population has always been concentrated in the southern parts of the country, which is even more pronounced after the 20th century [[urbanization]]. The biggest and most important cities in Finland are the [[Greater Helsinki]] metropolitan area (including the cities of [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]] and [[Vantaa]]), [[Tampere]], [[Turku]], and [[Oulu]].

After having one of the highest death rates from [[heart disease]] in the world in the 1970s, improvements in the Finnish diet and exercise have paid off. Finland is now one of the fittest countries in the world. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/befit/story/0,15652,1385645,00.html]

''Main article: [[Culture of Finland]]''

Finnish culture has been influenced by eastern European culture ([[Russia]] and [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region), western European culture (particularly [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]]) and [[United States|America]]n culture. Many Finns, particularly young, are also in increasing contact with cultures outside the nearby cultural sphere.

There are still differences between regions, especially minor differences in accents and vocabulary. Minorities maintain own cultural characteristics, such as Sami culture and Finland Swedes culture. Many Finns are emotionally connected to countryside and nature, because urbanization is relatively late phenomenon.

===Public holidays===
''Main article: [[Public holidays in Finland]]''
[[Image:Runebergintorttu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Runeberg's tart]], is a Finnish pastry available on the poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]]'s birthday.]]

All official holidays in Finland are established by acts of [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]]. The official holidays can be divided into [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays, although some of the Christian holidays have replaced holidays of pagan origin. The main Christian holidays are [[Christmas]], [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], [[Easter]], [[Ascension|Ascension Day]], [[Pentecost]], and [[All Saints Day]]. The secular holidays are [[New Year's Day]], [[May Day]], [[Midsummer Day]], and [[Finland Independence Day|Independence Day]].

In addition to this all Sundays are official holidays but they are not as important as the special holidays. The names of the Sundays follow the liturgical calendar and they can be categorised as Christian holidays. When the standard working week in Finland was reduced to 40 hours by an act of Parliament it also meant that all Saturdays became a sort of de facto public holidays, though not official ones. Easter Sunday and Pentecost are Sundays that form part of a main holiday and they are preceded by a kind of special Saturdays.

Retail stores are prohibited by law from doing business on Sundays, except during the summer months (May through August) and in the pre-Christmas season (November and December). Business locations that have less than 400 square meters of floor space are allowed Sunday business throughout the year, with the exception of official holidays and certain Sundays, such as Mothers' Day and Fathers' Day.
