The '''Kingdom of Swaziland''' is a small, [[landlocked]] country in [[southern Africa]] (one of the smallest on the continent), situated on the eastern slope of the [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg mountains]], embedded between [[سوېلي افريقا]] in the west and [[موزمبيق]] in the east. The country is named after the [[Swazi]], a [[Bantu]] tribe. Due in part to a high rate of [[HIV]] infection, Swaziland has the world's lowest [[life expectancy]], 32.62 years.
== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Swaziland]]''

Human remains and artifacts from more than 100,000 years ago have been found in Swaziland. The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They were largely replaced by Bantu tribes during [[Bantu]] [[human migration|migrations]]. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the [[4th century]], and people speaking languages ancestral to current [[Sotho]] and [[Nguni]] languages began settling no later than the [[11th century]]. The ruling Dlamini lineage had chiefships in the region in the [[18th century]].  An enlarged Swazi kingdom was established by Sobhuza I in the early [[19th century]].  Soon thereafter the first whites started to settle in the area.  In the [[1890s]] the [[South African Republic]] in the [[Transvaal]] claimed sovereignty over Swaziland but never fully established power. After the [[South African War]] of [[1899]]–[[1902]], Swaziland became a British protectorate. The country was eventually granted independence on [[September 6]], [[1968]].  Since then, Swaziland has seen a struggle between pro-democracy activists and the totalitarian monarchy.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Swaziland}}
The [[head of state]] is the king, who since [[1986]] has been [[King Mswati III]]. By tradition, the king reigns along with his mother (the ''Indlovukazi'', lit. ''Great She-Elephant''), the former viewed as the administrative head of state and the latter as a spiritual and national head of state.  As the monarch, the king not only appoints the prime minister — the head of government — but also appoints a small number of representatives for both chambers of the [[Parliament of Swaziland|Libandla]] (parliament). The [[Senate of Swaziland|Senate]] consists of 30 members, while the [[House of Assembly of Swaziland|House of Assembly]] has 65 seats, 55 of which are occupied by elected representatives (elections are held every 5 years in November).

The 1968 constitution was suspended in 1973 in a State of Emergency decree presumably  still in force today, though the government claims that it has been dissolved. In [[2001]] King Mswati III appointed a committee to draft a new constitution. Drafts were released for comment in May 2003 and November 2004. However they were strongly criticised by civil society organizations in Swaziland and human rights organisations elsewhere. In 2005, the constitution was put into to effect though there is still much debate in the country about that issue.

[[King Mswati III]] is often criticized for living so lavishly in a nation that is afflicted by the world's highest [[HIV]] infection rates.  His fleet of luxury cars, and the millions spent towards refurbishing his numerous wives' luxury mansions, are at odds with the approximately 34 percent of the nation that stand unemployed, nearly 70 percent of which live on less than a dollar a day, and with around 39 percent of adults who are afflicted by HIV.

== Districts ==
[[دوتنه:SwazilandNumbered.png|thumb|Districts of Swaziland]]
''Main article: [[Districts of Swaziland]]''

Swaziland is divided into four districts:

# [[Hhohho]]
# [[Lubombo]]
# [[Manzini District|Manzini]]
# [[Shiselweni]]

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Wz-map.gif|thumb|220px|Map of Swaziland]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Swaziland]]''

Swaziland offers a wide variety of landscapes, from the mountains along the Mozambican border to [[savanna]]s in the east and [[rainforest]] in the northwest. Several rivers flow through the country, such as the [[Lusutfu River]]. With 50,000 inhabitants, the capital city - Mbabane - is the largest town in the nation; others include [[Manzini]], [[Lobamba]] and [[Siteki]].

== Labour ==
Swaziland is in the process or formulating an [[Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (Swaziland)|Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]], which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007.
