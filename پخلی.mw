'''پخلی''' د خوړلو لپاره د خواړو د چمتو کولو يا پخولو کړنې ته وايي. همدا ويی د خواړو پخولو ټولې طريقې په ځان کې رانغاړي. پدې کې ډېرې داسې ګڼ شمېر طريقې، د بېلابېلو شيانو او اوزارو ګډون چې د خواړو خوند او يا هاضمې کې مرسته کوي دا ټول راځي. دا د خوړلو لپاره د وړ خوړنتوکو د ټاکلو، د خوړنتوکو د تللو او د هيلمنو پايلو په موخه، د خوړنتوکو د يوځای کولو يوه باترتيبه پروسه ګڼل کېږي. هغه څه چې په پای کې لاس ته راغلي پاخه شوي خواړه اغېزمن کوي، هغه د بېلابېلو خوړنتوکو شتون،   ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.

The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural and religious considerations that impact upon it.

Cooking often requires applying heat to a food, which usually, though not always, [[chemistry|chemically]] transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, appearance, and nutritional properties. There is archaeological evidence of [[roasted]] foodstuffs, both animal and vegetable, in human (''[[Homo erectus]]'') campsites dating from the earliest known use of [[fire]], some 800,000 years ago. Other methods of cooking that involve the boiling of [[liquid]] in a receptacle have been practiced at least since the [[10th millennium BC]], with the introduction of [[pottery]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== پروټينونه===
Edible animal material, including [[muscle]], [[offal]], [[milk]] and [[egg white]], contains substantial amounts of [[protein]]. Almost all [[vegetable]] matter (in particular [[legumes]] and [[seeds]]) also includes proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. These may also be a source of [[essential amino acid]]s. When [[protein]]s are heated they become de-natured and change texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more friable - meat becomes ''cooked''. In some cases, proteins can  form more rigid structures, such as the coagulation of [[albumen]] in egg whites. The formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component of much [[cake]] cookery, and also underpins many desserts based on [[meringue]].

=== مايعات===
Cooking often involves [[liquids]], both added in order to immerse the substances being cooked (typically [[water]], [[stock (food)|stock]] or [[wine]]), and released from the foods themselves. Liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used may be based on how the liquid is combined with the food, as in [[steam]]ing, [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], [[braising]] and [[blanching]]. Heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased [[evaporation]], which [[concentrate]]s the remaining flavors and ingredients - this is a critical component of both [[stewing]] and [[sauce]] making.

=== غوړ===
[[Fat]]s and [[cooking oil|oils]] come from both animal and plant sources. In cooking, fats provide tastes and textures. When used as the principal cooking medium (rather than water), they also allow the cook access to a wide range of cooking temperatures. Common oil-cooking techniques include [[saute]]ing, [[stir-frying]], and [[deep-frying]]. Commonly used fats and oils include [[butter]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[lard]], beef fat (both [[dripping]] and [[tallow]]), [[rapeseed]] oil or [[Canola]], and [[peanut]] oil. The inclusion of fats tends to add flavour to cooked food, even though the taste of the oil on its own is often unpleasant. This fact has encouraged the popularity of high fat foods, many of which are classified as [[junk food]] such as [[hamburger]]s or convenience fried cereal snacks.

=== کاربوهايډرېټ===
[[Carbohydrate]]s used in cooking include simple [[sugar]]s such as [[glucose]] (from table sugar) and [[fructose]] (from fruit), and [[starch]]es from sources such as cereal flour, [[rice]], [[arrowroot]], [[potato]]. The interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex. 

Long-chain sugars such as starch tend to break down into more [[Monosaccharide|simple sugar]]s when cooked, while simple sugars can form [[syrup]]s. If sugars are heated so that all water of [[crystallisation]] is driven off, then [[caramelisation]] starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of [[carbon]], and other breakdown products producing [[caramel]]. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the [[Maillard reaction]], a basic flavor-enhancing technique. 

An [[emulsion]] of starch with [[fat]] or [[water]] can, when gently heated, provide thickening to the dish being cooked. In [[European]] cooking, a mixture of [[butter]] and [[flour]] called a [[roux]] is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces. In [[Asian]] cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of [[rice]] or [[corn]] starch and water. These techniques rely on the properties of [[starch]]es to create simpler mucilaginous [[saccharide]]s during cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of [[sauce]]s. This thickening will break down, however, under additional heat.

{{mainarticle|Food safety}}
If heat is used in the preparation of food, this can kill or inactivate potentially harmful organisms including [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es. The effect will depend on temperature, cooking time, and technique used. The temperature range from 5°C to 57°C (41°F to 135°F) is the "food danger zone." Between these temperatures bacteria can grow rapidly. Under the correct conditions bacteria can double in number every twenty minutes. The food may not appear any different or spoiled but can be harmful to anyone who eats it. [[Meat]], [[poultry]], dairy products, and other prepared food must be kept outside of the "food danger zone" to remain safe to eat. [[Refrigeration]] and freezing do not kill bacteria, but only slow their growth. When cooling hot food, it shouldn't be left on the side or in a blast chiller (an appliance used to quickly cool food) for more than 90 minutes.   

[[Cutting board]]s are a potential breeding ground for bacteria, and can be quite hazardous unless safety precautions are taken.  Plastic cutting boards are less porous than wood and have conventionally been assumed to be far less likely to harbor bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html|title=Cutting Boards (Plastic Versus Wood)|publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture & Life Sciences, the University of Arizona|work=Food Safety, Preparation and Storage Tips|date=1998|accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> This has been debated, and some research have shown wooden boards are far better.<ref name="ReluctantGourmet">{{cite web|url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|title=Cutting Boards - wood or plastic?|work=ReluctantGourmet.com|accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> Washing and [[sanitize|sanitizing]] cutting boards is highly recommended, especially after use with raw meat, poultry, or seafood.  Hot water and soap followed by a rinse with an antibacterial cleaner (dilute bleach is common in a mixture of 1 [[tablespoon]] per [[gallon]] of water, as at that dilution it is considered food safe, though some professionals choose not to use this method because they believe it could taint some foods), or a trip through a dishwasher with a "sanitize" cycle, are effective methods for reducing the risk of illness due to contaminated cooking implements.<ref name="ReluctantGourmet"/>

The application of scientific knowledge to cooking and gastronomy has become known as [[molecular gastronomy]]. This is a subdiscipline of [[food science]]. Important contributions have been made by scientists, chefs and authors such as [[Herve This]] (chemist), [[Nicholas Kurti]] (physicist), [[Peter Barham]] (physicist), [[Harold McGee]] (author), [[Shirley Corriher]] (biochemist, author), [[Heston Blumenthal]] (chef), [[Ferran Adria]] (chef), [[Robert Wolke]] (chemist, author) and [[Pierre Gagnaire]] (chef)
