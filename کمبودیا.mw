The '''Kingdom of Cambodia''' (for the various names of the country in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], see naming section below) is a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[Southeast Asia]] with a population of more than 13 million people. A citizen of Cambodia is usually identified as '''Cambodian'''. Most Cambodians are [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] of [[Khmer people|Khmer]] extraction, but the country also has a substantial number of [[Cham people|Cham]] and small hill tribes.

Cambodia is the successor state of the once powerful [[Khmer empire|Khmer Empire]], which ruled most of the [[Indochina|Indochinese Peninsula]] between the 11th and 14th centuries.

The country shares a border with [[تايلېنډ]] to its west, with [[لاووس]] to its north, with [[وېتنام]] to its east, and with the [[Gulf of Thailand]] to its south. The geography of Cambodia is dominated by the [[Mekong]] river (colloquial [[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ''Tonle Thom'', i.e. "the great river") and the [[Tonle Sap Lake|Tonle Sap]] (i.e. "the fresh water river"), an important source of fish. 

The country has three main political parties: the [[Cambodian People's Party]], [[FUNCINPEC]] and the [[Sam Rainsy Party]]. The Cambodian People's Party, which is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, is the ruling party. In 2004, after a year of negotiations, a coalition between the Cambodian People's Party and the royalists' FUNCINPEC came to power in the National Assembly.

== Naming ==
In the [[Khmer language]], Cambodia is known by two names. 

The formal name is '''Prâteh Kampuchea''' (Khmer: [[Khmer alphabet#Styles|Mul script]] [[دوتنه:Cambodia4.png|100px]]; [[Khmer alphabet#Styles|regular script]] [[دوتنه:Cambodia1.png|80px]]), literally "the Country of Cambodia". ''Prâteh'' is a formal word meaning "country"; it comes from [[Sanskrit]] and is a cognate of the word ''[[pradesh]]'', as in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. ''Cambodia'' is the traditional [[transliteration]] of the Khmer name of the country in English, while ''Kampuchea'' is another transliteration, more faithful to the Khmer pronunciation of the word.  The French name for the country is ''Cambodge'', while the name in German is ''Kambodscha''. 

The name ''Cambodia'' is derived from that of the ancient Khmer kingdom of [[Kambuja]] (''Kambujadesa''). Kambuja or [[Kamboja]]  is the ancient Sanskrit name of an early north [[India]]n tribe, the [[Kambojas]], named after the founder of that tribe, [[Kambu Svayambhuva]], apparently a variant of [[Cambyses]]. See [[Etymology of Kamboja]]. 

The informal and colloquial name of Cambodia, the one most used by Khmer people, is '''Srok Khmae''' (regular script [[دوتنه:Cambodia2.png|55px]]) -- literally, "the Khmer Land " (the name ''Khmae'' is spelled with a final "r" in the Khmer alphabet, but this "r" is not pronounced in standard Khmer; final "r" disappeared from most dialects of Khmer pronunciation in the 19th century). ''Srok'' is a [[Mon-Khmer]] word and considered more colloquial than ''prâteh'', but both words roughly mean the same thing. ''Srok Khmae'' is used in almost every circumstance of life, whereas ''Prâteh Kampuchea'' is used on more formal occasions, such as in news programs or political speeches.

The official name of the country is '''Preahreachanachâk Kampuchea''' (Mul script [[دوتنه:Official_name_of_Cambodia.png|150px]]; regular script [[دوتنه:Cambodia3.png|130px]]), i.e. "Kingdom of Cambodia". The etymology of ''Preahreachanachâk'' is: ''Preah-'' ("sacred", cognate of the Indian word ''[[Brahmin]]''); ''-reach-'' ("king, royal, realm", from Sanskrit, cognate of the Indian words ''raja'' and ''raj'' as in [[maharaja]] and [[British Raj]], also cognate with [[German language|German]] ''[[Reich]]''); ''-ana-'' (from [[Pāli|Pali]] ''{{IPA|āṇā}}'', "authority, command, power", itself from Sanskrit ''{{IPA|ājñā}}'', same meaning) ''-châk'' (from Sanskrit ''cakra'', meaning "wheel", a symbol of power and rule).

[[دوتنه:Postagestamp-etat du cambodge-remise armes.jpg|thumb|1993 stamp showing the name ''État du Cambodge'']]
Since independence was achieved in 1953, the official name of Cambodia has changed several times, following the troubled history of the country. In English and French, the following names have been used since 1953.

* ''Kingdom of Cambodia''/''Royaume du Cambodge'' under the rule of the monarchy from 1953 through 1970;
* ''Khmer Republic''/''République khmère'' (a [[calque]] of [[French Republic]]) under the military rule of [[Lon Nol]] from 1970 to 1975;
* ''Democratic Kampuchea''/''Kampuchea démocratique'' under the rule of the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] from 1975 to 1979;
* ''People's Republic of Kampuchea''/''République populaire du Kampuchea'' (a calque of [[People's Republic of China]]) under the rule of the Vietnamese-sponsored government from 1979 to 1989;
* ''State of Cambodia''/''État du Cambodge'' (a neutral name, before deciding whether to return to monarchy or not) under the rule of the United Nations transitional authority from 1989 to 1993;
* ''Kingdom of Cambodia''/''Royaume du Cambodge'' (return to the pre-1970's name) used after the restoration of the monarchy in 1993.

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[History of Cambodia]]''

From the 9th century to the 15th century, Cambodia was the center of the [[Khmer Empire]], the capital of which was [[Angkor]]. [[Angkor Wat]], the empire's main religious site, is a symbolic reminder of Cambodia's time as a major power, and remains the country's top tourist attraction.

During the colonial period, Cambodia was a [[protectorate]] of [[France]] from 1863 until the country received independence in 1953. Cambodia was under [[Japan]]ese occupation from 1941 to 1945 during [[World War II]]. During the 1950s and 1960s the country was under the rule of [[King Norodom Sihanouk]], and maintained a fragile [[Neutral country|neutrality]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1969 the United States under the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration began [[B-52]] bombing operations in Cambodia to destroy Viet Cong bases as part of the Vietnam War. The U.S. kept the bombing secret until 1970, when U.S. forces briefly invaded Cambodia, and the bombing continued until 1973. Estimates of the number of Cambodians killed during the bombing campaigns vary widely, from 30,000 to as high as 500,000. {{fact}} The 1970s and 1980s saw a [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]], a military [[monarchist]] regime headed by [[Lon Nol]], and one of the most infamous [[genocide]]s in history under the agro-communist regime led by the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]]. The Khmer Rouge committed [[autogenocide]] against an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians who were in some way deemed to be "[[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]]", whether they were linked to the previous regime, civil servants, people of education or of religion, critics of the Khmer Rouge or [[Marxism]], or simply offered resistance to the brutal treatment of the cadres. Hundreds of thousands more fled across the border with neighbouring [[Thailand]]. 

On [[December 25]], [[1978]], Vietnam invaded Cambodia to stop Khmer Rouge incursions across the border and in response the U.S. imposed trade embargo against ''The People's Republic of Kampuchea'', the new Vietnamese-sponsored [[communist]] government. The [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration also assisted the Khmer Rouge in maintaining the fiction that it represented the legitimate government of Cambodia, by helping to retain its [[United Nations]] seat. After the brutality of the 1970s and 1980s, and the destruction of the cultural, economic, social and political life of Cambodia, it is only in recent years that reconstruction efforts have begun and some political stability has finally returned to Cambodia.

=== Ancient states: Funan and Chenla ===
The first advanced civilizations in present day Cambodia appeared in the [[1st millennium]] AD. During the [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;300s, 400s, and 500s, the Indianized states of [[Funan]] and [[Chenla]] took hold in what is now present-day Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam. These states had close relations with [[China]] and [[India]]. After these states collapsed, the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] civilization began to flourish in this area from the 9th century to the 13th century.

=== Angkor and the Khmer Empire ===
''Main article: [[Early history of Cambodia]]''
[[دوتنه:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|right|thumb|280px|A [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] army going to war against the [[Cham]], from a relief on the [[Bayon]].]]

The Angkorian period was in terms of cultural accomplishments and political power, the golden age of Cambodia. The kingdom was founded by [[Jayavarman II]] with its capital at [[Angkor]], and the [[Khmer Empire]] lasted from the early 9th century to the 15th century. The Khmers had adopted religious and political ideas and institutions from India and began to establish a centralized kingdom which dominated Southeast Asia for much of this period.

The rule of [[Jayavarman VII]] (r. 1181-ca. 1218) saw the rapid expansion of the Khmer Empire. Unlike his ancestors, who had concentrated upon the cult of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Devaraja|god-king]], Jayavarman VII was a patron of [[Theravada Buddhism]].

Jayavarman VII began building activity that included the popular [[Angkor Thom]] complex and also the [[Bayon]], a temple whose stone towers bear faces which have been identified as [[Avalokitesvara]], which are either the king himself or the guardians of the [[cardinal point]]s (Kerlogue, p. 109). He also built over 200 rest houses and hospitals throughout the empire and maintained a system of roads between his capital and provincial towns throughout the empire which would make it simpler for magistrates to collect taxes or for building projects. According to historian [[George Coedes]], "No other Cambodian king can claim to have moved so much stone." Often, quality suffered for the sake of size and rapid construction. An example of this was the beautiful but poorly constructed Bayon.

=== Foreign occupation ===
''Main article: [[Colonial Cambodia]]''
[[دوتنه:Phnom_Penh_French_Colonial.jpg|right|thumb|280px|French colonial buildings in [[Phnom Penh]]]]

After the [[Thailand|Siamese]] seized Angkor in 1431, Cambodia began to endure years of foreign domination by neighboring [[Thailand|Siam]] to the west and by [[Vietnam]] to the east. This period is known as the "[[dark ages of Cambodia]]". This period ended when Cambodia was made a [[France|French]] [[protectorate]] in 1863 and became part of [[French Indochina]]. Cambodia's chief colonial official was the Résident Supérieur (Resident General) while lesser résidents, or regional governors, were posted in all of the provincial centers. In 1897, the incumbent Resident General complained to his superiors in [[Paris]] that the current king of Cambodia, [[Norodom of Cambodia|King Norodom]], was no longer capable of ruling, and thus received permission to assume the king's roles of issuing decrees, collecting taxes, and appointing royal officials, including the next king. Norodom and his successors thus assumed the role of figureheads and heads of the Buddhist religion. Even in the colonial bureaucracy, French nationals held the highest positions, while even in the lowest rungs of the bureaucracy the colonial government preferred to hire Vietnamese.

During [[World War II]] Cambodia was occupied by the [[Japan]]ese.  After it ended in 1945, King [[Norodom Sihanouk]] demanded independence from France. With the military situation getting worse throughout Indochina, the French agreed to grant independence to the three states of [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and Cambodia in 1953. King Sihanouk, a revered hero in the eyes of his people, returned to Phnom Penh in triumph, and independence was celebrated on [[November 9]], [[1953]]. The last French officials left Cambodia in 1954 after control of residual matters affecting sovereignty, such as financial and budgetary affairs, passed to the new Cambodian state.

=== Civil war and genocide ===
''Main article: [[Democratic Kampuchea]]''
[[دوتنه:Pol=pot.jpg|thumb|180px|The leader of the [[Khmer Rouge]], [[Pol Pot]]]]

During the [[Second Indochina War]] (the Vietnam War), the [[Vietcong]] and [[North Vietnam]] used eastern Cambodia as a base area for operations against [[South Vietnam]]. This included the transit of supplies from Cambodian ports and overland supplies from the north. The [[United States]]  bombed the border of [[South Vietnam]] and Cambodia, targeting [[Vietcong]] camps and supply routes. The more pressure the US put on the Viet Cong, the further west into Cambodia their bases moved. The government of Prince Sihanouk, in the name of "neutrality" simultanously ignored both the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia and the American bombing campaign against Cambodia. The Vietnamese also provided safe areas for the Khmer Rouge organization within areas under their military control and offered them military supplies. In 1970, while Prince Sihanouk was away in [[Beijing]], General [[Lon Nol]] seized power with U.S. approval in a military ''[[coup d'état]]'' and declared the establishment of the [[Khmer Republic]]. This immediately led to [[civil war]]. Prince Sihanouk, with no forces of his own, lent his name to the xenophobic and [[maoist]] Khmer Rouge under [[Pol Pot]]. The Khmer Rouge were strongly supported by the communist Chinese, North Vietnamese and the [[Vietcong]]. They went on to capture the capital Phnom Penh in 1975, and later renamed the country [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. The tactics of the Khmer Rouge included:

* closing schools and hospitals
* abolishing banking and currency
* outlawing religion
* confiscating private property
* forceably relocating entire populations from cities and urban areas to the countryside, where people were [[unfree labor|forced to work]] on [[collective farming|collective farms]]

Although the Khmer Rouge sought to justify its actions by claiming that Cambodia was on the brink of major famine due to the U.S. bombing campaigns, and that self-sufficiency required the evacuation of the cities, such claims are mainly seen as excuses and are not widely supported. The evacuations had the effect of converting the entire country into an immense [[re-education]]/[[labor camp]]. During the rule of the Khmer Rouge, about 1.7 million people were killed, about 20% to 30% of the country's population immediately prior to the Khmer Rouge regime. The [[Killing Fields]] and the [[S-21]] prison, also known as Tuol Sleng, shocked the entire world as examples of the Khmer Rouge's brutal [[autogenocide]]. In addition to death from work, starvation and exhaustion, the regime killed anyone suspected with connections with either the defeated Khmer Republic government or the previous Sihanouk government, as well as intellectuals (Pol Pot defined anyone who wore glasses as automatically an intellectual), professionals, and also ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Chinese race|Chinese]], [[Chams]], [[Laotian]]s, and [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]]. Cambodia broke into [[Vietnam]]ese, [[Laos|Lao]], and [[Thailand|Thai]] territory and massacred entire villages of border provinces. Even the royal family was brutalized. Prince Sihanouk was put under house arrest and many of the Sisowath branch of the family were massacred. The [[Tuol Sleng]] museum is a good authority on this period.

In 1978, a newly-unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia after repeated Khmer Rouge raids into Vietnamese territory and drove the Khmer Rouge to the western border with Thailand. Vietnam helped establish the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], under the rule of the pro-Vietnamese communist [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]] (renamed [[Cambodian People's Party]] in 1991), seen by most of the world as a [[puppet state]].

=== Recent years ===

Civil war between the new government and the Khmer Rouge continued for several years until negotiations in Paris led to Vietnam's withdrawal in late [[1989]]. In 1993 a [[United Nations]] transitional authority sponsored democratic elections, with a very high turnout of eligible voters. However, the popular results were negated, and government was instead formed by a regime with Prince Sihanouk as king and Hun Sen as prime minister.

In 1998 a coalition government between the conservative-royalist [[Funcinpec]] party and the Cambodian People's Party was formed, and also saw the surrender of the remaining Khmer Rouge troops and the death of [[Pol Pot]]. However, many international observers have remained concerned with the endemic corruption and culture of impunity that continues under Hun Sen’s CPP. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4183606.stm][http://www.hrw.org/wr2k2/asia3.html][http://www.ahrchk.net/pub/mainfile.php/cambodia_judiciary/117/]

After decades of horror, Cambodia is still struggling to rebuild itself and come to terms with the ravages of the Khmer Rouge, the leaders of which have never been tried for their [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. However, a handful of top Khmer Rouge leaders are finally expected to face trial for crimes under Cambodian and international law later in 2006. Some trials have already occurred; however, it is suspected that at least one judge, Sok Setha Mony, who was involved in the sentencing of Khmer Rouge official Sam Bith and the trial of several self-proclaimed "Freedom Fighters", might have been killed over his decision.[http://www.licadho.org/press/files/29APRIL%2023%202003-%20Sok%20Sethamony%20on%20website.pdf]

== Politics ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Cambodia]]''


Cambodia underwent turbulent events from the 1970s until the early 1990s, when elections, administered by the United Nations, were held. Ever since then, Cambodia has enjoyed greater stability and peace. One effect of this was the smooth transition when King Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his son [[Norodom Sihamoni]] on [[October 14]], [[2004]].

Cambodia is now a [[constitutional monarchy]] where executive power is held by the [[prime minister]]. The head of the state is the king, who reigns but does not govern. Although in the [[Khmer language]] there are many words meaning "king", the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is ''preahmâhaksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[دوتنه:Seihamuni11.png|80px]]), which literally means: ''preah''- ("sacred", cognate of the Indian word [[Brahmin]]) -''mâha''- (from [[Sanskrit]], meaning "great", cognate with "maha-" in [[maharaja]]) -''ksat'' ("warrior, ruler", cognate of the Indian word [[Kshatriya]]).

On the occasion of HM King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in October 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king: ''preahmâhaviraksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[دوتنه:Sihanouk6.png|90px]]), where ''vira'' comes from Sanskrit ''{{IPA|vīra}}'', meaning "brave or eminent man, hero, chief", cognate of [[Latin]] ''vir'', ''viris'', [[English language|English]] ''virile''. ''Preahmâhaviraksat'' is translated into English as "King-Father" ([[French language|French]]: ''Roi-Père''), although the word "father" does not appear in the Khmer noun.

As ''preahmâhaviraksat'', Norodom Sihanouk retains many of the prerogatives he formerly held as ''preahmâhaksat'' and is a highly respected and listened-to figure. Thus, in effect, Cambodia can be described as a country with two heads of state: an official one, the ''preahmâhaksat'' Norodom Sihamoni, and an unofficial one, the ''preahmâhaviraksat'' Norodom Sihanouk.

The [[legislature]] comprises a 61-member appointed [[Senate]] and a 123-member [[lower house]], the National Assembly, elected under [[proportional representation]] by popular vote for 5 year terms. The [[judiciary]] is very weak, since only a handful of lawyers and judges were left alive, the rest being killed during the rule of the Khmer Rouge.

[[Hun Sen]] of the [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP), then second prime minister, ousted the then first prime minister Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], son of Prince Sihanouk and brother of current King Sihamoni, in a July, 1997 [[Coup d'état|coup]], where several FUNCINPEC officials were killed. [http://cambodia.ohchr.org/Documents/Statements%20and%20Speeches/English/40.pdf][http://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/cambodia/Cambodia-03.htm]

The CPP came out on top during the 1998 elections, and formed a coalition with FUNCINPEC, Ranariddh's royalist party, but with Hun Sen as sole prime minister. 

In the 2003 National Assembly elections, the CPP won 73 seats with 47% of the vote, the opposition party, the [[Sam Rainsy Party]], won 24 seats (22%), and FUNCINPEC won 26 seats (21%). Eleven women were among those elected. Following a year long deadlock during which FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party united to oppose the CPP, and thus prevented it from forming a government, FUNCINPEC switched sides and joined with the CPP, allowing it to control the two thirds of the seats in the National Assembly needed to form a government.

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Cambodia]]''
[[دوتنه:Phnom_Penh_Climate.png|right|thumb|400px|Climate of Phnom Penh]]

Cambodia has an area of about 181,040 [[square kilometer]]s (69,900&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), sharing an 800&nbsp;[[kilometer]] (500&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) border with [[Thailand]] on the north and west, a 541&nbsp;kilometer (336&nbsp;mi) border with [[Laos]] on the northeast, and a 1,228&nbsp;kilometer (763&nbsp;mi) border with [[Vietnam]] on the east and southeast. It has 443&nbsp;kilometers (275&nbsp;mi) of coastline along the [[Gulf of Thailand]].

The most distinctive geographical feature is the [[lacustrine plain]] formed by the inundations of the [[Tonle Sap]] (Great Lake), measuring about 2,590 square kilometers (1,000&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometers (9,500&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia. Most (about 75 percent) of the country lies at elevations of less than 100 [[meter]]s (330&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level, the exceptions being the [[Cardamom Mountains]] (highest elevation 1,813&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;5,948&nbsp;ft) and their southeast extension the [[Dâmrei Mountains]] ("Elephant Mountains") (elevation range 500-1,000&nbsp;m or 1,640–3,280&nbsp;ft), as well the steep escarpment of the [[Dângrêk Mountains]] (average elevation 500&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;1,640&nbsp;ft) along the border with Thailand's [[Isan]] region. The highest elevation of Cambodia is [[Phnom Aoral]], near [[Pursat]] in the center of the country, at 1,813 meters (5,948 feet) above sea-level.

Temperatures range from 10°[[Celsius|C]] to 38&nbsp;°C (50°[[Fahrenheit|F]]–100°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and Cambodia experiences tropical [[monsoon]]s. Southwest monsoons blowing inland bring moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and [[Indian Ocean]] from May to October, and the country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to March, with the driest period from January to February.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Cambodia]]''

Despite the recent progress, the Cambodian economy continues to suffer from the effects of decades of [[civil war]] and internal strife. The [[per capita income]], is rapidly increasing, but is low compared with other countries in the region. Most rural households depend on [[agriculture]] and its related sub-sectors. [[Rice]], [[fish]], [[timber]], [[garments]] and [[rubber]] are Cambodia's major exports, and the [[United States]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] are its major export partners.

The recovery of Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-1998 due to the [[Asian financial crisis|regional economic crisis]], civil violence, and political infighting. [[Foreign Direct Investment|Foreign investment]] and [[tourism]] also fell off drastically. Since then however, growth has been steady. In 1999, the first full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and [[economic growth|growth]] resumed at 5.0%. Despite severe flooding, GDP grew at 5.0% in 2000, 6.3% in 2001, and 5.2% in 2002. [[Tourism]] was Cambodia's fastest growing industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to 1,055,000 in 2004. During 2003 and 2004 the growth rate remained steady at 5.0%, while in 2004 inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion [[United States Dollar|US dollars]]. As of 2004 [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per Capita was $1900 [[USD]], which ranked it 175th (out of 232) countries [http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html].

The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of basic [[infrastructure]]. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid. The government is addressing these issues with assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Cambodia]]''
[[دوتنه:Cambodia-demography.png|thumb|300px|Number of inhabitants between 1961 and 2001 in thousands. Note the decrease during the Khmer Rouge years (1975-1979). FAO Data,Cambodia]]

Cambodia is ethnically homogeneous, as more than 90% of its population is of [[Khmer people|Khmer]] origin and speaks the [[Khmer language]], the country's official language. The remainder include [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]], Vietnamese, [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Khmer Loeu]]. 

The Khmer language is a member of the [[Mon-Khmer]] subfamily of the [[Austroasiatic language]] group. [[French language|French]] is spoken by many Cambodians as a second-language and is often the language of instruction in various schools and universities. [[Cambodian French]] is a  dialect found in Cambodia. It is also frequently used in government. However, in recent decades, many younger Cambodians, as well as members of the business-classes, have favored learning [[English language|English]] and it is gradually becoming more widely-known.

[[Theravada Buddhism]], suppressed by Khmer Rouge but now revived, is the main religion, but [[Christianity]] is spreading in the country.

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Cambodia]]''
[[دوتنه:Srokkmae.png|thumb|150px|right|"Cambodia" in [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer writing]]]]

Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the [[Khmer empire]], has distinctive styles of dance, architecture and sculpture which have strongly influenced neighbouring [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]]. Notable recent artistic figures include the singers [[Sinn Sisamouth]], who introduced new musical styles to the country, and later [[Meng Keo Pichenda]].

Bonn Om Teuk (Water Festival), the annual boat rowing contest, is the biggest Cambodian holiday. The festival is held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong river begins to sink back to its normal levels. Approximately 10% of Cambodia's population attends this event each year. Popular games include kicking a ''sey,'' which is similar to a [[hacky sack]], [[cockfighting]] and [[soccer]]. 

Rice, as in other South East Asian countries, is the staple grain, while fish from the Mekong and Tonle Sap also form an important part of the diet. The Cambodian per capita supply of fish and fish products for food and trade in 2000 was 20 [[kilogram]]s of fish per year or 2&nbsp;[[avoirdupois|ounces]] per day per person. [http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/Coa_cou_116.pdf]. Some of the fish can be made into [[prahok]] (a Khmer delicacy) for longer storage. Overall, the [[cuisine of Cambodia]] is similar to that of its [[Southeast Asia]]n neighbours. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbors [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], but has been described not as spicy as [[Thai cuisine]] and similar to other Southeast Asia cuisines.
 
Customary Cambodian teachings include: that if a person does not wake up before sunrise he is lazy; you have to tell your parents or elders where you are going and what time you are coming back home; close doors gently, otherwise you have a bad temper; sit with your legs straight down and not crossed (crossing your legs shows that you are an impolite person); and always let other people talk more than you.

Khmer culture is very hierarchical, in that the greater a person's age, the greater the level of respect that must be granted to them. Everyone in Khmer culture is given a hierarchial title before the name, in some cases names are shorten with the title added before the name is given; varies in relation to the person. In some cases elders are refered to by a family title even though there is no relation, out of respect to there seniority in life. Referring to someone by the improper title is a sign of disrespect and would be assumed as improper parenting or a lack of respect for elders.

== Transportation ==
''Main article: [[Transportation in Cambodia]]''
[[دوتنه:Khmer Transport.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Motorbike]] riders in Phnom Penh]]

The civil war severely damaged the transportation system, despite the provision of [[USSR|Soviet]] technical assistance and equipment.
Cambodia has two rail lines, totaling about 612 kilometers (380&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of single, one&nbsp;[[meter]]&nbsp;gauge track. The lines run from the capital to [[Sihanoukville]] on the southern coast, and from Phnom Penh to [[Sisophon]] (although trains often run only as far as [[Battambang]]).

The nation's extensive inland waterways were important historically in domestic trade. The [[Mekong]] and the [[Tonle Sap]] River, their numerous tributaries, and the [[Tonle Sap]] provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers (2,300&nbsp;mi) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters (2&nbsp;ft) and another 282 kilometers (175&nbsp;mi) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters (6&nbsp;ft). Cambodia has two major ports, [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Sihanoukville]], and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, located at the junction of the [[Basak River|Basak]], the [[Mekong]], and the [[Tonle Sap]] rivers, is the only [[river port]] capable of receiving 8,000&nbsp;[[ton]] ships during the wet season and 5,000&nbsp;[[ton]] ships during the dry season.

The country possesses six commercial [[airport]]s: [[Pochentong International Airport]] near Phnom Penh is the largest, while the others are at [[Siem Reap]], [[Battambang]], [[Mondulkiri]], [[Ratanakiri]], and [[Stung Treng]].

The locals normally use [[automobile]]s, [[motorbike]]s and [[bus]]es. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s ("cyclos") are an additional option often used by visitors.

== Foreign relations ==
''Main article: [[Foreign relations of Cambodia]]''

Cambodia has [[diplomatic relations]] with most countries and is a member of most major international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] and its specialized agencies such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. Cambodia is an [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) member, a member of [[ASEAN]], and joined the [[WTO]] on [[13 October]] [[2004]].  In 2005 Cambodia attended the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]].

The country has several [[border dispute]]s with its neighbours, including disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with [[Vietnam]], and undefined maritime boundaries and border areas with [[Thailand]].

In [[January 2003]], there were [[2003 Phnom Penh riots|riots in Phnom Penh]] prompted by rumored comments about [[Angkor Wat]] by a Thai actress wrongly attributed by Reaksmei Angkor, a Cambodian newspaper, and later quoted by Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]][http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rpt/20565.htm]: the Thai government sent military aircraft to evacuate Thai nationals and closed its border with Cambodia, while Thais demonstrated outside the Cambodian embassy in [[Bangkok]]. The border was re-opened on [[March 21]], after the Cambodian government paid $6 million [[USD]] in compensation for the destruction of the Thai embassy and agreed to compensate individual Thai businesses for their losses.

== Tourism ==
[[دوتنه:AngkorReflect.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Angkor Wat]], the biggest tourist draw of Cambodia]]

The tourism industry is the country's second-greatest source of [[hard currency]] after the [[textile]] industry [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2732.htm].  More than 60% of visitor arrivals are to [[Angkor]], and most of the remainder to [[Phnom Penh]] [http://www.mot.gov.kh/statistic.asp]. Other tourist hotspots include [[Sihanoukville]] (Cambodia's only port), which has a popular beach, and the area around Kampot including the [[Bokor Hill Station]].

The [[Angkor Wat]] temple complex is the best preserved example of Khmer architecture. ''Angkor'' means "city" and ''Wat'' "temple". Out of bounds to tourists during the civil war, it gained particular worldwide attention after featuring in the 2001 movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. The [[Bayon]], also at Angkor, is located at the center of [[Angkor Thom]]. It has 54 towers, each bearing four smiling faces.

Many tourists also visit the [[S-21|Tuol Sleng Museum]], the infamous prison of the Khmer Rouge, and [[Choeung Ek]], one of the main [[The Killing Fields|Killing Fields]]; both display photographs, skulls and bones of victims of the autogenocide. Cambodia is also a major destination for [[sex tourism]], and there is particular concern over child sex and [[sexual slavery|forced prostitution]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/943446.stm].

<small>
#A figure of three million deaths between 1975 and 1979 was given by the Vietnamese-sponsored Phnom Penh regime, the PRK. Father Ponchaud suggested 2.3 million; the [[Yale University|Yale]] [http://www.yale.edu/cgp/ Cambodian autogenocide Project] estimates 1.7 million; [[Amnesty International]] estimated 1.4 million ; and the [[United States Department of State]], 1.2 million. Khieu Samphan and Pol Pot, who could be expected to give underestimations, cited figures of 1 million and 800,000, respectively.
