'''Senegal''', officially the '''Republic of Senegal''', is a country south of the [[Sénégal River]] in [[West Africa|western Africa]]. Senegal is bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, [[ماوريتانيا]] to the north, [[مالي]] to the east, and [[ګونې]] and [[ګوينې بېساو]] to the south. [[ګامبيا]] lies almost entirely within Senegal, surrounded on the north, east and south; from its western coast, The Gambia's territory follows the [[Gambia River]] more than 300 km inland. The [[Cape Verde]] islands lie some 560 km (348 miles) off the Senegalese [[coast]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Senegal}}

Archaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times. [[Islam]], the dominant religion in Senegal, first came to the region in the [[11th century]].  Today, 95 percent of Senegalese are Muslims. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the [[Mandingo]] empires to the east; the [[Jolof Empire]] of Senegal also was founded during this time.  Various [[Europe]]an powers came to the area from the [[15th century]] onward, until [[France]] ended up in possession of what had become an important [[slave trade]] departure point. Independence from [[France]] was gained in 1960, on April 4th.

In January 1959, Senegal and the [[French Sudan]] merged to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent on [[June 20]] [[1960]], as a result of the independence and the transfer of power agreement signed with [[France]] on [[April 4]] [[1960]]. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on [[August 20]]. Senegal and Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) proclaimed independence. [[Léopold Senghor]] was elected Senegal's first president in August 1960.

After the breakup of the Mali Federation, President Senghor and Prime Minister [[Mamadou Dia]] governed together under a parliamentary system. In December 1962, their political rivalry led to an attempted coup by Prime Minister Dia. Although this was put down without bloodshed, Dia was arrested and imprisoned, and Senegal adopted a new constitution that consolidated the president's power. In 1980, President Senghor decided to retire from politics, and he handed power over in 1981 to his handpicked successor, [[Abdou Diouf]]. 

Senegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal confederation of [[Senegambia]] on [[February 1]] [[1982]]. However, the union was dissolved in [[1989]]. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982. Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping.

Abdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the [[Casamance]]. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Diouf served four terms as president. In the presidential election of 2000, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed as free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. 

On [[December 30]] [[2004]] President [[Abdoulaye Wade]] announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the [[Casamance]] region.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Senegal}}

Senegal is a republic with a powerful presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every seven years, amended in 2001 to every five years, by universal adult [[suffrage]]. The current president is [[Abdoulaye Wade]].

Senegal also has 65 [[political party|political parties]] which contribute to development of the country through working towards a successful transition to democracy in the country, and even among other developing countries on the African continent. The unicameral [[National Assembly of Senegal|National Assembly]] has 120 members elected separately from the president. A single house legislature, and a fair and independent judiciary also exist in Senegal. The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council, and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.

Senegal has a reputation for transparency in government operations. The level of economic [[political corruption|corruption]] that has damaged the development of the economies in other parts of the world is very low. Today Senegal has a democratic political culture, being part of one of the most successful democratic transitions in Africa.

Local administrators are all appointed by and responsible to the president. Senegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal confederation of [[Senegambia]] in [[1982]]. However, the envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union was dissolved in [[1989]]. Despite peace talks, a separatist group in the southern [[Casamance]] region has sporadically clashed with government forces since 1982. Senegal has a long history of participating in international [[UN peacekeeping|peacekeeping]].

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Sg-map.png|framed|Map of Senegal|بټنوک]]
{{main|Geography of Senegal}}

Senegal is located on the west of the African continent. The Senegalese landscape consists mainly of the rolling sandy plains of the western [[Sahel]] which rise to foothills in the southeast. Here is also found Senegal's highest point, an otherwise unnamed feature near [[Nepen Diakha]] at 581 m. The northern border is formed by the [[Senegal River]], other rivers include the [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Casamance River]]s. The capital [[Dakar]] lies on the [[Cap-Vert]] peninsula, the westernmost point of continental [[Africa]].

[[دوتنه:Senegal2.jpg|220px|کيڼ|بټنوک|Homes in the countryside]]
The local [[climate]] is [[tropical climate|tropical]] with well-defined dry and humid seasons that result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds. Dakar's annual [[rainfall]] of about 600mm (24 in) occurs between June and October when maximum temperatures average 27&nbsp;°C (80.6&nbsp;°F); December to February minimum temperatures are about 17&nbsp;°C (62.6&nbsp;°F). Interior temperatures are higher than along the coast, and rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding 1.5m (59.1 in) annually in some areas.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Senegal}}

[[دوتنه:SenegalStreet.jpg|300px|ښي|بټنوک|Street vendors]]

In January [[1994]], Senegal undertook a bold and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international donor community. This reform began with a 50 percent devaluation of Senegal's currency, the [[CFAF|CFA franc]], which was linked at a fixed rate to the former French [[franc]] and now to the [[euro]]. Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy contract by 2.1% in [[1993]], Senegal made an important turnaround, thanks to the reform programme, with real growth in [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] averaging 5 % annually during [[1995]]-[[2001]]. Annual [[inflation]] had been pushed down to less than 1%, but rose to an estimated 3.3% in 2001. Investment rose steadily from 13.8% of GDP in 1993 to 16.5% in [[1997]].

As a member of the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU), Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external [[tariff]]. Senegal also realised full [[Internet]] connectivity in [[1996]], creating a miniboom in [[information technology]]-based services. Private activity now accounts for 82% of GDP. On the negative side, Senegal faces deep-seated urban problems of chronic [[unemployment]], [[Income disparity|socioeconomic disparity]], [[juvenile delinquency]], and [[drug addiction]] -- much as produced within hierarchically class-based populations in the developed/industrialized world's urban environs.

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:Senegal-demography.png|بټنوک|ښي|Senegal's population 1961-2003]]
{{main|Demographics of Senegal}}

Senegal has a population of some 11 million, about 70 percent of whom live in rural areas. Density in these areas varies from about 77[[square metre|km²]] in the west-central region to 2 km² in the arid eastern section.

=== Ethnicity ===
{{main|Ethnic groups in Senegal}}

Senegal has a [[Indigenous cultures, kingdoms and ethnic groups of Senegal|wide variety of ethnic groups]] and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken. The [[Wolof people|Wolof]] are the largest single ethnic group in Senegal at 43%; the [[Serer]] (15%) are the second biggest group, followed by others that include the [[Fula]] (24%), [[Lebou]] (10%), [[Jola people|Jola]] (4%), [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] (3%), [[Toucouleur]], [[Soninke]], [[Bassari]] and many smaller communities. About 50,000 [[Europe]]ans (mostly [[France|French]]) as well as smaller numbers of [[Mauritanians]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] reside in Senegal, mainly in the cities. Also located primarily in urban settings are the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] communities. From the time of earliest contact between Europeans and Africans along the coast of Senegal, particularly after the establishment of coastal trading posts during the fifteenth century, communities of mixed African and European (mostly French and [[Portugal|Portuguese]]) origin have thrived. [[Cape Verde]]ans living in urban areas and in the [[Casamance]] region represent another recognized community of mixed African and European background.  [[French language|French]] is the official language, used regularly by a minority of Senegalese educated in a system styled upon the colonial-era schools of French origin (Koranic schools are even more popular, but Arabic is not widely spoken outside of this context of recitation). Most people also speak their own ethnic language while, especially in Dakar, [[Wolof]] is the Lingua Franca. [[Portuguese Creole]] is a prominent minority language in Ziguinchor, regional capital of the [[Casamance]], where some residents speak [[Kriol]], primarily spoken in [[Guinea-Bissau]]. Cape Verdeans speak their native creole.

=== Religion ===

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion, practiced by approximately 94 percent of the country's population; the [[Christianity|Christian]] community, at 4 percent of the population, includes [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and diverse [[Protestant]] denominations.

==== Islam ====
[[دوتنه:Senegal Grande Mosquee de Ouakam 800x600.jpg|بټنوک|Grande Mosquee de Ouakam, Senegal]]

''Main article: [[Islam in Senegal]]''

Islamic communities are generally organized around one of several Islamic [[Sufi]] orders or brotherhoods, headed by a ''[[khalif]]'' (''xaliifa'' in [[Wolof language|Wolof]], from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''khalīfa''), who is usually a direct descendant of the group’s founder. The two largest and most prominent Sufi orders in Senegal are the [[Tijaniyya]], whose largest sub-groups are based in the cities of [[Tivaouane]] and [[Kaolack]], and the [[Murid|Murīdiyya (Murid)]], based in the city of [[Touba, Senegal|Touba]]. The [[Halpulaar]], a widespread ethnic group found along the Sahel from Chad to Senegal, representing 20 percent of the Senegalese population, were the first to be converted to Islam. The Halpulaar, composed of various [[Fula people]] groups, named ''Peuls'' and ''[[Toucouleur]]s'' in Senegal.  Many of the ''Toucouleurs'', or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal.  Most communities south of the Senegal River Valley, however, were not thoroughly Islamized until the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  During the mid-nineteenth century, Islam became a banner of resistance against the traditional aristocracies and French colonialism, and Tijānī leaders [[Al-Hajj Umar Tall]] and [[Màbba Jaxu Ba]] established short-lived but influential Islamic states but were both killed in battle and their empires than annexed by the French.

The spread of formal Quranic school (called ''daara'' in Wolof) during the colonial period increased largely through the effort of the Tijaniyya.  In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older [[Qadiriyya|Qādiriyya]] order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu.  Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can.  Some of them continue their religious studies at informal Arabic schools (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.

==== Christianity ====

Small Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal [[Serer]], [[Jola people|Jola]] and [[Balant]] populations, and in Oriental Senegal among the [[Bassari]] and [[Coniagui]]. In [[Dakar]], Catholic and Protestant rites are also practiced by a portion of the Lebanese, Capeverdian, European, and American immigrant population, and among certain Africans of other countries.  Although Islam is Senegal's majority religion, Senegal's first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a Catholic Serer.

==== Other Religions ====
Other religions in Senegal are mostly [[Animism]], followed by [[Judaism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Judaism is followed by any people beyond racial lines and Buddhism is followed by a number of Chinese and Vietnamese.
