The families were accompanied by servants and slaves, some of whom were [[Celt]]s or [[Picts]] from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] (known as ''[[Westmen]]'' to the [[Norsemen|Norse]]). Some literary evidence suggests that [[Papar]] (Irish monks) may have been living in Iceland before the arrival of Norse settlers, but no archaeological evidence has been found.

[[Erik the Red]], or Eiríkur rauði, was exiled from Iceland for [[manslaughter]] in 980, and set sail to explore the lands to the west. He established the first settlements in [[Greenland]] around this time, naming the land, according to legend, to attract settlers. Eirikur's son, [[Leif Ericson]] (Leifur Eiríksson), finally set foot in the Americas around the year [[1000]]. While some say he was blown off-course, it is most likely that he was deliberately seeking the land spotted by [[Bjarni Herjólfsson]] several years earlier. He is believed to have established a colony at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]], which lasted only a few years. Despite the short stay, a sizable colony with at least eight buildings including a [[forge]] and various [[workshop]]s was built. Two further attempts at colonization by his brother ended in failure.

The {{lang|is|Alþingi}} ({{lang-en|[[Althing]]}}, literally ''all-[[thing (assembly)|thing]] (Þing in icelandic means parliament)'' or general assembly) was founded in 930, marking the beginning of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]]. It was the predecessor to the modern Icelandic legislature. The Althing is the oldest still-standing, parliament in the world that has written documents to prove its age. 

Iceland was a free state, without a king, until the end of the [[Sturlungaöld]] civil war in 1262, when it established a [[personal union]] with the [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] with ''{{lang|is|[[Gamli sáttmáli]]}}'' ({{lang-en|The Old Covenant}}). From 1387 on, Iceland was in practice ruled by [[Denmark]], following the union of the two kingdoms. When that union was dissolved in 1814, through the [[Treaty of Kiel]], which saw Norway entering a union with [[Sweden]], Iceland became a dominion of Denmark [[colony]]. <ref name="CIA Intro"> [[Home rule]] was granted by the Danish government in 1904, and independence followed in 1918. <ref name="CIA Intro"> From 1918 on, Iceland was in a personal union with the Danish king, with foreign relations being carried out by the king, as instructed by the Icelandic government until the [[World War II]] military occupation of Denmark by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940. Subsequently, Iceland was occupied by the [[Allies]]. The [[Christian X of Denmark|Danish King]] remained the ''{{lang|la|de jure}}'' sovereign of the nation until 1944, when the current [[republic]] was founded after the 1918 treaty had lapsed.

The new republic became a charter member of [[NATO]] in 1949 and signed a treaty with the [[United States]] in 1951 to take responsibility for the defense of Iceland. [[As of 2006]], the U.S. is significantly reducing its military presence on the base in [[Keflavík]] <ref>{{cite web

The economy of Iceland remained dependent on fisheries in the post-war decades, and the country has had several clashes with its neighbours over this vital resource, most notably the [[Cod Wars]] with the [[United Kingdom|British]].

{{main|Subdivisions of Iceland}}

Iceland is divided into regions, constituencies, counties, and municipalities.

=== Regions ===
{{main|Regions of Iceland}}
There are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes; the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division. <ref name="CIA Govt"/>

=== Constituencies ===
{{main|Constituencies of Iceland}}
Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliament elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies. The change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country since a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists. <ref name="CIA Govt"/>

=== Counties ===
{{main|Counties of Iceland}}
Iceland's 23 counties are for the most part historical divisions. Currently, Iceland is split up among 26 magistrates that represent government in various capacities. Among their duties are running the local police (except in Reykjavík, where there is a special office of police commissioner), tax collection, administering bankruptcy declarations, and performing nonreligious weddings. <ref name="CIA Govt"/>

=== Municipalities ===
{{main|Municipalities of Iceland}}
There are 79 municipalities in Iceland which govern most local matters like schools, transportation and zoning. <ref name="CIA Govt"/> <br />

:''Main articles: [[Geography of Iceland]] and [[List of settlements in Iceland]].''

Iceland is located in the North Atlantic Ocean just south of the [[Arctic Circle]], which passes through the small island of [[Grímsey]] off Iceland's northern coast, but not through mainland Iceland. Unlike neighbouring [[Greenland]], Iceland is considered to be a part of [[Europe]], not a part of [[The Americas|North America]]. Due to cultural, economic and linguistic similarities, Iceland in many contexts is also included in [[Scandinavia]]. It is the [[List of islands by size|world's 18th largest island]], and Europe's 2nd largest island following [[Great Britain]].

Approximately 10 percent of the island is glaciated. Many [[fjord]]s punctuate its 3,088 [[mile]]s (4,970&nbsp;km) long coastline, which is also where most towns are situated because the island's interior, the [[Highlands of Iceland]], is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sands and mountains. The major towns are the capital [[Reykjavík]], [[Keflavík]], where the national airport is situated, and [[Akureyri]]. The island of [[Grímsey]] on the [[Arctic Circle]] contains the northernmost habitation of Iceland. <ref name="CIA Geo">{{cite web

The only native land mammal when humans arrived was the [[arctic fox]]. It came to the island at the end of the ice age, walking over the frozen sea. There are no native reptiles or amphibians on the island. There are around 1,300 known species of [[insects]] in Iceland (ca. 1,100 of them [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]]), which is rather low compared with other countries (there are about 925,000 known species in the world). During the last [[Ice Age]] almost all of the country was covered by permanent snow and glacier ice. This explains the low number of living species in Iceland.

When humans arrived, [[birch]] forest and woodland probably covered 25-40% of Iceland’s land area. But soon the settlers started to remove the trees and forests to create fields and grazing land. During the early 20th century the forests were at their minimum and were almost wiped out of existence. The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees since, but this can not be compared with the original forests. Some of those planted forests have included new foreign species.

Iceland has four national parks: [[Jökulsárgljúfur National Park]], [[Skaftafell National Park]], [[Snæfellsjökull National Park]], and [[Þingvellir|Þingvellir National Park]].

Iceland is located on both a geological [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]], thought to be caused by a [[mantle plume]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. This combined location means that the island is extremely geologically active, having many [[volcano]]es, notably [[Hekla]], [[Eldgjá]], and [[Eldfell]]. The volcanic eruption of [[Laki]] in [[1783]]-[[1784]] caused much loss of life and even affected Europe. There are also [[geyser]]s (a word derived from the name of one in Iceland, [[Geysir]]). With this widespread availability of [[geothermal power]], and also because of the numerous rivers and waterfalls that are harnessed for hydropower, residents of most towns have hot water and home heat for a low price. The island itself is composed primarily of [[basalt]], or cooled [[lava]]. 

Iceland controls [[Surtsey]], one of the youngest islands in the world. It rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between November 8, 1963 and June 5, 1967. <ref name="CIA Geo"/>

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Iceland}}

The original population of Iceland was of Nordic and Celtic origin. This is evident by literary evidence from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as [[blood type]] and [[genetics|genetic]] analysis. One such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Celtic origin. The modern population of Iceland is often described as a "homogeneous mixture of descendants of Norse and Celts" but several history scholars reject the alleged homogeneity as a myth that fails to take into account the fact that Iceland was never isolated from the rest of Europe and actually has had a lot of contact with traders and fishermen from many nations through the ages.

Iceland has extensive genealogical records about its population dating back to the age of settlement. Although the accuracy of these records is debated, biopharmaceutical companies such as [[deCODE Genetics]] see them as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases.

The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ashfall from volcanic eruptions, and plagues adversely affected the population several times. The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population of the island was then 50,358. Improving living conditions triggered a rapid increase in population from the mid-19th century to the present day - from about 60,000 in 1850 to 300,000 in 2006.

In 2004, 20,669 people (7% of the total population) who were living in Iceland had been born abroad, including children of Icelandic parents living abroad. 10,636 people (3.6% of the total population) had foreign citizenship. The most populous nationalities are [[Poland|Polish]] (1903), [[Denmark|Danish]] (890), [[Yugoslavia|ex-Yugoslavians]] (670), [[Philippines|Filipinos]] (647) and [[Germany|Germans]] (540).

The island's spoken language is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language. In terms of etymology, the [[Icelandic language]] is the closest to [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], the language of the [[Viking]]s. Experts claim them to be virtually identical even though the Viking civilization disappeared about 800 years ago. Today, the closest language still in existence to Icelandic is [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. In education, the use of [[Icelandic Sign Language]] for the Deaf in Iceland is [[recognition of sign languages|regulated]] by the ''National Curriculum Guide''. The predominant religion is [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]].

Prominent foreign languages include [[English language|English]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and other Scandinavian languages and [[German language|German]], though [[Polish language|Polish]] is becoming more important.

The southwest corner of Iceland is the most densely populated region and the location of the capital Reykjavík, the northernmost capital in the world. The largest towns outside the capital region are [[Akureyri]] and [[Reykjanesbær]].

{{main|Politics of Iceland}}
[[دوتنه:ogrimsson.jpg|thumb|135px|right|[[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], President of Iceland.]]
[[دوتنه:Ghaarde.jpg|thumb|135px|left|[[Geir Haarde]], Prime Minister of Iceland.]]

The modern parliament, called "[[Althing]]" or "Alþingi", was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[monarch|king]]. It was widely seen as a reestablishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period and suspended in 1799. It currently has 63 members, each of whom is elected by the population every four years. The [[president of Iceland]] is a largely ceremonial office that serves as a [[diplomat]], figurehead and [[head of state]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[prime minister]], who, together with the cabinet, takes care of the [[executive]] part of [[government]]. The cabinet is appointed by the president after general elections to Althing; however, this process is usually conducted by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed (under the condition that it has a majority support in Althing). Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves in reasonable time does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet himself. This has never happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 the regent of the country ([[Sveinn Björnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941) did appoint a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Björnsson in fact became the country's first president in 1944. The governments of Iceland have almost always been coalitions with two or more parties involved, due to the fact that no single political party has received a majority of seats in Althing in the republic period. The extent of the political powers possessed by the office of the president are disputed by legal scholars in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.

Elections for the office of presidency, parliament and in town councils are all held every four years, last held in 2004, 2003 and 2006, respectively.

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|Economy of Iceland}}

Iceland is the 5th richest country in the world based on [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] at [[purchasing power parity]]. It is also ranked number two on the 2005 [[United Nations Human Development Index]]. The [[economics|economy]] historically depended heavily on the [[fishing]] industry, which still provides almost 40% of export earnings and employs 8% of the work force. In the absence of other [[natural resources]] (except for abundant [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] and [[geothermal power]]), Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world [[fish]] prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, [[aluminium]], and [[ferrosilicon]]. Although the Icelandic economy still relies heavily on fishing it is constantly becoming less important as the travel industry and other service, technology, energy intensive and various other industries grow. <ref name="CIA Economy"/>

The centre-right government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatising state-owned industries. The government remains opposed to [[EU]] membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing resources.

Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, and new developments in [[software]] production, [[biotechnology]], and financial services are taking place. The [[tourism]] sector is also expanding, with the recent trends in [[ecotourism]] and [[whale]]-watching. Growth slowed between 2000 and 2002, but the economy expanded by 4.3% in 2003 and grew by 6.2% in 2004. The unemployment rate of 1.8% (3rd quarter of 2005) is among the lowest in the [[European Economic Area]].

Over 99% of the country's electricity is produced from [[hydropower]] and [[geothermal energy]]. <ref name="CIA Economy"/>

Iceland's [[agriculture]] industry consists mainly of [[potato]]es, [[vegetables|green vegetables]], [[mutton]], [[dairy|dairy products]] and [[fish]]. <ref name="CIA Economy"/>

Iceland's stock market, the [[Iceland Stock Exchange]] (ISE), was established in 1985.

== مذهب ==
:''Main article: [[Religion in Iceland]]''

Icelanders enjoy [[freedom of religion]] as stated by the [[constitution of Iceland|constitution]]; however, church and state are not separated and the [[National Church of Iceland]], a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] body, is the [[state church]]. The national registry keeps account of the religious affiliation of every Icelandic citizen and according to it, Icelanders in 2005 divided into religious groups as follows:
* 84.1% members of the National Church of Iceland.
* 4.6% members of the [[Free Lutheran Churches of Reykjavík and Hafnarfjörður]].
* 2.5% not members of any religious group.
* 2.2% members of the [[Catholic Church]], which has a [[Diocese of Reykjavík]].
The remaining 6.5% is mostly divided between a number of other [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations and sects, with less than 1% of the population in non-Christian religious organisations including a tiny group of state-sanctioned indigenous [[Ásatrú]] adherents in the [[Íslenska Ásatrúarfélagið]]. Most Icelanders are either very liberal in their religious beliefs or uninterested in religious matters altogether, and predominantly do not attend church regularly or even at all. <ref name="CIA People">{{cite web

Some famous Icelanders include alternative rock band [[The Sugarcubes]]; its singer [[Björk]]; rap-rock group [[Quarashi]]; artist collective [[GusGus]]; avant-garde rock band [[Sigur Rós]]; folk electronic/acoustic musician [[Emiliana Torrini]] and novelist [[Halldór Laxness]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for literature]] in 1955. Although raised and educated in Scotland, TV presenter [[Magnus Magnusson]] was born in Reykjavík.

Iceland's [[List of countries by literacy rate|literacy rate]] is among the highest in the world, and a love of literature, art, chess, and other intellectual pursuits is widespread. 

An important key to understanding Icelanders and their culture (and which differentiates them from many contemporary [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] peoples) is the high importance they place on the traits of [[independence]] and [[self-reliance]]. Icelanders are proud of their Viking heritage and [[Icelandic language]]. Modern Icelandic remains close to the [[Old Norse]] spoken in the [[Viking Age]].

Icelandic society and culture has a high degree of [[gender equality]], with many women in leadership positions in government and business. Women retain their names after marriage, since Icelanders generally do not use [[surname]]s but [[patronym]]s or (in certain cases) [[matronym]]s. See [[Icelandic name]] for further discussion.

One of the most popular activities in Iceland is visiting the [[geothermal]] [[Balneotherapy|spas]] and pools that can be found all around the country. They are popular with tourists as well.

=== Cuisine ===
Iceland offers wide varieties of traditional cuisine. ''[[Þorramatur]]'' (food of the ''þorri'') is the Icelandic national food. Nowadays ''þorramatur'' is mostly eaten during the ancient [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] month of ''þorri'', in January and February, as a tribute to old culture. ''Þorramatur'' consists of many different types of food, e.g. pickled ram's testicles, putrified shark, scorched sheep heads, scorched sheep's head jam, blood pudding and dried fish (often [[cod]] or [[haddock]]) with butter.
