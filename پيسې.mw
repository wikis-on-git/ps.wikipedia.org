[[Economics]] offers various definitions for '''money''', though it is now commonly defined by the functions attached to any good or token that functions in [[trade]] as a [[medium of exchange]], [[store of value]], and [[unit of account]].  Some authors explicitly require money to be a [[standard of deferred payment]], too [http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=standard%20of%20deferred%20payment].  In common usage, money refers more specifically to  [[currency]], particularly the many [[list of circulating currencies|circulating currencies]] with [[legal tender]] status conferred by a [[nation]]al state;  [[deposit account]]s denominated in such currencies are also considered part of the [[money supply]], although these characteristics are historically comparatively recent.  Money may also serve as a means of rationing access to scarce resources and as a quantitative measure that provides a common standard for the comparison and valuation of quality as well as quantity, such as in the valuation of real estate or artistic works.

The use of money provides an easier alternative to [[barter (economics)|barter]], which is considered in a modern, complex economy to be inefficient because it requires a [[coincidence of wants]] between traders, and an agreement that these needs are of equal value, before a [[transaction]] can occur.  The efficiency gains through the use of money are thought to encourage trade and the division of labour, in turn increasing productivity and [[wealth]]. 

Like language, money is a social organization and civilizing force that provides a means and incentive for human beings to relate to one another economically by exchanging goods and services for mutual benefit. The capacity to convert perishable commodities and non-storable human labor into money provides a powerful incentive for people to produce more than they need for present personal consumption and to convert the surplus value into money so that it can be stored to meet future needs. Thus, the invention of money has stimulated the development of society by fostering hard work, higher productivity and continuous innovation.
In addition to its economic functions and capacities, money has acquired other secondary social and psychological powers that may be exercised either by the expenditure of money or by its mere possession: these include the power to enhance popularity, status and prestige, the capacity to enhance the sense of self-worth, and the power to attain or influence political power.


== History ==
{{Main|History of money}}
A number of [[Commodity money|commodity money systems]] were amongst the earliest forms of money to emerge. For example

* the '''[[shekel]]''' referred to a specific volume of barley in ancient [[Babylon]]
* [[iron]] sticks were used in [[Argos]], before [[Pheidon]]'s reforms.
* '''[[cowrie]]s''' were used as a money in [[ancient China]] and throughout the South Pacific.
* '''[[salt]]''' was used as a currency in pre-coinage societies in Europe.
* ox-shaped ingots of '''[[copper]]''' seem to have functioned as a currency in the [[Bronze Age]] eastern Mediterranean.
* state certified weights of '''[[gold]] and [[silver]]''' have functioned as currency since the reign of [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], if not before.
* '''[[rum]]-currency''' operated in the early European settlement of [[Sydney]] cove in [[Australian history|Australia]].
* '''[[cash crops]]''' such as tobacco, rice, wheat, indigo, and maize were used as money in colonial Virginia.

Under a commodity money system, the objects used as money have [[intrinsic value]], i.e., they have value beyond their use as money.  For example, gold coins retain value because of gold's useful physical properties besides its value due to monetary usage, whereas paper notes are only worth as much as the monetary value assigned to them.  Commodity money is usually adopted to simplify transactions in a barter economy, and so it functions first as a [[medium of exchange]]. It quickly begins functioning as a store of value{{fact}}, since holders of perishable goods can easily convert them into durable money. 

The bulkiness and limited transportability of some forms of commodity money led to the invention of symbolic substitutes for commodity money. Goldsmiths' receipts became an accepted money-substitute for gold in 17th Century England. The goldsmiths were the precursors of leading banks in England and the receipts they issued were the precursors of the banknote. Through most of the 19th Century commercial banks in Europe and North America issued their own banknotes based on the same principle of partial backing.

Many people are under the misimpression that the US dollar and other national currencies were fully convertible into gold prior to abolition of the gold standard in the early 1970s. But through most of the 19th century, gold or silver backing for national currencies was never more than partial and only intended to facilitate international transactions.

From there it was only one further step to create true [[fiat money]], currency that has negligible [[intrinsic value|inherent value]] and is not backed by any commodity. A central authority (government) creates a new money object by issuing paper currency or creating new bank deposits. The widespread acceptance of fiat money is most frequently enhanced by the central authority mandating the money's acceptance as legal tender under penalty of law and demanding this money in payment of taxes or tribute. By the early 1970s almost all countries had abandoned the gold standard and converted their national currencies to pure fiat money.

== Social Evolution of Money ==

{{Main|Social Evolution of money}}

Money is an invention of the human mind. The creation of money is made possible because human beings have the capacity to accord value to symbols. Money is a symbol that represents the value of goods and services. The acceptance of any object as money – be it wampum, a gold coin, a paper currency note or a digital bank account balance – involves the consent of both the individual user and the community. Thus, all money has a psychological and a social as well as an economic dimension. As human consciousness has evolved, the nature and function of money has evolved too. While a history of money may trace the origin and usage of different forms of money at different times and in different parts of the world, an evolutionary perspective on money traces the social and psychological changes in human attitude and collective behavior that made possible this historical development.

== Characteristics ==
Money is generally considered to have the following three characteristics:

'''1. It is a [[medium of exchange]]'''

{{Main|medium of exchange}}

The essential function of money is that of acting as a medium of exchange.

 }}

A '''medium of exchange''' is an intermediary used in [[trade]] to avoid the inconveniences of a pure [[barter (economics)|barter]] system.  

'''2. It is a [[unit of account]]'''

{{Main|unit of account}}

A '''unit of account''' is a standard numerical unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. A unit of account is a necessary pre-requisit for the formulation of comercial agreements that involve debt. 

'''3. It is a [[store of value]]'''

{{Main|store of value}}

To act as a '''store of value''', a [[commodity]], a form of money, or [[financial capital]] must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved - and be predictably useful when it is so retrieved.

== Desirable features ==
To function as money, the monetary item should possess a number of features:

'''To be a [[medium of exchange]]:'''
* It should have [[liquidity]], and be easily [[trade|tradable]], with a low [[Bid/offer spread|spread]] between the prices to buy and sell, in other words, a low [[transaction cost]].
* It should be easily transportable; [[precious metal]]s have a high [[Value (economics)|value]] to weight ratio.  This is why [[petroleum|oil]], [[coal]], [[vermiculite]], or [[water]] are not suitable as money even though they are valuable. Paper notes have proved highly convenient in this regard.
* It should be durable.  Money is often left in pockets through the wash.  Some countries (such as Australia, Mexico and Singapore) are making their bank notes out of plastic for increased durability.  Gold coins are often mixed with copper to improve durability.
* It should minimize contamination and contagion. Since money is frequently handled it becomes a pathway for infectious disease transmission.  Recent studies have shown that the area in business offices that show the highest contamination by disease causing organisms is the accounting office where money must be counted and handled. Unlike paper, silver is used as an anti-bacterial and anti-viral agent, as are platinum and titanium. This property of silver has been recognised for millennia,  which is why silver is often used in eating utensils. 

'''To be a [[unit of account]]:'''
* It should be divisible into small units without destroying its value; precious metals can be coined from bars, or melted down into bars again.  This is why leather and live animals are not suitable as money.
* It should be [[fungible]]: that is, one unit or piece must be exactly equivalent to another, which is why [[diamond]]s, works of [[art]] or [[real estate]] are not suitable as money.
* It must be a specific weight, or measure, or size to be verifiably countable.  For instance, coins are often made with ridges around the edges, so that any removal of material from the coin (lowering its commodity value) will be easy to detect.

'''To be a [[store of value]]:'''
* It should be long lasting and durable; it must not be perishable or subject to decay.  This is why food items, expensive [[spice]]s, or even fine [[silk]]s or oriental [[rug]]s are not generally suitable as money.
* It should have a stable value.
* It should be difficult to [[counterfeit]], and the genuine must be easily recognizable.  

'''To be [[Anonymity|anonymous]]:'''
* In the opinion of all libertarians and most laissez-faire economists, money should not be subject to government tracking.
* In the opinion of all libertarians and most laissez-faire economists, it should be usable for purchases in a [[black market]].
* It should not require equipment, tools or electricity to use.

Money also is typically that which has the least declining [[marginal utility]], meaning that as you accumulate more units of it, each unit is worth about the same as the prior units, and not substantially less.  

For these reasons, [[gold]] and [[silver]] have been chosen again and again throughout [[history of money|history as money]] in more societies and in more cultures and over longer time periods than any other items.

One key benefit of these features of money is that it facilitates and encourages [[trade]], as [[barter (economics)|barter]] is far less efficient.

== Modern forms ==
[[Banknote]]s (also known as paper money) and [[coin]]s are the most liquid forms of tangible money and are commonly used for small person-to-person transactions. Today, [[gold]] is commonly used as a store of value, but is not often used as a medium of exchange or a unit of account.  But central banks do use gold as a unit of account. 

There are also less tangible forms of money, which nevertheless serve the same functions as money. [[cheque|Checks]], [[debit card]]s and [[wire transfer]]s are used as means to more easily transfer larger amounts of money between bank accounts. [[Electronic money]] is an entirely non-physical currency that is traded and used over the internet.

== Credit ==
{{Main|Credit (finance)}} or {{Main|Usury}}
[[Credit (finance)|Credit]] is often loosely referred to as money.  Money is used to buy goods and services, whereas credit buys goods and services on the promise to pay with money in the future.

This distinction between money and credit causes much confusion in discussions of [[monetary policy|monetary theory]]. In lay terms, and when convenient in academic discussion, credit and money are frequently used interchangeably. For example, bank deposits are generally included in summations of the national broad [[money supply]]. However, any detailed study of monetary theory needs to recognize the proper distinction between money and credit.

Bank notes are a form of credit.  Gold-backed bills are likewise also a debt of the bank, a promise to pay in gold.  

[[Federal Reserve note]]s, which are used as money in the United States, are difficult to describe in terms of credit or debt or money.  Federal Reserve notes are not a promise to pay in gold, and the notes are irredeemable by the issuer.  The Federal Reserve's notes are perhaps viewed best as a political promise to devalue (inflate) at a certain targeted rate.

Since Federal Reserve notes are used in the United States as the most common medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, they are considered money by the majority of the population.  To measure this kind of credit money, various forms of credit are counted together and listed as M1 or M2.  M3 was the most common measure of monetary aggregrates (or [[money supply]]), but the publication of M3 was discontinued by the RBA in March, 2006.

== Creation of Money ==

Although types of money are easily identified and distinguished, the actual nature of money and the manner in which it is created is less easily understood. The fact that commodities such as gold, silver, furs or tobacco leaves have value does not make any of them money. It becomes money only when it is widely accepted as a symbol representing a certain value of goods and services and readily accepted in exchange for other goods and services of commensurate perceived value. Trust in its authenticity and universal acceptance and confidence in the availability of goods and services for redemption are essential criteria.

The creation of money is also a subject of considerable confusion and superstition. The creation of commodity money was made possible by the discovery or production of more of the particular commodity, such as gold or barley. As commerce expanded, trade became the primary means for creation of new money. Traders supplied goods to their buyers on credit through bills of exchange which the buyer endorsed and promised to pay within a given period of time. Bills endorsed by credit-worthy buyers or their guarantors then become a form of currency that could be used by the note holder to make additional purchases. At a later date banks became the principle source of new money. Banks take in deposits and issue loans to borrowers either by paying out some of the currency receipted on deposit or simply by creating a new deposit in the borrowers account without receiving currency to back it up. By this means banks create many times more money than the amount they receive or hold on deposit. Central banks in turn further multiply the amount of currency and demand deposits by printing additional currency and using it to purchase government bonds or by lending it to commercial banks by creating fresh deposits at the central bank for the bank just as the bank does for its own borrowers.

== Economic value of money ==

The value of money depends on what it can purchase, not what it is made of. Fiat money has value because it can be utilized to purchase goods and services, even though it has no intrinsic value or utility other than as a medium of exchange. It is more difficult to concede that the same is true of gold and silver. While their intrinsic value remains unaltered by the quantity available, their value as a medium of exchange is directly depend on the availability of goods and services for sale. This is illustrated by the fact that when huge quantities of gold and even larger amounts of silver were discovered in the New World and brought back to Europe for conversion into coin, the purchasing power of those coins fell by 60% to 80%, i.e. prices of commodities rose, because the supply of goods for sale did not keep pace with the increased supply of money.<ref> Galbraith, J.K., ''Money: Whence it came, where it went'',Penguin, UK, 1975, p.20-21.</ref>  In addition, the relative value of silver to gold shifted dramatically downward.<ref> Weatherford, J., "Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World", Ballantine Books, US 1988, p16</ref> 

Today's national currencies are backed by the governments that issue them, not by gold or silver, and the governments are backed by the productive capacity of the societies they represent.

=== Problems with precious metals as money ([[specie]]) ===
There is no perfect money, although it is argued that silver or gold may come close to this standard.  Gold is too valuable to use for small purchases, and silver is too heavy and bulky in large quantities.  Today, since gold is demonetized and forced to compete with paper currencies it does have a spread of about 1-4% to buy and sell in terms of the paper currency, whereas paper money can be exchanged freely.   The exchange premium comes from the relative scarcity of people to exchange paper for gold or silver.  The scarcity has resulted in having to pay coin dealers a small profit for the service.  If silver and gold were remonetized, then there would be no shortage of sources for exchange.  Accordingly the premiums charged would drop to nothing in an economy that recognized silver or gold as lawful money.  Although gold itself does not decay, gold coins are easily scratched or damaged, and this can reduce their value and fungibility.  From 1980 to 2001, gold was a poor store of value, as gold prices dropped from a high of $850/oz. to a low of $255/oz.  The advantage of gold and silver, however, lies in the fact that, unlike fiat paper currency, the supply cannot be increased arbitrarily by a central bank.

On the other hand, gold, silver and other metals are subject to regular and sometimes extraordinary supply increases and decreases. They are virtually created by being dug out of the ground, although there is a cost for this. In the 16th century the Spanish possessions in the Americas produced huge amounts of new money, which produced economic fluctuations throughout the world. Similarly, precious metals are subject to hoarding by individuals, sometimes in the form of jewellery, sometimes as coins or ingots. While this may be rational behaviour for indivduals (as gifts, or savings, or an expression of fear about future circumstances) this results in an increase in the amount of "dead" (i.e. non-circulating) money, a decrease in supply and possibly an increase in the value of the metal. Imbalances between the values of gold, silver and other metals, possibly caused by the fluctuations of such supplies and demands have often led to scarcity of coins in many societies. Shipping coins from one jurisdiction to another so that they could be reminted was sometimes a lucrative trade before the advent of trusted paper money.

=== Problems with paper as money ===
Due to the ease of production, paper money may lose value through [[inflation]] and, in today's electronic era, vast quantities of money can be created with a few key strokes.  Perhaps the biggest criticism of paper money relates to the fact that its stability is generally subject to the whim of government regulation rather than the disciplines of market phenomena.  Paper money can be easily damaged or destroyed by everyday hazards: from fire, water, termites, and simple wear and tear.  Money in the form of minted coins is sometimes destroyed by children placing it on railroad tracks or in amusement park machines that restamp it.  Mexico has changed its twenty peso note and Singapore its $2 and $10 bills to plastic for the increased durability.  Paper money is also subject to counterfeiting.

== Money Supply ==
{{Main|Money supply}}

[[دوتنه:Money-supply.png|thumb|right|U.S. Money Supply from 1959-2006]]The money supply is the amount of money available within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. The supply in the United States is usually considered as four escalating categories M0, M1, M2 and M3. The categories grow in size with M3 representing all forms of money (including credit) and M0 being just base money (coins, bills, and central bank deposits). M0 is also money that can satisfy private banks' reserve requirements. In the [[United State]]s, the [[Federal Reserve]] is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the [[Euro area]] the respective institution is the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the [[Bank of Japan]], [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of England]].

When gold is used as money, the money supply can grow in either of two ways.  First, the money supply can increase as the amount of gold increases by new gold mining at about 2% per year, but it can also increase more during periods of gold rushes and discoveries, such as when Columbus discovered the new world and brought gold back to Spain, or when gold was discovered in California in 1848.  This kind of increase helps debtors, and causes inflation, as the value of gold goes down.  Second, the money supply can increase when the value of gold goes up, as this makes existing stocks of gold more valuable.  This kind of increase helps savers and creditors and is called deflation, where items for sale are increasingly less expensive in terms of gold.  Deflation was the more typical situation for over a [[century]] when gold was used as money in the U.S. from 1792 to 1913.

== Social and psychological value of money ==
{{Main|Social and psychological value of money}}

Money is universally valued; so much so, that we take its value as self-evident and in need of no explanation. Money today is valued for the products and services for which it can be exchanged, the security it provides against unexpected needs, the economic power it generates, the political influence it exerts, the social status it offers to those who possess it, the self-confidence and sense of accomplishment it fosters in those who earn it. 

Theories abound to explain the economic value of money in terms of purchasing power. But in order to fully understand the value of money, economic theory is not sufficient. Money has acquired the all-pervasive value that it possesses today by a slow evolutionary process that can be most easily understood by tracing its social and psychological origins from ancient times. Money has to be viewed in a wider context as a social institution based on the consent of the population and as a psychological symbol based on the consent of the individual.

== Linkages between money and other social institutions ==
{{Main|Integration of money with other social institutions}}

The evolution of money illustrates how each new social institution creates linkages with other existing social institutions as it develops and those linkages gradually expand into complex networks of relationships until they become inseparable elements of a single social web. The evolution of money began as a medium of exchange and measure of value money, thus serving as a stimulant for the exchange of goods and services. As a medium for storage of value, it gave rise to banking. By creating and lending money, banks became catalysts for the further development of trade and industry. In the form of taxation, money supported the development of government. These linkages are direct expressions of the primary powers of money to facilitate transactions. 

In addition, money exercises secondary influences on the society. Politically, the right to collect taxes helped monarchy centralize power and influence in a national government. At a later stage, the ever increasing need of that government for more funds made it increasingly dependent and subject to those sections of society that possessed or controlled large sums of money. The English Parliament eventually rested power from the king by first acquiring the sole right to raise taxes, paving the way for democracy. Later the wealthy merchant class acquired increasing influence over the political establishment. Socially, money has helped breakdown the rigid class structure which allocated privileges according to one’s birth. In a money economy access to goods and services is based on the capacity to pay rather than one’s social origins. Thus it helps eliminate social discrimination based on caste and class.

== Private currencies ==
{{Main|Private currency}}
In many countries, the issue of private paper currencies has been severely restricted by law.

[[دوتنه:Delaware Bridge Company Dollar.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A private 1 dollar note, issued by the "Delaware Bridge Company" of [[New Jersey]] 1836-1841.]]

In the [[United States]], the [[Banking in the United States|Free Banking Era]] lasted between 1837 and 1866. States, municipalities, private banks, railroad and construction companies, stores, restaurants, churches and individuals printed an estimated 8,000 different monies by 1860. If the issuer went bankrupt, closed, left town, or otherwise went out of business the note would be worthless. Such organizations earned the nickname of "[[wildcat banking|wildcat banks]]" for a reputation of unreliability and that they were often situated in far-off, unpopulated locales that were said to be more apt to wildcats than people. On the other hand, according to Lawrence H. White's article in
[http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=2046 The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty - October 1993] "''it turns out that “wildcat” banking is largely a myth. Although stories about crooked banking practices are entertaining&mdash;and for that reason have been repeated endlessly by textbooks&mdash;modern economic historians have found that there were in fact very few banks that fit any reasonable definition of wildcat bank''."
In [[Australia]], the [[Australian Bank Notes Tax Act 1910|Bank Notes Tax Act of 1910]] basically shut down the circulation of private currencies by imposing a prohibitive tax on the practice. Many other nations have similar such policies that eliminate private sector competition. 

In [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] private sector banks are licensed to print their own paper money by the government. 
Today privately issued [[electronic money]] is in circulation.  Some of these private currencies are backed by historic forms of money such as gold, as in the case of [[digital gold currency]].  Transactions in these currencies represent an annual turnover value in billions of US dollars. 

It is possible for privately issued money to be backed by any material, although some people argue about perishable materials. The material used to back money changes with the times.  Gold, silver, and platinum now have, in some regards, less utility than they did previously (their electrical properties notwithstanding). This makes things such as energy (measured in joules), transport (measured in kilogramme*kilometre/hour), or food [http://www.economist.com/markets/bigmac/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3503641] more useful for backing money. It is important to understand that money is above all an agreement to use something as a medium of exchange. It is up to a community (or to whoever holds the power within a community) to decide whether money should be backed by a certain material or should be totally virtual.

== The Future of Money ==
In recent years, the [[Euro]] was introduced to many nations in Europe, which now almost all use one currency. (The United Kingdom and Sweden are notable exceptions.) 

West Africa is proposing to introduce the [[Eco (currency)|Eco]], a new currency for 5 or 6 nations, by 2009.

It is speculated that a North American currency, such as the [[Amero]] might come next.  An [[Asian Currency Unit]] is also proposed.

In the Middle East, many nations use the dinar.  An [[Islamic gold dinar]] is also proposed.

In Mexico, there is a movement to return to using silver as money. <ref>http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_05/salinas102806.html</ref>

One difficulty with currency blocks unifying paper currencies is that it may eliminate the ability of trillions worth of dollars to be exchanged on currency markets.  If this kind of trading were to move into the gold and silver markets, the prices for gold and silver could soar.

Today, gold and paper money can be traded electronically via online systems.  Perhaps ultimately the world will end up trading gold and silver in electronic form.
