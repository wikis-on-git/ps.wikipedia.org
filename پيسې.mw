The [[money supply]] of a country is usually held to consist of [[currency]] (banknotes and coins) and [[demand deposits]] or 'bank money' (the balance held in [[checking accounts]] and [[savings accounts]]). These [[demand deposit]]s usually account for a much larger part of the money supply than currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/money-in-motion/treasure-trove/ |title=Learn More About Coins and Money  Treasure Trove - Philadelphia Fed |publisher=Philadelphia Fed. |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/on2/money/history.html |title=On2 Money / A History of Money |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> [[Bank money]] is intangible and exists only in the form of various bank records.

== History of money ==
{{Main|History of money}}
The use of [[barter]]-like methods may date back to at least 100,000 years ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter.<ref>[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. 'The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.' pp. 36-37.</ref> Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of [[gift economics]]. When barter did occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies.<ref>Graeber, David. 'Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value'. pp. 153-154.</ref> 

[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A 640 BCE one-third [[stater]] [[electrum]] coin from [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydia]].]]
Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of [[commodity money]]. The [[shekel]] was an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of [[barley]] which related other values in a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] such as silver, bronze, copper etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of [[currency]] and a unit of weight.<ref>Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52–55.</ref>  Societies in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used [[shell money]] – usually, the shell of the money [[cowry]] (''Cypraea moneta'') were used. According to [[Herodotus]], and most modern scholars, the [[Lydians]] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coin.<ref>Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94</ref> It is thought that these first stamped [[coins]] were minted around 650–600 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |title=Goldsborough, Reid. "World's First Coin" |publisher=Rg.ancients.info |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref>  

The system of [[commodity money]] eventually evolved into a system of [[representative money]]. This occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors – redeemable for the [[commodity money]] deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or [[banknotes]] were first used in China during the Song Dynasty. These banknotes, known as "[[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]]" evolved from [[promissory notes]] that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity money, and were used alongside coins. Banknotes were first issued in Europe by [[Stockholms Banco]] in 1661, and were again also used alongside coins.
The [[gold standard]], a monetary system where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th-19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made [[legal tender]], and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.

After [[World War II]], at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the [[US dollar]]. The US dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the US government suspended the covertability of the US dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the US dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of legal tender.

===Etymology===

The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of [[Hera]], located on [[Capitoline]], one of Rome's seven hills.  In the ancient world Hera was often associated with money. The temple of [[Juno Moneta]] at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.<ref>D'Eprio, Peter & Pinkowish, Mary Desmond (1998). What Are The Seven Wonders Of The World? First Anchor Books, p.192. ISBN 0-385-49062-3</ref> The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).

In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been ''[[wikt:specie|specie]]'', stemming from Latin ''in specie'', meaning 'in kind'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=specie&searchmode=phrase |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref>

== Functions ==
{{Economics sidebar}}
In the past, money was generally considered to have the following four main functions, which are summed up in a [[rhyme]] found in older economics textbooks: "Money is a matter of functions four, a [[medium]], a [[measure]], a [[standard]], a store."  That is, money functions  as a [[medium of exchange]], a [[unit of account]], a [[standard of deferred payment]], and a [[store of value]].<ref name="greco"/> However, most modern textbooks now list only three functions, that of [[medium of exchange]], [[unit of account]], and [[store of value]], not considering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.<ref name="mankiw"/><ref name="krugman">Krugman, Paul & Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York (2006)</ref><ref name="abel_bernanke">{{cite book|last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke  |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th |pages=266-269 |chapter=7}}</ref>

There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a [[medium of exchange]] is in conflict with its role as a [[store of value]]: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate.<ref name="greco" />  Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time.<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/msT.html ''Theory of Money and Credit'']{{ndash}} Library of Economics and Liberty</ref>  The term 'financial capital' is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender.

=== Medium of exchange ===


When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a ''medium of exchange''. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the '[[double coincidence of wants]]' problem.

=== Unit of account ===


A ''unit of account'' is a standard numerical unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a "measure" or "standard" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt. To function as a 'unit of account', whatever is being used as money must be:

* Divisible into smaller units without loss of value; precious metals can be coined from bars, or melted down into bars again.
* [[Fungibility|Fungible]]: that is, one unit or piece must be perceived as equivalent to any other, which is why [[diamond]]s, works of [[art]] or [[real estate]] are not suitable as money.
* A specific weight, or measure, or size to be verifiably countable. For instance, coins are often made with ridges around the edges, so that any removal of material from the coin (lowering its commodity value) will be easy to detect.

=== Store of value ===

To act as a ''store of value'', a commodity, a form of money, or [[financial capital]] must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved — and be predictably useful when it is so retrieved. Fiat currency like paper or [[electronic money]] no longer backed by gold in most countries is not considered by some economists to be a store of value.

=== Standard of deferred payment ===

While ''standard of deferred payment'' is distinguished by some texts,<ref name="greco" /> particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other functions.<ref name="mankiw"/><ref name="krugman"/><ref name="abel_bernanke"/> A "standard of deferred payment" is an accepted way to settle a [[debt]] – a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as [[legal tender]], in those jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to [[inflation]] and [[deflation]], and for sovereign and international debts via [[debasement]] and [[devaluation]].

== Money supply ==


In economics, money is a broad term that refers to any [[Instrument (finance)|financial instrument]] that can fulfill the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively referred to as the [[money supply]] of an economy. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments  (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a  [[monetary aggregate]]. Modern monetary theory distinguishes among different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the liquidity of the financial instrument used as money.

=== Market liquidity ===

''Market liquidity'' describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognised and accepted as the common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] to trade goods and services easily without having to barter.

Liquid financial instruments are easily [[tradable]] and have low [[transaction cost]]s. There should be no (or minimal) [[Bid/offer spread|spread]] between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.

=== Measures of money ===

The money supply is the amount of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. The money supply is usually measured as three escalating categories M1, M2 and M3. The categories grow in size with M1 being currency (coins and bills) and checking account deposits. M2 is currency, checking account deposits and savings account deposits, and M3 is M2 plus [[time deposit]]s. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments.

Another measure of money, M0, is also used, although unlike the other measures, it does not represent actual purchasing power by firms and households in the economy. M0 is [[base money]], or the amount of money actually issued by the [[central bank]] of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the [[reserve requirements]] of commercial banks.

== Types of money ==
Currently, most modern monetary systems are based on fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, commodity money was eventually replaced by [[representative money]], such as the [[gold standard]], as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver burdensome. Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since the breakup of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in the early 1970s. 

=== Commodity money ===



Many items have been used as [[commodity money]] such as naturally scarce [[precious metal]]s, [[conch shell]]s, [[barley]], beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having [[value]]. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.<ref name="Mises"/> Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[rice]], salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived [[value]] in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or [[Price System]] economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic [[unit of account]] for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some [[gold coins]] such as the  [[Krugerrand]] are considered [[legal tender]], there is no record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.<ref> http://www.randrefinery.com/products_krugerrands.htm Retrieved July-18-09</ref>
[[American Gold Eagle|American Eagle]]s are imprinted with their gold content and legal tender [[face value]].<ref name="usmint.gov"/>[[South Africa]] ranks among the very few countries where gold coins have been minted as negotiable currency and still remain available for general purchase<ref>http://www.samint.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86:kruger-national-park-110th-birthday-celebration-krugerrand-set&catid=21&Itemid=3 'Background and Technical Information on the Krugerrand', Retrieved July-18-09</ref> The [[ISO 4217|ISO currency code]] of gold [[bullion]] is [[XAU]]. ISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals ([[gold]], [[silver]], [[palladium]] and [[platinum]]; by definition expressed per one [[troy ounce]], as compared to "1 USD") and certain other entities used in international finance, e.g. [[Special Drawing Rights]].

=== Fiat money ===
[[File:banknotes.jpg|thumb|Banknotes from all around the world donated by visitors to the [[British Museum]], London.]]
{{Main|Fiat money}}

Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]] in the U.S.)  to be [[legal tender]], making it unlawful to not accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.<ref>{{cite web |author = Deardorff, Prof. Alan V. |year      = 2008 |title     = Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics |url       = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/f.html |publisher = Department of Economics, University of Michigan |accessdate = 2008-07-12}}</ref><ref>Black, Henry Campbell (1910). "A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions Of The Terms And Phrases Of American And English Jurisprudence, Ancient And Modern", page 494. West Publishing Co. [[Black’s Law Dictionary]] defines the word "fiat" to mean "a short order or warrant of a Judge or magistrate directing some act to be done; an authority issuing from some competent source for the doing of some legal act"</ref>

Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins) can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve notes (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.<ref>[http://www.bep.treas.gov/section.cfm/8/39 Shredded & mutilated: Mutilated Currency], ''Bureau of Engraving and Printing''. Retrieved 2007-05-09.</ref> By contrast, commodity money which has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.

=== Credit money ===
{{Main|Credit money}}

[[Credit money]] is any claim against a physical or legal person that can be used for the purchase of goods and services.<ref name="Mises">Mises, Ludwig von. [[The Theory of Money and Credit]], (Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, Inc., 1981), trans. H. E. Batson. Available online here [http://www.econlib.org/library/mises/msT1.html]; accessed 9 May 2007; [http://www.econlib.org/library/mises/msT1.html#Part%20I,Ch.3 Part One: The Nature of Money, Chapter 3: The Various Kinds of Money, Section 3: Commodity Money, Credit Money, and Fiat Money, Paragraph 25].</ref> Credit money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: It is not payable on demand (although in the case of fiat money, "demand payment" is a purely symbolic act since all that can be demanded is other types of fiat currency) and there is some element of risk that the [[real value]] upon fulfillment of the claim will not be equal to real value expected at the time of purchase.<ref name="Mises" />

This risk comes about in two ways and affects ''both'' buyer and seller. First it is a claim and the claimant may default (not pay). High levels of default have destructive supply side effects. If manufacturers and service providers do not receive payment for the goods they produce, they will not have the resources to buy the labor and materials needed to produce new goods and services. This reduces supply, increases prices and raises [[unemployment]], possibly triggering a period of [[stagflation]]. In extreme cases, widespread defaults can cause a lack of confidence in lending institutions and lead to [[economic depression]]. For example, abuse of credit arrangements is considered one of the significant causes of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.<ref>Barry Eichengreen and Kris Mitchener, [http://www.bis.org/publ/work137.htm "The Great Depression as a credit boom gone wrong"], ''Bank For International Settlements, Working Papers'' No. 137 (September 2003). Retrieved 2007-05-08.</ref>

The second source of risk is time. Credit money is a promise of ''future'' payment. If the interest rate on the claim fails to compensate for the combined impact of the [[inflation rate|inflation]] (or [[deflation]]) rate and the [[time value of money]], the seller will receive less real value than anticipated. If the interest rate on the claim overcompensates, the buyer will pay more than expected. The process of [[fractional-reserve banking]] has a cumulative effect of [[money creation]] by banks.

=== Representative money ===


In 1875 economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] described what he called "[[representative money]]," i.e., money that consists of [[token coin]]s, or other physical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such as [[gold]] or [[silver]]. The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.<ref name="Jevons">{{cite book|last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=Money and the Mechanism of Exchange|date=1875|chapter=XVI: Representative Money|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=318&chapter=9990&layout=html&Itemid=27|accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref>

== Monetary policy ==


When gold and silver are used as money, the money supply can grow only if the supply of these metals is increased by mining. This rate of increase will accelerate during periods of gold rushes and discoveries, such as when Columbus discovered the new world and brought back gold and silver to Spain, or when gold was [[California Gold Rush|discovered in California in 1848]]. This causes inflation, as the value of gold goes down. However, if the rate of gold mining cannot keep up with the growth of the economy, gold becomes relatively more valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) will drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a [[century]] when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Modern day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer tied to the value of gold. The control of the amount of money in the economy is known as monetary policy. Monetary policy is the process by which a [[government]], central bank, or monetary authority manages the [[money supply]] to achieve specific goals. Usually the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate economic growth in an environment of stable prices. For example, it is clearly stated in the [[Federal Reserve Act]] that the [[Board of Governors]] and the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] should seek “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”<ref> The Federal Reserve. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_2.pdf 'Monetary Policy and the Economy".] ([[PDF]]) ''Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System'', ([[2005-07-05]]). Retrieved [[2007-05-15]].</ref>

A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that depends on it. These include [[hyperinflation]], [[stagflation]], [[recession]], high [[unemployment]], shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]].

Governments and central banks have taken both regulatory and free market approaches to monetary policy. Some of the tools used to control the money supply include:

* changing the [[interest rate]] at which the government loans or borrows money
* currency purchases or sales
* increasing or lowering government borrowing
* increasing or lowering government spending
* manipulation of [[exchange rate]]s
* raising or lowering bank reserve requirements
* regulation or prohibition of private currencies
* taxation or tax breaks on imports or exports of capital into a country

In the US, the [[Federal Reserve]] is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the [[Euro area]] the respective institution is the [[European Central Bank]]. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the [[Bank of Japan]], [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of England]].

For many years much of monetary policy was influenced by an economic theory known as monetarism. [[Monetarism]] is an economic theory which argues that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key finding of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Milton Friedman, Anna Jacobson Schwartz, |title=Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-691-00354-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> supported by the work of [[David Laidler]],<ref>{{cite book |author=David Laidler, |title=Money and Macroeconomics: The Selected Essays of David Laidler (Economists of the Twentieth Century) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=1-85898-596-X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> and many others. The nature of the demand for money changed during the 1980s owing to technical, institutional, and legal factors and the influence of monetarism has since decreased.
