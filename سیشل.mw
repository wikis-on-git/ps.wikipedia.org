'''Seychelles''', officially the '''Republic of Seychelles''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/seɪˈʃel/}} or {{IPA|/seɪˈʃelz/}}; [[French language|French]]: ''République des Seychelles'', pronounced {{IPA|/seʃɛl/}}; [[Seychellois Creole|Creole]]: ''Repiblik Sesel''), is an [[archipelago]] nation of 115 islands in the [[Indian Ocean]], some 1,600 km east of mainland [[Africa]], northeast of the island of [[Madagascar]]. Other nearby island countries and territories include [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]] to the south, [[Comoros]] and [[Mayotte]] to the southwest, and the [[Suvadives]] of the [[Maldives]] to the northeast.
== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Seychelles]]''

While [[Arab]] traders were probably the first to visit the uninhabited Seychelles, the first recorded sighting of them took place in [[1505]], by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. As a transit point for trading between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], they were occasionally used by [[pirate]]s until the [[France|French]] began to take control of the islands starting in [[1756]], naming them after [[Jean Moreau de Sechelles]], the then French finance minister.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] contested control over the islands with the French between [[1794]] and [[1811]], with the British eventually gaining the upper hand and being ceded the islands in [[1814]]. The Seychelles became a [[crown colony]] separate from [[Mauritius]] in [[1903]] and independence was granted in [[1976]], as a [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The 1979 [[constitution]] declared a [[socialism|socialist]] one-party state, which lasted until [[1992]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Seychelles}}
The Seychelles [[president]], who is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], is elected by popular vote for a five-year term of office. The previous president, [[France Albert René]], was democratically elected after the [[constitution]]al reforms of [[1992]], though he had been in power since a [[coup d'état]] in [[1977]]. He stood down in [[2004]] in favour of his vice-president, [[James Michel]]. The [[cabinet]] is presided over and appointed by the president, subject to the approval of a majority of the legislature.

The [[unicameral]] Seychellois [[parliament]], the [[National Assembly of Seychelles|National Assembly]] or ''Assemblée Nationale'', consists of 34 members, of whom 25 are elected directly by popular vote, while the remaining 9 seats are appointed proportionally according to the percentage of votes received by each party. All members serve five-year terms.

Politics is a topic of hot debate in the country - with many claiming there is a social and economic divide between the two leading parties and their supporters.

The Seychelles are part of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]].

== Administrative divisions ==
[[دوتنه:BigBenVictoriaSeychelles.JPG|thumb|the famous clock tower in the center of Victoria, capital of Seychelles]]
''Main article: [[Districts of Seychelles]]''

Seychelles is divided into 25 administrative regions, called districts:

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Se-map.gif|thumb|Map of the Seychelles]]
{{main|Geography of Seychelles}}

The Seychelles constitute an [[archipelago]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] of 41 islands, of which 33 are inhabited. The group of islands around [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]] consist of [[granite]] and are the largest and most populated of the country. The remaining outer group consists of smaller [[coral]]line [[atoll]]s. The capital city, [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], is situated on Mahé, which is the largest island and home to about 80% of the total population, as well as the Seychelles' highest point, the [[Morne Seychellois]] at 905 m.

The local [[climate]] is tropical, tempered by marine influences and fairly humid. The southwest [[monsoon]] is a generally cooler season which lasts from late May to September, while the warmer northwest monsoon lasts from October to May. The Seychelles are fortunate to lie outside the [[tropical cyclone]] belt.

Seychelles largely escaped the [[2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake|Asian Tsunami of December 2004]] spawned by an earthquake. However, the islands did see significant flooding and damage - as well as loss of marine life and death toll of three people.

The Seychelles also claims the [[Glorioso Islands]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Seychelles}}

Since independence in [[1976]], per capita output has expanded to roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level. Growth has been led by the [[tourism|tourist]] sector, which employs about 30% of the labour force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by [[tuna]] fishing. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services.

At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of [[farming]], [[fishing]], and small-scale [[manufacturing]]. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in [[1991]]-[[1992]] due largely to the country's significantly overvalued exchange rate, the [[Gulf War]] and once again following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the U.S.. Other issues facing the government are the curbing of the [[budget deficit]], including the containment of [[social welfare]] costs, and further [[privatisation]] of public enterprises.  The government has a pervasive presence in economic activity, with public enterprises active in petroleum product distribution, insurance, banking, imports of basic products, telecommunications, and a wide range of other businesses.

Growth slowed in [[1998]]–[[2001]], due to sluggish tourist and tuna sectors. Also, tight controls on exchange rates and the scarcity of foreign exchange have impaired short-term economic prospects. The [[black market]] value of the [[Seychelles rupee]] is half the official exchange rate; without a devaluation of the currency the tourist sector should remain sluggish as tourists seek cheaper destinations such as nearby [[Comoros]] and [[Madagascar]]. A reduction in the number of flights serving the country, primarily due to the inability by airline companies to repatriate funds, has also constrained the growth of the tourism industry. The recent entry of Emirates and Qatar airlines has yet to result in increased growth.

At official exchange rates Seychelles remains the richest country in Africa in terms of [[GDP per capita]]. (US$7,504 as of [[2005]]), although if the parallel exchange rate, or purchasing power parity rates, are used, it ranks behind Mauritius and Botswana.  Because of economic contraction (the economy declined by about 2% in 2004 and 2005 and is set to decline by at least the same level in 2006) the country is moving downwards in terms of per capita income.

It is important to note that Seychelles is, per capita, the most highly indebted country in the world according to the World Bank, with total public debt around 122.8% of GDP.  Approximately two thirds of this debt is owed domestically, with the balance due to multilaterals, bilaterals and commercial banks.  The country is in arrears to most of its international creditors and has had to resort to pledged commercial debt to continue to be able to borrow.  This high debt burden is a direct consequence of the overvalued exchange rate — in essence, the country is living beyond its means, and financing its lifestyle by borrowing domestically and internationally.

== Demographics ==
[[دوتنه:Victoria (Seychelles).jpg|thumb|Victoria, Seychelles]]
''Main article: [[Demographics of Seychelles]]''

As the islands of the Seychelles had no indigenous population, the current Seychellois are composed of immigrants, mostly of [[France|French]], [[Africa]]n, [[India]]n, and [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] descent. [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are official languages along with a French-based [[Seychellois Creole|Creole]]. Most Seychellois are Christians, mostly [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Seychelles]]''
* [[Music of Seychelles]]

The [[folk music]] incorporates multiple influences in a syncretic fashion, including [[England|English]] [[contredanse]], [[polka]] and [[mazurka]], French folk and pop, [[sega music|sega]] from [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]], [[taarab]], [[soukous]] and other pan-African genres, and [[Polynesia]]n, [[India]]n and [[Arcadia]]n music.  A complex form of [[percussion instrument|percussion]] music called [[contombley]] is popular, as is [[montea]], a fusion of native folk rhythms with [[Kenya]]n [[benga]] developed by [[Patrick Victor]].

Some 90 percent of the population was [[Roman Catholic]] as of 1992. Approximately 7 percent of Seychellois are [[Anglicans]]. Although [[clergy]] and civil authorities disapprove, many Seychellois see little inconsistency between their orthodox religious observance and belief in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[witchcraft]], and [[sorcery]].

== Fauna and flora ==
[[دوتنه:Palm_spider.jpg|thumb|palm spider, Seychelles]]

The early colonial history of Seychelles is infamous for the disappearance of most of the giant tortoises from the granitic islands, felling of coastal and mid-level forests and extinction of species such as the Chesnut flanked white eye, the Seychelles parakeet and the saltwater crocodile. The Seychelles today is known for success stories in protecting its flora and fauna. Conservation started in the 1960's by a small group of local enthusiasts. Although many of the conservation laws date back to British colonial days, the Seychelles government has strictly protected the natural heritage of the islands for many years. Flagship [[species]], the Seychelles Magpie Robin and the Seychelles Warbler, have been spectacularly rescued from the brink of extinction by BirdLife International and its local partner Nature Seychelles, supported by the  Royal Society for Nature Conservation,   private islands and the government. These birds, once restricted to one island each, have been translocated to many others. Seychelles has 12 [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] bird species including the Seychelles Flycatcher, Scops Owl, White Eye, Swiftlet, Kestrel, Blue Pigeon and Sunbird.  

Seychelles is home to 2 [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s run by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. They are the island of Aldabra, which is the world's largest raised coral atoll and also the Vallée de Mai on Praslin island, billed as the original site of the Garden of Eden. The Cousin Island Special Reserve, purchased by BirdLife International in 1968, is an internationally-known bird and marine sanctuary which has won several awards for conservation and ecotourism. Seychelles has six national marine parks including the St. Anne National Marine Park located adjacent to the capital, Port Victoria which are managed by the government parastatal, Marine Parks Authority. Much of the land territory (about 40%) and a substantial part of the coastal sea around Seychelles are protected as National Parks, including Marine Parks, and Reserves.

Several private island owners, especially those with up market hotel resorts, have collaborated with the government and the [[NGO]] Nature Seychelles to restore island habitats and to re-introduce threatened species. These islands incude Fregate, Denis and Cousine. The management of these islands now employ full time conservation officers and fund conservation programmes. The island restoration program has now been taken to the outer islands by the Island Conservation Society, an NGO.

The Seychelles are home to 81 endemic plant species.  Well-known is the [[Coco de mer]], a species of palm that grows only on the islands of [[Praslin]] and [[Curieuse]]. Sometimes nicknamed the 'love nut' because of its suggestive shape, the coco-de-mer is the world's largest seed. The [[jellyfish tree]] is to be found in only a few locations today. This strange and ancient plant has resisted all efforts to propagate it. Other unique plant species include the Wrights Gardenia found only on Aride Island Special Reserve.

The giant tortoises from Aldabra now populate many of the islands of the Seychelles. These unique reptiles can be found even in captive herds. The granitic islands of Seychelles were once thought to support at least three distinct species of giant tortoises, but recently published genetic studies have shown that all the tortoises are of Aldabran origin.

Seychelles hosts some of the largest seabird colonies in the world. Islands such as Bird, Aride, Cousin, Aldabra and Cosmoledo host many species of seabirds including the Sooty Tern, Fairy Tern, White-tailed Tropicbird, Noddies and Frigatebirds.

The marine life around the islands, especially the more remote coral islands, can be spectacular. More than 1000 species of fish have been recorded. Since the use of spearguns and dynamite for fishing was banned through efforts of local conservationists in the 1960's, the wildlife is unafraid of snorklers and divers. Coral bleaching in 1998 has unfortunately damaged most reefs. The taking of marine turtles was completely stopped in 1994, but most turtle populations except on Cousin Island and Aldabra, have not fully recovered. The use of gill nets for shark fishing as well as the practice of shark finning are now banned.
