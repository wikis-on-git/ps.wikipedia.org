Mugabe rose to prominence in the 1960s as the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). For many years in the 1960s and 1970s Mugabe was a political prisoner in Rhodesia. His goal was to replace white minority-rule with a one-party Marxist regime.[3] Having been a political prisoner for 10 years, on release with Edgar Tekere, Mugabe left Rhodesia in 1975 to join the Zimbabwe Liberation Struggle (Rhodesian Bush War) from bases in Mozambique. At the end of the war in 1979, Mugabe emerged as a hero in the minds of many Africans.[4][5] He won the general elections of 1980, the second in which the majority of Black Africans participated in large numbers (though the electoral system in Rhodesia had allowed Black participation based on qualified franchise), amid reports of violent intimidation by the militants he now controlled. Mugabe then became the first Prime Minister after calling for reconciliation between formerly warring parties, including the white people as well as rival parties.
The years following Zimbabwe's independence saw a split between the two key belligerents who had fought alongside each other during the 1970s against the government of Rhodesia. An armed conflict between Mugabe's Maoist-oriented Government and dissident followers of Joshua Nkomo's pro-Marxist ZAPU erupted. Following the deaths of thousands, neither warring faction able to defeat the other, the heads of the opposing movements reached a landmark agreement, whence was created a new ruling party, ZANU PF, as a merger between the two former rivals.[6]
Since 1998 Mugabe's policies have elicited domestic and international condemnation. Mugabe's government supported the Southern African Development Community's intervention in the Second Congo War; expropriated thousands of white-owned farms;[7] printed hundreds of trillions of Zimbabwean dollars, causing hyperinflation;[8] and harassed and intimidated such political opponents as the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).[9] The resulting downward spiral in Zimbabwe's economy[10] has been accompanied by oil and food shortages,[11] massive internal displacement[12] and emigration.[13][14] During this period Mugabe's policies have been denounced in the West and at home as racist against Zimbabwe's white minority.[15][16][17] In July 2008, referring to the Mugabe regime, the Group of Eight released a collective statement saying that they "do not accept the legitimacy of a government that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people".[18]
On September 15, 2008, a power-sharing agreement brokered by then-South African President Thabo Mbeki was signed. Under the deal, Mugabe remained President, Morgan Tsvangirai became Prime Minister,[19] the MDC controls the Republic Police, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front commands the Army, and Arthur Mutambara became Deputy Prime Minister. This deal has remained precarious, with Mugabe's party ceding little actual power and pursuing questionable legal proceedings against MDC members.

==پخوانی ژوند==
Mugabe was raised at Kutama Mission, Zvimba District, north-west of [[Harare]] (then called Salisbury), in then [[Rhodesia|Southern Rhodesia]]. He was raised as a [[Roman Catholic]] and was educated in [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] schools. He qualified as a teacher at age 17, but left to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English and history at [[Fort Hare University]] in [[South Africa]], an illustrious university at the time, graduating in [[1951]] while meeting contemporaries like [[Julius Nyerere]], [[Herbert Chitepo]], [[Robert Sobukwe]] and [[Kenneth Kaunda]]. He then studied at Driefontein in [[1952]], Salisbury ([[1953]]), [[Gwelo]] ([[1954]]), in [[Tanzania]] ([[1955]] - [[1957]]). He obtained a diploma and a bachelor's degree in education from the [[Unisa|University of South Africa]] and another degree in [[economics]] from the [[University of London]], all by correspondence. Subsequently, Mugabe taught in a teacher-training school in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] ([[1958]]&ndash;[[1960]]) where he met Sally Hayfron, who later became his first wife.

==Anti-colonial conflict==
''See also: [[History of Zimbabwe]]''

Returning to Southern Rhodesia in 1960 as a committed [[Marxist]], Mugabe joined [[Joshua Nkomo]] and the National Democratic Party (NDP), which later became the [[Zimbabwe African Peoples Union]] (ZAPU), both immediately banned by [[Ian Smith]]'s government. He left ZAPU in [[1963]] to form the rival [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) with Reverend [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] and lawyer [[Herbert Chitepo]]. It would have been easy for the party to split along tribal lines between the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] tribe and that of Mugabe himself, the [[Shona people|Shona]] tribe, but cross-tribal representation was maintained by his partners. ZANU leader Sithole nominated Mugabe as his Secretary General.

ZANU was influenced by the Africanist ideas of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] in South Africa and influenced by [[Maoism]] while ZAPU was an ally of the [[African National Congress]] and was a supporter of a more orthodox pro-[[Soviet]] line on [[Independence|national liberation]]. Similar divisions can also be seen the in liberation movement in [[Angola]] between the [[MPLA]] and [[UNITA]].

He was detained with other nationalist leaders [[Joshua Nkomo]] and [[Edson Zvobgo]] in [[1964]] and remained in prison for ten years, where he studied law.  On his release he left Rhodesia for [[Mozambique]] in [[1974]] and led the [[China|Chinese]]-financed military ZANU army, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), in the war against [[Ian Smith]]'s government.

On [[18 March]] [[1975]], Chitepo was killed by a bomb placed in his car while in [[Zambia]]. ZANLA commander [[Josiah Tongogara]] was subsequently blamed by [[Kenneth Kaunda]]'s government. Mugabe unilaterally assumed control of ZANU from Mozambique. Later that year, after squabbling with [[Ndabaningi Sithole]], Mugabe formed a militant ZANU faction, leaving Sithole to lead the moderate [[Zanu (Ndonga)]] party, which renounced violent struggle.

==Prime Minister, then Executive President==
''See also: [[Lancaster House Agreement]]''

Persuasion from [[B.J. Vorster]], himself under pressure from [[Henry Kissinger]], forced Smith to accept in principle that white minority rule could not continue indefinitely. On [[March 3]] [[1978]] Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] and other moderate leaders signed an agreement at Governor's Lodge in Salisbury, which paved the way for the interim government, under [[Lord Soames]], a British governor, in preparation for elections.

Elections were held for a new national parliament as [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]], which was won by the only black party that had renounced violence and was allowed to contest &ndash; the UANC, led by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] and [[Canaan Banana]]. Sanctions, however, were not lifted, because Britain and the USA said there was not proper representation in the elections &ndash; meaning Nkomo and Mugabe. Britain called all parties to talks at [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House]] in September [[1979]], which were attended by Smith, Mugabe, Nkomo, [[Edgar Tekere]], [[Chenjerai Hunzvi]], [[Edson Zvobgo]] and others, where Muzorewa was persuaded to accept new elections, which were held late February, [[1980]].

After a campaign marked by intimidation from all sides, mistrust from security forces and reports of full ballot boxes found on the road, the [[Shona people|Shona]] majority was decisive in electing Mugabe to head the first government as prime minister on [[March 4]], [[1980]]. ZANU won 57 out of 80 contested seats in the new parliament, with 20 other seats reserved for whites.

Mugabe, whose political support came from his [[Shona language|Shona-speaking]] homeland in the north, attempted to build Zimbabwe on a basis of an uneasy coalition with his [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) rivals, whose support came from the [[Sindebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking south, and with whites. Mugabe sought to incorporate ZAPU into his [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) led government and ZAPU's military wing into the army; and ZAPU's leader, [[Joshua Nkomo]], was given a series of cabinet positions in Mugabe's government. However, Mugabe was torn between this objective and pressures to meet the expectations of his own ZANU followers for a faster pace of social change.

An abortive ZAPU rebellion and discontent in [[Matabeleland]] spelled the end to this uneasy coalition. In [[1983]] Mugabe dismissed Nkomo from his cabinet, which triggered bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in the [[Sindebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between [[1982]] and [[1985]] the military brutally crushed armed resistance in Ndebeleland and Mugabe's rule was left secure. (''see'' "[[Gukurahundi]]") A peace accord was negotiated in [[1987]], resulting in ZAPU's merger (1988) into the [[Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front]] (ZANU-PF). Mugabe brought Nkomo into the government once again as a vice-president.

In [[1987]] the position of Prime Minister was abolished, and Mugabe assumed the new office of executive President of Zimbabwe gaining additional powers in the process. He was re-elected in [[1990]] and [[1996]], and, in very controversial circumstances, in [[2002]].

==ټولنيزې پروګرامونه==
Mugabe improved health and education for the black majority after elections agreed to after the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in [[1979]].

In [[1991]], amid international pressure and short on hard currency, Zimbabwe embarked on a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[austerity]] program, but the [[International Monetary Fund]] suspended aid, claiming that the reforms were "not on track."

At the same time he pursued a "moral campaign" against [[homosexuality]] or "fags", making what he deemed "unnatural sex acts" illegal with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. This included the arrest of his predecessor as President of Zimbabwe, [[Canaan Banana]], who was convicted of alleged gay sex offences. While Zimbabwe has the highest HIV/AIDS infection rate in the world, the overwhelming majority of sufferers there are heterosexual, and the majority of sufferers are women.[http://www.avert.org/subaadults.htm]

Mugabe was criticized for his intervention in the [[civil war]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] at a time when the [[Economy of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean economy]] was struggling. The DRC had been invaded by Uganda, and Rwanda that sought to institute a change of government The war raised accusations of corruption, with officials alleged to be plundering the Congo's [[mineral]] reserves.

==Land reforms==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Mugabe_(37).jpg|250px|thumb|left|Mugabe, addressing the 114-nation [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] in 2003, is a vocal advocate for [[Third World]] unity and cooperation on  [[economic development]] concerns.]] -->

''Main article: [[Land reform in Zimbabwe]]''

When Mugabe became prime minister, approximately 70% of the country's [[arable]] land was owned by approximately 4,000 descendants of white settlers. However, he reassured white landowners that they had nothing to fear from black majority rule. Mugabe favoured a "willing buyer, willing seller" plan for gradual redistribution of land but little was done in his early years in power. However, in 1999 and 2000 Mugabe used force to transfer land ownership from whites to blacks. Since land redistribution, Zimbabwe has transformed from being an exporter of food to a nation with rampant food shortages. Mugabe's supporters, however, blame Western sanctions and political instability instigated by white landowners.

By 1997, the "willing buyer, willing seller" land reform program had broken down, after the British government led by [[Tony Blair]] unilaterally decided to stop funding it. Not being of the land owning class, members of his government felt themselves under no obligation to continue paying White farmers compensation, or in minister [[Claire Short]]'s words, "I should make it clear that we do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. We are a new Government from diverse backgrounds without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and as you know we were colonised not colonisers."
[http://www.swans.com/library/art9/ankomah5.html]

During the early to mid-1990s Zimbabwe refrained from a more aggressive land reform policy, to give the ANC in South Africa a breathing space in it's negotiations for an end to White minority rule. Within that context, it is clear that the Zimbabwean government decided to unilaterally move forward with land reform outside of the "willing buyer, willing seller" framework.

==د ۲۰۰۰ کال ټولپوښتنه==
On [[February 11]] [[2000]], a [[referendum]] was held on a new [[constitution]]. The proposed change would have limited future presidents to two terms, but as it was not retroactive, Mugabe could have stood for another two terms. It would also have made his government and military officials immune from prosecution for any illegal acts committed while in office. Also, it allowed the government to confiscate white-owned land for redistribution to black farmers without compensation. It was defeated, after a low 20% turnout, by a strong urban vote, fuelled by an effective [[Short message service|SMS]] campaign. Mugabe declared that he would "abide by the will of the people". The vote was a surprise to [[ZANU-PF]], and an embarrassment before parliamentary elections due in mid-April. Almost immediately self-styled "war veterans", led by [[Chenjerai Hunzvi|Chenjerai 'Hitler' Hunzvi]], began invading white-owned farms. On [[April 6]], [[2000]], parliament pushed through an amendment, taken word for word from the draft constitution that was rejected by voters, allowing the seizure of white-owned farmland.

Mugabe faced [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] of the [[Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) in presidential elections in March [[2002]]. Amid accusations of violence and claims that large numbers of citizens in anti-Mugabe strongholds were prevented from voting, Mugabe defeated Tsvangirai by 56% to 42%. Mugabe was helped by an unprecedented turnout of 90% in his rural stronghold of [[Mashonaland]] (55% of the population voted overall), although there are credible claims that the turnout may have been rigged. When election observers from South Africa claimed at a press conference that they had found no evidence of vote rigging, the assembled press burst out with laughter.

On [[July 3rd]], [[2004]], a report [http://www.theindependent.co.zw/news/2004/July/Friday16/1003.html] adopted by the [[African Union]] executive council, which comprises foreign ministers of the 53 member states, criticised the government for the arrests and torture of opposition members of parliament and [[human rights]] lawyers, the arrests of journalists, the stifling of freedom of expression and clampdowns on other civil liberties.

It was compiled by the AU's [[African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights]], which sent a mission to Zimbabwe from [[June 24th]] to 28th [[2002]], shortly after the presidential elections.

The report was apparently not submitted to the AU's [[2003]] summit because it had not been translated into [[French language|French]]. It was adopted at the next AU summit in [[2005]].

Mugabe's ZANU-PF party won the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections]] with an increased majority. The elections were said to "reflect the free will of the people of Zimbabwe" by the South African observers, despite accusations of widespread fraud from the MDC.

==Foreign opposition to Mugabe==
[[Image:ChavezMugabe.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Although President Mugabe encounters considerable opposition from the West, he has strong support throughout governments of the third world. Above, [[President of Venezuela|Venezuela President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] embraces Mugabe during the 60th anniversary celebrations of the [[United Nation]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) in [[Rome]] [[October 17]], [[2005]] At the event, Mugabe and Chávez both denounced the United States and other capitalist countries for trying to dominate the world, invading Iraq and Afghanistan, seeking to impose capitalism in other countries, and blamed them for world poverty and hunger.]]

In recent years Mugabe has emerged as one of Africa's most controversial leaders. His critics accuse him of being a 'corrupt [[dictator]]', and an 'extremely poor role model' for the continent. Nevertheless, Mugabe retains considerable popularity throughout Africa. For example, in 2004 the monthly magazine ''[[New African]]'' had its readers vote for the "100 greatest Africans" last year, Mugabe won a third-place finish, topped only by [[Nelson Mandela]] and Ghanaian independence hero [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. In addition, in December 2005, [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Zambia]]'s former long-time leader, voiced support for Mugabe, stating that the Zimbabwean president "would pull through because he enjoyed the support of ordinary Zimbabweans who were punished for claiming back their land." [http://allafrica.com/stories/200512120752.html] Mugabe's supporters tend to dismiss much of the criticism as being racially motivated, and characterize it as being little more than the bitter remarks of those who have been disadvantaged by his policies.

Since Mugabe began to redistribute white-owned landholdings, he has faced harsh attacks, externally from mostly Western countries including the former colonial power of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], and internally from trade-unions and urban Zimbabweans, who overwhelmingly support the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change]]. In addition, some African figures have condemned Mugabe, such as Archbishop [[Pius Ncube]], the South African Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] (who called Mugabe a "caricature of an African dictator"), and writer [[Wole Soyinka]] (who called Mugabe's regime "a disgrace to the continent" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4703021.stm]), while [[Botswana]] President [[Festus Mogae]] distanced himself from the SADC statement opposing the Commonwealth suspension. Mugabe has been condemned by Western non-governmental organizations such as [[Amnesty International]], charging that he has committed [[human rights]] abuses against minority [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]]s, the opposition MDC, white landowners, and homosexuals. Mugabe and a list of members of his government are now banned from entering the [[European Union]]. 

On [[March 9]] [[2003]], U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] approved measures for [[economic sanctions]] to be leveled against Mugabe and numerous other high-ranking Zimbabwe politicians, freezing their assets and barring Americans from engaging in any transactions or dealings with them. Justifying the move, Bush's spokesman stated the President and Congress believe that "the situation in Zimbabwe endangers the southern African region and threatens to undermine efforts to foster good governance and respect for the rule of law throughout the continent". The bill was known as the "Zimbabwe Democracy Act" and was deemed "racist" by Mugabe. 

On [[December 8]], [[2003]], in protest against a further 18 months of suspension from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (thereby cutting foreign aid to Zimbabwe), Mugabe withdrew his country from the Commonwealth. According to reports, Robert Mugabe informed the leaders of [[Jamaica]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]] of his decision when they telephoned him to discuss the situation. Zimbabwe's government said the President did not accept the Commonwealth's position, and was leaving the group.

Many African nations, led by South Africa, want Zimbabwe to be brought back into the fold to encourage dialogue between Mugabe and domestic foes, while members of what many Africans charge is the "white Commonwealth" &ndash; the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand &ndash; led the hard-line stance on the suspension of Zimbabwe.

[[Pius Ncube]], the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Bulawayo]], leads a consortium of [[Christian]] faiths opposed to Mugabe. Ncube has won human rights awards for opposing the alleged [[torture]] and starvation used as a political weapon by the Mugabe government. In [[2005]], Ncube has called for a "popular mass uprising" in the style of the [[Orange Revolution]] or [[Tulip Revolution]] to remove Mugabe from power.

On [[April 8]], [[2005]], Mugabe defied a European Union travel ban that does not apply to [[Vatican City]] by attending the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II]]. He was granted a transit visa by the Italian authorities, as they are obliged to under the [[Lateran treaties|Concordat]].

Twice, [[Peter Tatchell]] of the [[gay rights]] group [[OutRage!]] has tried to place Mugabe under [[citizen's arrest]] for human rights abuses during the leader's visits to the United Kingdom.

In reaction to human rights violations in Zimbabwe, students at universities from which Mugabe has honorary doctorates have sought to get the degrees revoked. So far, student bodies at [[Michigan State University]] ([[Associated Students of Michigan State University|ASMSU]]) and the [[University of Edinburgh]] ([[Edinburgh University Students' Association|EUSA]]) have each unanimously passed resolutions calling for this. The issue is now being considered by the respective universities.  

In June 2005 Mugabe and his government attracted unprecedented international criticism, including greater church condemnation than ever before when over two hundred thousand people were left homeless by their homes, in urban areas, being bulldozed in [[Operation Murambatsvina]].

==Succession==
As one of Africa's longest-lasting leaders, speculation has built over the years as to the future of Zimbabwe after Mugabe leaves office. His age and recurring rumors of failing health have focused more attention on possible successors within his party as well as the opposition.

In June 2005, a report that Mugabe had entered a hospital for tests on his [[heart]] fueled rumors that he had died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1118181942421_110/?hub=World] these reports were dismissed by a Mugabe spokesman. This coincided with [[Operation Murambatsvina]] (or "Drive Out Trash"), a police campaign to demolish houses and businesses that had been built without permission on land previously taken from white landholders and intended for redistribution. Opponents called this an attempt to disperse urban centers of dissent into rural areas where the government had more control. Former information minister [[Jonathan Moyo]] attributed the events to a power struggle within the party over who would succeed Mugabe.

[[Joyce Mujuru]], recently elevated to vice-president of [[ZANU-PF]] during the December [[2004]] party congress and considerably younger than [[Joseph Msika]], the other vice-president, has been mentioned as a likely successor to Mugabe. Joyce Mujuru's candidacy for the presidency is strengthened by her husband's backing (Solomon Mujuru) who is the former head of the Zimbabwian army.

==Personal==
His well-respected Ghanaian first wife, Sally (née Hayfron, born [[1933]]), died in [[1992]], from a chronic kidney ailment (their only son died at age 4, while Mugabe was in prison). Sally Mugabe was a trained teacher who asserted her position as an independent   political activist and campaigner. This she clearly demonstrated from as early as 1962 when she was active in mobilising African women to challenge Ian Smith's racist Rhodesian constitution which resulted in her own imprisonment. When she became Zimbabwe's first lady in 1980 she served as Deputy Secretary and later as Secretary of the ZANU Women's League. She also founded the Zimbabwe Child Survival Movement. Sally Mugabe launched the Zimbabwe Women's Cooperative in the UK in 1986 and supported Akina Mama wa Africa, a London based African women's organisation focusing on development and women's issues in Africa and the UK. Upon her death she was laid to rest at the National Heroes Acre in Harare, Zimbabwe.

About two years before Sally's death, Mugabe had married his former secretary, Grace Marufu, 40 years his junior and with whom he already had two children, in a tribal ceremony. Abandoning his Christian background, Mugabe justified the marriage under a traditional African law which allows him to take a junior wife.

On [[August 17]], 1996, Mugabe and Marufu were married in a [[Catholic]] wedding Mass at [[Kutama College]], a Catholic Mission School he previously attended.  Nelson Mandela was among the guests.  A spokesman for Catholic Archbishop Patrick Chakaipa, who presided over the ceremony, said the diocese saw "no impediment" to the nuptials.

Mugabe and Marufu have three children: Bona, Robert Jr. and Bellamine.

==Movies==
Mugabe's office forbade the screening of the 2005 movie ''[[The Interpreter]]'' claiming that it was propaganda by the [[CIA]] and fearing that it could incite hostility towards him. [http://zimdaily.com/news2/article.php?story=20050922044503539&query=the%2Binterpreter]
