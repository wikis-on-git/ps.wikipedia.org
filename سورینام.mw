'''Suriname''', officially the '''Republiek Suriname''', is a country in northern [[South America]]. Other common names are '''Surinam''' or '''Sranang'''. It was [[Geographical renaming|formerly known as]] Nederlands Guyana, ''[[Netherlands]] Guiana'' or ''Dutch Guiana''. It lies in between [[French Guiana]] to the east and [[Guyana]] to the west. The southern border is shared with [[Brazil]] and the northern border is the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. The most southern parts of the borders with Guyana and French Guiana are disputed (upper [[Courantyne River|Corantijn]] and [[Maroni River|Marowijne]] rivers&mdash;the map shows the Guyana and French Guiana versions of the border).

== History ==
{{main|History of Suriname}}

Though [[Netherlands|Dutch]] traders had established several colonies in the [[Guyanas]] region before around [[1600]], the Dutch did not gain full control of what is now Suriname until the [[Treaty of Breda]], which marked the end of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. The Netherlands traded [[Manhattan]], in the current state of [[New York]], for [[Suriname]].

In 1883 native people of Suriname were taken to Amsterdam and placed in [[human zoos]] for the International Colonial and Export Exhibition, held behind the [[Rijksmuseum]].

After becoming an autonomous part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in [[1954]], [[independence]] was granted in [[1975]]. A [[Military dictatorship|military regime]] led by [[Dési Bouterse]] ruled the country in the [[1980s]], until [[democracy]] was restored.

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Suriname}}
Suriname is a [[democracy]] based on the 1987 [[constitution]]. The government's [[legislative branch]] is the National Assembly, consisting of 51 members. These members are elected every five years.

The National Assembly elects the head of the [[executive branch]], the president, by a two-third majority. If no candidate achieves such a majority, the president is elected by the People's Assembly, an 869-member institute consisting of the National Assembly and regional representatives.

Suriname is a full & participating member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM).

== Administrative Divisions ==
{{main|Districts of Suriname}}

Suriname is divided into ten [[district]]s:
*[[Brokopondo]]
*[[Commewijne District|Commewijne]]
*[[Coronie]]
*[[Marowijne District|Marowijne]]
*[[Nickerie District|Nickerie]]
*[[Para District|Para]]
*[[Paramaribo District|Paramaribo]]
*[[Saramacca District|Saramacca]]
*[[Sipaliwini]]
*[[Wanica]]

Suriname is further subdivided into 62 ''ressorts''.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Suriname-map.png|thumb|Map of Suriname]]
{{main|Geography of Suriname}}

Suriname is the smallest independent country in [[South America]]. Situated on the [[Guiana]] [[Shield (geography)|Shield]], the country can be divided into two main geographic regions. The northern, lowland coastal area (roughly above the line Albina-Paranam-Wageningen) has been cultivated, and most of the population lives here. The southern part consists of tropical [[rainforest]] and sparsely inhabited [[savanna]] along the [[border]] with [[Brazil]], covering about 80% of Suriname's land surface.

There are two main mountain ranges in Suriname: the Bakhuis Mountains and the Van Asch Van Wijck Mountains. [[Julianatop]] is the highest mountain in the country at 1,286 [[metre]]s (4,219&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]]. Other mountains include [[Tafelberg (mountain)|Tafelberg]] (1,026&nbsp;[[metre|m]]; 3,366&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), [[Mount Kasikasima]] (718&nbsp;m; 2,356&nbsp;ft), [[Goliathberg]] (358&nbsp;m; 1,174&nbsp;ft) and [[Voltzberg]] (240&nbsp;m; 787&nbsp;ft).

Lying near the [[equator]], Suriname has a [[tropical climate]], and temperatures do not vary a lot throughout the year. The year has two [[wet season]]s, from December to early February and from late April to mid-August.

Located in the northeast portion of the country is the [[W.J. van Blommestein Meer]], one of the largest reservoir lakes in the world. It was created in [[1964]] by the Afobakka [[dam]] (Brokopondo project), built to provide [[hydro power]] for the [[bauxite]] industry (which consumes about 75% of the output) and for domestic consumption.

In the upper [[Coppename River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]], the [[Central Suriname Nature Reserve]] is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] cited for its unspoiled rainforest [[biodiversity]]. There are many national parks in the country: Galibi National Reserve, Coppename Manding National Park and Wia Wia NR along the coast, Brownsberg NR, Raleighvallen/Voltzeberg NR, Tafelberg NR and Eilerts de Haan NP in the centre and the Sipaliwani NR on the Brazilian border. In all, 12% of the country's land area are national parks and lakes.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Suriname}}

The [[economics|economy]] of Suriname is dominated by the [[bauxite]] industry, which accounts for more than 15 % of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and 70 % of export earnings. Other main export products include [[sugar]], and Suriname has some [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gold]] reserves. About a quarter of the people work in the [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector. The Surinamese economy is very dependent on other countries, with its main trade partners being the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]] and countries in the [[Caribbean]].

After assuming power in the fall of [[1996]], the [[Jules Albert Wijdenbosch|Wijdenbosch]] government ended the [[structural adjustment]] program of the previous government, claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements of society. [[Tax]] revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government failed to implement new tax alternatives. By the end of [[1997]], the allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese Government relations with the Netherlands deteriorated. Economic growth slowed in [[1998]], with decline in the [[mining]], [[construction]], and [[utility sector]]s. Rampant government expenditures, poor tax collection, a bloated civil service, and reduced foreign aid in [[1999]] contributed to the fiscal deficit, estimated at 11% of GDP. The government sought to cover this deficit through monetary expansion, which led to a dramatic increase in [[inflation]] and [[exchange rate]] depreciation.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Suriname}}

Suriname's population of  438,144 (July 2005 est.) is made up of several distinct ethnic groups. East Indians (known locally as Hindustanis) form the largest group at 37% of the population. They are descendants of [[19th century]] immigrants from [[India]]. They are from the Indian states of [[Bihar]] and Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], in Northern India, along the [[Nepal|Nepalese]] border. The Creoles, mixed white and black, form about 31%, while the [[Javanese]] ("imported" from the former [[Dutch East Indies]]) make up 15%. [[Maroon (slavery)|Maroons]] (descendants of escaped [[Africa]]n slaves) make up 10% and are divided into five main groups: Aucans, Kwinti, Matawi, Paramaccans and Saramaccans. [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] form 3% of the population (some say as low as 1%), the main groups being the [[Akuriyo]], [[Arawak]], [[Carib]]/[[Kaliña]], [[Trío]] and [[Wayana]]. The remainder is formed by [[China|Chinese]], Europeans, and [[Brazilian]] immigrant workers that have arrived in Suriname in recent times. A small [[Jewish]] community composed of several families, descendants of [[Sephardim]] who had earlier fled from Iberia to the Netherlands, also inhabit the country. They previously operated an autonomous region of Suriname called the "[[Jodensavanne]]".

Because of the great number of ethnic groups in the country, there is no one main religion. Most of the Hindustani are [[Hinduism|Hindu]], but [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are also practised by them. Christianity is dominant among Creoles and [[Maroon (slavery)|Maroons]].

[[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of Suriname. The Surinamese also speak their own languages: [[Sranang Tongo]] (also known as Surinaams). This is a mix of several languages. Mainly Dutch, but also English, Portuguese and French, and the local languages. With a little effort, a lot of European people can recognize some words of it. [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and others. Also, the original [[Carib languages|Carib]] and [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] Amerindians of Suriname speak their own languages, as do the Maroons; [[Ndyuka|Aucan]] (n'Djuka or Ndjukas) and [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]]. The second largest language of the nation is [[Hindustani|Sarnami Hindustani]], a form of [[Bihari_languages|Bihari]], which is a dialect of modern India's [[Hindi]] language. Additionally, [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are also widely used, especially at tourist-oriented facilities or shops.

The vast majority of people (about 90%) live in Paramaribo or on the coast. There is also a significant Surinamese population in the [[Netherlands]]. In 2004 there were 321,000 Surinamese people living in the Netherlands, which is about 2% of the total population of the Netherlands.

== Culture ==
