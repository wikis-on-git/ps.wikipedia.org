The '''Kingdom of Sweden''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''{{Audio|sv-Konungariket_Sverige.ogg|Konungariket Sverige}}'') is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] in [[Scandinavia]]. It is bordered by [[Norway]] in the west, [[Finland]] in the northeast, the [[Skagerrak]] Strait and the [[Kattegat]] Strait in the southwest, and the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] in the east. Sweden has a low [[population density]] except in its [[:Category:Metropolitan areas of Sweden|metropolitan areas]], with most of the inland consisting of [[forest]]s. The country has large natural resources of water, timber, and iron ore. Its citizens enjoy a high standard of living in a country that is generally perceived as clean, modern, and liberal.

Following the end of the [[Viking Age]], Sweden became part of the [[Kalmar Union]] together with [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] (Finland at this time was a part of the Swedish kingdom). Sweden left the union in the beginning of the 16th century, and more or less constantly battled its neighbours for many years, especially Russia and the still united [[Denmark-Norway]], which never completely accepted Sweden leaving the union. In the 17th and 18th centuries Sweden extended its territory through [[warfare]] and became a [[Great Power]], twice its current size. By 1814 Sweden had lost its empire as well as Finland, previously an integral part of the Kingdom of Sweden. Since 1814, Sweden has been at peace, adopting a [[non-aligned]] foreign policy in peacetime and [[neutral country|neutrality]] in wartime.

Sweden had been a major European exporter of iron, copper and timber since the middle ages. However, [[transportation in Sweden|improved transportation]] and [[communications in Sweden|communication]] allowed it to utilize natural assets from different parts of the country on a far larger scale, most notably [[Logging|timber]] and [[iron ore]]. Economic liberalization as well as universal schooling contributed to the rapid industrialization and by the 1890s the country had begun to develop an advanced manufacturing industry. In the 20th century a [[welfare state]] began to emerge. Today, Sweden is a generally considered a modern post-industrial country dominated by social liberal political ideas.

[[دوتنه:Royal mounds.JPG|thumb|350px|The three large "royal mounds" at Gamla Uppsala.]]
Soon after the recession of the last ice age, Sweden became populated by [[hunters and gatherers]], during the [[Stone Age]] (6000 BC – 4000 BC). The region developed rather slowly compared to southern Europe; while the Romans wrote poetry, [[Scandinavia]] had just entered the Iron Age.

Sweden was first mentioned in the 1st century, by Roman historian [[Tacitus]], who wrote that the [[Suiones]] tribe lived out in the sea and were powerful in both arms and ships. This referred to the inhabitants of eastern Sweden: [[Svealand]], primarily around lake [[Mälaren]]; [[Sigtuna]], and [[Birka]]. From this tribe, Sweden derived its name (see [[Etymology of Sweden]]). The southern parts, on the other hand, were inhabited by [[Geats]] (Götar) in the [[Götaland]] territory. Little is known for certain about that time, but chronicles based on [[Norse saga]]s and the [[Beowulf]] epic go back about 2,000 years.

During the [[Viking Age]] of the 9th and 10th century, [[Varangian|Swedish vikings]] travelled east setting their mark on the [[Baltic countries]], [[Russia]] whose name comes from the Finnish name for these Vikings: Rus (the Finnish name for Sweden is Ruotsi), the [[Black Sea]], further through the [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|rivers of Russia]] down south to [[Constantinople]] and southern Europe. The Swedish Vikings were somewhat different from their Norwegian and Danish counterparts as they were not as warrior minded but instead were more merchant and settler minded.

[[دوتنه:Gripsholmslott.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gripsholm Castle]] outside [[Mariefred]].]]
With [[Christianization]] in the 12th century, the country became [[Lands of Sweden|consolidated]], with its centre in the agri-cultural regions of Östergötland and Västergötland and later on also in the water-ways of the northern Baltic and the [[Gulf of Finland]]. In the 14th century Sweden, like the rest of Europe, was struck by the [[Black Death]] (the Plague), with all its effect.

During the middle ages, the expansion of Sweden into the northern wilderness of [[Laplandia]], the Scandinavian [[peninsula]], and present-day [[Finland]] continued. Finland was a part of [[Sweden proper]] from the early thirteenth century until 1809.

In 1389, Norway, Denmark and Sweden were united under a single [[monarch]] in a treaty known as the [[Kalmar Union]]. After several wars and disputes between these nations, King [[Gustav I of Sweden]] ([[House of Vasa]]) broke free in 1521 and established a nation state, considered the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards he rejected [[Catholicism]] and led Sweden to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Gustav I is considered to be Sweden's "[[Father of the Nation]]."

{{see|Rise of Sweden as a Great Power|Swedish Empire|Sweden and the Great Northern War|Absolute Monarchy in Sweden|Sweden-Finland|Union between Sweden and Norway}}

The 17th century saw [[Rise of Sweden as a Great Power|the rise of Sweden]] as one of the [[Great Power]]s in Europe, due to successful participation, initiated by King [[Gustav II Adolph of Sweden|Gustav II Adolph]], in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and by [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] in the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] of [[Poland]]. Mighty as it was, it crumbled in the 18th century with [[Imperial Russia]] taking the reins of northern Europe in the [[Great Northern War]], and finally in 1809 when the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was created out of the [[Österland|eastern half]] of Sweden.

After Denmark was defeated in the [[Napoleonic wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden in the [[Treaty of Kiel]]. Norway had meanwhile declared itself independent and this led to the [[Campaign against Norway]], which was fought in 1814. It ended with the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced Norway into a union with Sweden that was not dissolved until 1905. But the campaign also signified the last of the [[Swedish wars]] and its 200 years of peace are arguably unique in the world today.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw a significant population increase, which the writer [[Esaias Tegnér]] in 1833 famously attributed to ''"the peace, the ([[smallpox]]) [[vaccine]], and the [[potatoes]]"'' <ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>, with the population doubling between 1750 and 1850. The large families meant that the farms and homesteads were becoming smaller and smaller, as the children inherited the land from their parents and split it between themselves. The result was [[poverty]] and massive [[emigration]]; it is believed that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the [[United States]]. In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in [[Chicago]] than in [[Gothenburg]] (Sweden's second largest city).

Sweden was traditionally less developed than Western Europe (though more affluent than much of Eastern and Southern Europe); industrialisation began in earnest only after 1870. During the late 19th century, Sweden was influenced by Protestant [[temperance movement]]s, mainly of American origin. As a result of their intense propaganda, it is often claimed that alcohol consumption was unusually high in Sweden at this time<ref>For instance expressed thus: ''As regards social evils generally, however, the low, though undoubtedly improving, standard of Sweden has had one of its chief reasons in the national intemperance.'' [http://25.1911encyclopedia.org/S/SW/SWEDEN.htm Article ''Sweden'' in the online 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica].</ref>. However, there is no factual ground for believing that alcohol consumption was higher than in other comparable countries.

Strong grassroots movements sprung up during the latter half of the 19th century (unions, temperance groups, and independent religious groups). They were all based on democratic principles and built a strong base for Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of [[World War I]]. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the century, people gradually began moving into [[Cities of Sweden|cities]] to work in [[factory|factories]], and became involved in [[Socialist]] [[trade union|unions]]. A [[Socialist]] [[revolution]] was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[Parliamentarism]], and the country was [[democratization|democratized]].

By the 1930s Sweden had achieved one of Europe's highest living standards.

[[Swedish neutrality|Sweden remained neutral]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed, as it made concessions to both sides during the war. (''See further [[Sweden during World War II]]'')

Following the war, Sweden took advantage of its natural resources and lack of war damage, making it possible to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe, leading it to be one of the richest countries in the world by 1960. Sweden was part of the [[Marshall Plan]] but continued to stay non-aligned during the [[Cold War]], and is still not a member of any [[military alliance]]. During most of the post-war era, the country was ruled by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] that established a [[welfare state]], striving for a "well being for all"-policy. Following a recession in the early 1990s some socialist policies were relaxed. Sweden, despite its officially neutral stance, joined the [[European Union]] in 1995, arguing that neutrality was less important in the post-Cold War world. However, in a 2003 consultative referendum, Swedish citizens declined to adopt the [[Euro]].

As other economies were re-established, Sweden was surpassed in the 1970s and had to adjust its politics in the 1990s; however, it still ranks among the top nations in terms of [[standard of living]].

Sweden has had two political murders in recent history. Prime-Minister [[Olof Palme]] in 1986, and foreign-minister [[Anna Lindh]] in 2003.

Sweden enjoys a mostly [[temperate climate]] despite its northern [[latitude]], mainly due to the [[Gulf Stream]]. In the south of Sweden leaf-bearing [[tree]]s are prolific, in the north [[pine]]s, [[spruce]]s and hardy [[birch]]es dominate the landscape. In the mountains of northern Sweden a sub-Arctic climate predominates. North of the [[Arctic Circle]], the sun never sets for part of each summer, and in the winter, night is unending for a corresponding period. The country is similar in size to the U.S. state of California, and has roughly three times the population of the city of Los Angeles.

East of Sweden lies the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], providing a long coastline, and mellowing the climate further yet. To the west is the [[Scandinavian mountain chain]], a range that separates Sweden from [[Norway]].

The southern part of the country is predominantly agricultural, with forests covering a larger percentage of the land the further north one goes. Population density is also higher in southern Sweden, with centres being in the valley of lake [[Mälaren]] and the [[Öresund]] region.

[[Gotland]] and [[Öland]] are the largest [[islands of Sweden]].

=== Counties ===
{{details|Counties of Sweden}}

Sweden is divided into 21 [[county|counties]] or ''[[län]]''. They are [[Stockholm County]],
[[Uppsala County]],
[[Södermanland County]],
[[Östergötland County]],
[[Jönköping County]],
[[Kronoberg County]],
[[Kalmar County]],
[[Gotland County]],
[[Blekinge County]],
[[Skåne County]],
[[Halland County]],
[[Västra Götaland County]],
[[Värmland County]],
[[Örebro County]],
[[Västmanland County]],
[[Dalarna County]],
[[Gävleborg County]],
[[Västernorrland County]],
[[Jämtland County]],
[[Västerbotten County]] and
[[Norrbotten County]].

Each has a [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] or ''länsstyrelse'' which is appointed by the Government. In each county there is also a separate [[County Councils of Sweden|County Council]] or ''landsting'', which is the municipal representation appointed by the county electorate. Each county further divides into a number of [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] or ''kommuner'', making a total of 290 municipalities, in 2004. There are also older historical divisions of Sweden, primarily into the 25 [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] and three [[Lands of Sweden|lands]]. These divisions are still significant.

== Demographics ==
{{details|Demographics of Sweden}}
Sweden has one of the world's highest [[life expectancies]]. As of approximately [[August 12]] [[2004]], the total population of Sweden for the first time exceeded 9,000,000, according to the [[Statistics Sweden|SCB]]. As of February 2006, the population was 9,060,430<ref>[http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____25897.aspx Swedish Statistical Agency statistics]</ref>. About 86.7% of the population is [[Ethnic Swedes|ethnic Swedish]]. The largest non-ethnically Swedish groups are the [[ethnic Finns|Finns]], who make up about 2% of the population. Other significant ethnic groups are from the other [[Scandinavian]] countries, the [[former Yugoslavia]], and the [[Middle East]]. An additional group that has a strong say based on tradition is the [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Sami people]], living in northern Sweden and amounting to about 17,000 people.

Sweden has been transformed from a nation of [[emigration]] ending after [[World War I]] to a nation of [[immigration]] from [[World War II]] onwards. Currently, almost 12% of the residents are born abroad, and about one fifth of Sweden's population are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. The largest immigrant groups are from [[Finland]], the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], [[Iraq]] and then other [[Nordic Countries]], in that order. This reflects the inter-Nordic migrations, earlier periods of labour immigration, and later decades of refugee and family immigration.

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intervention against the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and the [[Prague Spring|1968 Czechoslovak liberalization]] resulted in the first surges of intellectual [[political refugee]]s. Some [[United States|American]] deserters from the [[Vietnam War]] also found refuge among the Swedes, who in international politics took a clear stand against what they typically viewed as [[imperialism]] executed by both the Soviet Union and the United States of America. After the [[1973 coup in Chile]], and the following military dictatorships in [[Chile]] and other [[South America]]n countries, political refugees came to dominate the image of immigration to Sweden, including refugees from [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] and [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]].

{{details|Swedish language}}
Swedish is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], related and very similar to to [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but differing in pronunciation and [[orthography]]. Sweden has no [[official language]] but Swedish holds a [[de facto]] status as such. The dominant language has always been Swedish and there has previously never been a political need to make it an [[official language]]. However, with the recognition of five [[minority languages of Sweden]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Meänkieli]], [[Sami languages|Sami]], [[Romany language|Romani]] and [[Yiddish]]) on [[April 1]], [[2000]], the issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language was raised. On [[December 7]], [[2005]], the parliament voted on this issue, but with a count of 147 to 145 due to voting errors by some members of parliament the proposal to make Swedish the official language failed. It was, however, strengthened as the principal language in that same proposal.

A majority of Swedes, especially those under 60, are able to understand and speak [[English language|English]] thanks to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of [[Subtitle|subtitling]] rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films. English became a compulsory subject for [[Secondary education|secondary school]] students studying [[natural science]]s as early as 1849 and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s <ref>[http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_07_99/01_engelska.html Article about Swedes' knowledge of English in the Lund University newsletter 7/1999 - in Swedish]</ref>. Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject from [[third grade|third]] until [[ninth grade]], and all students continuing in secondary school study English for at least another year. Most students also learn one and sometimes two additional languages; the most popular being [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].

Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, in which King Carl XVI Gustaf is head of state, but royal power has long been limited to official and ceremonial functions.

The nation's legislature is the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag), with 349 members. Parliamentary elections are held every four years.

[[دوتنه:Riksdagen-fran-vattnet-2004-05-09.jpg|thumb|220px|The Riksdag in Stockholm]]
[[دوتنه:Sveriges riksdag 2001 a.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Inside the Riksdag]]

Legislation may be initiated by the [[Government of Sweden|Cabinet]] or by members of Parliament. Members are elected on the basis of [[proportional representation]] for a four-year term. The [[Constitution of Sweden]] can be altered by the Riksdag, which requires a [[supermajority]] and confirmation after the following general elections. Sweden has three other constitutional laws: the [[Act of Royal Succession]], the [[Freedom of Press Act]] and the [[Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression]].

The [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] has played a leading political role since 1917, after [[Reformist]]s had confirmed their strength and the [[Left Party (Sweden)|revolutionaries]] left the party. After 1932, the [[Government of Sweden|Cabinets]] have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only three general elections (1976,1979 and 1991) have given the centre-right bloc enough seats in Parliament to form a government. It is considered the reason for the Swedish post-war [[welfare state]], with a government expenditure of slightly more than 50% of the [[gross domestic product]].

In May 2006, the following political parties held seats in the Riksdag (the most recent elections were held in September 2002; the next elections will be held in [[Sweden general election, 2006|September 2006]]):
* [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Socialdemokraterna]] (s, Social Democrats): 144 seats, 39.8% of votes
* [[Moderate Party|Moderaterna]] (m, Moderates): 55 seats, 15.2% of votes
* [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Folkpartiet liberalerna]] (fp, Liberal Party): 48 seats, 13.3% of votes
* [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Kristdemokraterna]] (kd, Christian Democrats): 33 seats, 9.1% of votes
* [[Left Party (Sweden)|Vänsterpartiet]] (v, Left Party): 28 seats, 8.3% of votes
* [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centerpartiet]] (c, Centre Party): 22 seats, 6.1% of votes
* [[Green Party (Sweden)|Miljöpartiet]] (mp, Greens): 17 seats, 4.6% of votes
(There are also 2 members of parliament who have left their respective parties during this term and are therefore not counted above.)

Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its "popular movements" ([[Folkrörelser]] in Swedish), the most notable being [[trade unions]], the [[women's movement]], the [[temperance movement]], and -- more recently -- [[sports movement]]. Election turnout in Sweden has always been high in international comparisons, although it has declined in recent decades, and is currently around 80 percent (80.11 in [[Sweden general election, 2002]]).

Some Swedish political figures that have become known worldwide include [[Joe Hill]], [[Carl Skoglund]], [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Folke Bernadotte]], [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], [[Olof Palme]], [[Carl Bildt]], [[Hans Blix]], and [[Anna Lindh]].

{{details|Nuclear power phase-out#Sweden}}

After the [[1973 oil crisis]], the [[energy]] politics were determined to become less dependent on the import of [[petroleum]]. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from [[hydropower]] and nuclear power. Sweden wants to be independent of petroleum use by 2020. Accidents at the [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] ([[USA]]) prompted the [[Swedish parliament]] in 1980 after a [[referendum]] to decide that no further nuclear power plants should be built and that a [[nuclear power phase-out]] should be completed by 2010. [[As of 2005]], the use of [[renewable energy|renewables]] amounted to 26% of the energy supply in Sweden, most important being [[hydroelectricity|hydropower]] and [[biomass]]. In 2003, electricity from hydropower accounted for 53 [[TWh]] and 40% of the country's production of [[electricity]] with nuclear power delivering 65 TWh (49%). At the same time, the use of [[biofuel]]s, [[peat]] etc. produced 13 TWh of electricity <ref>[http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____24270.aspx SCB figures about energy production and usage 1994-2003 - in Swedish]</ref>.

In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power <ref>[http://www.uic.com.au/nip39.htm "Nuclear Power in Sweden" - Uranium Information Centre, Australia]</ref>. Since then however, reports about radioactive leakages at a nuclear waste store in Forsmark, Sweden, have been published # <ref>[http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/06/29/afx2116521.html "Swedish nuclear power station leaks high levels of radioactive waste into Baltic" - Forbes June 29, 2005]</ref>. This doesn't seem to have changed the public support of continued use of nuclear power.

Sweden decided to phase out nuclear fission before 2020, although it is very unlikely that this will happen.

Throughout the 20th century, [[Swedish foreign policy]] was based on the principle of [[non-alignment]] in peacetime, [[neutrality]] in wartime.

During [[Cold War]] era politics, Sweden was not under the [[Warsaw Pact]] and received only minimal aid from the [[Marshall Plan]]. Sweden was also known to be the first western nation to detect unusually high [[radiation]] levels in the atmosphere, which later was confirmed to have been the residual nuclear fallout from the [[Chernobyl]] accident. However, a Swedish [[DC-3]] was [[Catalina affair|shot down]] over the Baltic sea. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for the [[NATO]]. Another plane, a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[search and rescue]] craft, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well.

Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the [[European Union]], and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security cooperation as well.

Sweden is also very active in international peace efforts, especially through the [[United Nations]], and in support to the [[Third World]].

{{main|د سويډن اقتصاد}}
The standard of living has become markedly high under Sweden's social democratic system. The economy features a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labour force. [[Timber]], [[hydropower]], and [[iron ore]] constitute the resource base of an [[Economics|economy]] heavily oriented toward [[foreign trade]].

The engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. The public and the trade union controlled pension funds, non-profit organizations and the reserve funds of the trade-unions own more than 50% of Swedish capital. 80% of the workforce is organized through the trade-unions. The public sector accounts for 53% of the GDP. 
Trade unions have the right to elect two representatives to the board in all Swedish companies with more than 25 employees.<!-- Source: http://www.samhallsguiden.riksdagen.se/sg-295.asp#P1687_231108 --> [[Agriculture]] accounts for only 2% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] and 2% of the jobs. The [[Government of Sweden|government's]] commitment to fiscal discipline resulted in a substantial budgetary surplus in 2001, which was cut by more than half in 2002, due to the global economic slowdown, revenue declines, and spending increases. The Swedish [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]] is focusing on price stability with its inflation target of 2%. Growth is expected to reach 3.3% in 2006, assuming a continued global recovery. Swedish unemployment figures are highly contested with the social-democratic government claiming that the figure is 5.6% and the opposition claiming it is much higher. The official statistics on unemployment is 5.6% for 2004 these numbers do not however include unemployed people in government programs, people on extended sick-leave and people in different welfare programs. Unemployment is thought to be closer to 11% when using a system of measurement similar to that of other European nations and the United States. Sweden is known for having an even distribution of income, with a [[Gini coefficient]] at 0.21 in 2001 (one of the most even income distributions in the industrialized world).

=== Welfare state ===
:{{see|Social welfare in Sweden}}
What is known as the [[Scandinavian model]] is usually described as a middle way between [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]].

The state provides for tax-funded [[childcare]], parental leave, a ceiling on health care costs, tax-funded education (all levels up to, and including university), retirement pensions, tax-funded dental care up to 20 years of age and sick leave (partly paid by the employer). Parents are entitled to a total of 480 days partly paid leave between birth and the child's eighth birthday, with 60 days reserved specifically for each parent, in effect providing the father with two so called "daddy-months". In addition, the ceiling on health care costs makes it easier, relative to other nations, for Swedish workers to take time off for medical reasons.

The Swedish welfare system remains generous, but a recession in the 1990s forced an introduction of a number of reforms, such as [[education voucher]]s in 1992 and decentralisation of some types of healthcare services to municipal control <ref>[http://fcpp.org/main/publication_detail.php?PubID=814 "Law of the Labour Back Benches" - New Statesman September 6, 2004]</ref>.

The welfare state requires high taxes. Sweden has a two step [[progressive tax]] scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20-25% when a salary exceeds roughly 300 000 SEK per year. The employing company pays an additional 32% of so called Employers fee. In addition, a national [[Value added tax|VAT]] of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens except food (12% VAT) and transports and books (6% VAT). Certain items are taxed at higher rates, e.g. petrol/diesel, new cars and alcoholic beverages.

=== زده کړې ===
{{main|Education in Sweden}}

As part of its social welfare system, Sweden provides an extensive [[childcare]] system that guarantees a place for all young children from 1-5 years old in a public day-care facility. Between ages 6-16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. After completing the ninth grade, 90% continue with a three year upper secondary school leading sometimes to a vocational diploma and always to the qualifications for further studies at a [[List of universities in Sweden|university or university college (''högskola'')]].

== مذهب ==
{{main|Church of Sweden}}{{main|د سويډن مذهب}}


After the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1530s the Church and State were united, abolishing the authority of the Roman Catholic bishops, and in the long run allowed only [[Lutheranism]] to prevail. This process was not completed until the [[Uppsala Synod 1593]]. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of [[Lutheran Orthodoxy]], in the 17th century, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]] and [[Walloon]]s who played a significant role in trade and industry, were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile. The [[Sami people|Sami]] originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Not until liberalization in the late 18th century, were believers of other faiths, including [[Judaism]] and [[Catholicism]], allowed to openly live and work in Sweden, although it remained illegal until 1860 for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century [[secularism]] began attracting attention, leading people to distance themselves from Church rituals. Leaving the [[Church of Sweden]] became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was established in the Law on Freedom of Religion in 1951. Today about 78% of Swedes belong to the Church of Sweden, but the number is decreasing by about one percent every year, and Church of Sweden services are sparsely attended (hovering in the single digit percentages of the population)<ref>[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/ Church of Sweden], [http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik/pdf/medlemmar.pdf Members 1978-2004, PDF document in Swedish]</ref>. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and, in addition, [[immigration]] has meant that there are now some 92,000 [[Roman Catholics]] and 100,000 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] living in Sweden <ref>[http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frikyrka Statistics about free churches and immigration churches from Swedish Wikipedia - in Swedish]</ref>. Also of significance are the 200,000 to 400,000 [[Islam in Sweden|Muslims]] in Sweden.<ref>[http://www.islamiska.org/s/sverige.htm Swedish Muslim Association - in Swedish]</ref>.

According to the most recent Eurostat "Eurobarometer" poll, in 2005 <ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurostat poll on the social and religious beliefs of Europeans Eurobarometer,] ([[PDF]] format)</ref>, only 23% of Swedish citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", whereas 53% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 23% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force". This, according to the survey, would make Swedes the third least spiritual people in the 25-member [[European Union]].

{{main|د سويډن کلتور/فرهنگ}}
Swedish authors of worldwide recognition include [[Henning Mankell]], [[Carolus Linnaeus]] (the father of botany), [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Selma Lagerlöf]], [[Vilhelm Moberg]], [[Harry Martinson]] and [[Astrid Lindgren]], the author of the beloved [[Pippi Longstocking]] books.

Sweden's most well-known artists are painters [[Carl Larsson]], [[Anders Zorn]], and [[Alexander Roslin]], and the sculptors [[Tobias Sergel]] and [[Carl Milles]].

Many well-known inventions and discoveries, historical and modern, were made by Swedes. Some notable figures are [[Alfred Nobel]], [[Anders Celsius]], [[Baltzar von Platen]], [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], [[John Ericsson]], [[Anders Jonas Ångström]], [[Lars Magnus Ericsson]], [[Svante Arrhenius]], [[Arvid Carlsson]], [[Håkan Lans]].

Swedish 20th century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with [[Mauritz Stiller]] and [[Victor Sjöström]]. In the 1920s–1980s, the filmmakers [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Bo Widerberg]] received [[Academy Awards]], and actresses [[Greta Garbo]], [[Ingrid Bergman]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Lena Olin]], [[Zarah Leander]], and [[Anita Ekberg]] made careers abroad. The actors [[Max von Sydow]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]], and [[Peter Stormare]] are also worth mentioning. More recently, the films of [[Lukas Moodysson]] and [[Lasse Hallström]] have received international recognition.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Sweden was an international leader in what is now referred to as the "[[sexual revolution]]," with gender equality particularly promoted.

[[دوتنه:Ebbaflagga12.jpg|thumb|none|200px|right|[[Ebba Grön]], early Swedish punk band]]
The best-known [[opera]] singers are the 19th century [[soprano]] [[Jenny Lind]] and the 20th century [[tenor]] [[Jussi Björling]], who had great success abroad. Björling is considered by many to be the epitome of a great tenor. Also [[soprano]]s [[Christina Nilsson]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], and [[tenor]] [[Nicolai Gedda]], [[baritone]] [[Håkan Hagegård]] and the contemporary [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Anne-Sofie von Otter]] have become known in the world of opera.

Some of the most successful Swedish popular music artists are [[ABBA]],[[Carola]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Roxette]], [[Ace of Base]], [[Army of Lovers]], [[Robyn]], [[A*Teens]], [[The Cardigans]], and guitarist [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen|Yngwie Malmsteen]]. A number of bands with less emphasis on pop music have come out of the country in recent years, including [[Eskobar]], [[Clawfinger]], [[The Hives]], [[Millencolin]], [[Sahara Hotnights]], [[The Hellacopters]], [[Kent (band)|Kent]], [[Infinite Mass]], and [[Looptroop]]. In underground circles, Sweden is known for a large number of [[heavy metal]] (mostly [[death metal]] and [[melodic death metal]]), as well as [[progressive music|Progressive]] bands. Prominent metal acts include [[Opeth]], [[Arch Enemy (band)|Arch Enemy]], [[Blindside]], [[Jerusalem]], [[In Flames]], [[Meshuggah]], [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], [[Amon Amarth (band)|Amon Amarth]], [[Vintersorg]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]], [[The Haunted]], and [[At the Gates]]. In the synth world, the band [[S.P.O.C.K]] is still active after 18 years. Sweden is also responsible for the Swechno scene, offering a distinct house and techno sound, of which artists like [[Adam Beyer]] is famous. More recently, the so-called Swedish House Mafia including [[Steve Angello]], Sebastian Ingrosso, [[Axwell]], and [[Eric Prydz]] have topped the house music charts and DJ top 10s around the world. Also worth mentioning is [[Joakim Thåström]] and his punk band [[Ebba Grön]].  Sweden is also home to several influential [[emo]] and [[hardcore punk]] bands, such as [[Fireside (band)|Fireside]], [[Refused]], [[The Last Days Of April]], and [[Kelly 8]].

{{details|Media in Sweden}}
Swedes are among the greatest consumers of [[newspaper]]s in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are [[Dagens Nyheter]] (liberal), [[Göteborgs-Posten]] (liberal), [[Svenska Dagbladet]] (conservative) and [[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]] (liberal). The two largest evening [[tabloid]]s are [[Aftonbladet]] (social democratic) and [[Expressen]] (centrist). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, [[Metro International]], was originally founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by [[The Local]].

For many years Swedish [[television]] consisted solely of the two channels broadcast by the public service company [[Sveriges Television]], which, as in most other European countries, is financed through a [[TV license|radio and TV license]]. In 1987 the first commercial Scandinavian channel, [[TV3 (Viasat)|TV3]], started transmitting from London, and today there are five free broadcast channels in the [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial network]], which is currently switching from [[Analog television|analogue]] to [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]], However, most Swedes have access to numerous other free and pay channels through [[cable TV|cable]] or [[satellite TV]].

{{details|Holidays in Sweden}}
[[دوتنه:Midsommardans av Anders Zorn 1897.jpg|thumb|none|200px|right|Midsummer's Eve, painting by [[Anders Zorn]]]]
Apart from traditional Protestant [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]], Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include [[Midsummer]], celebrating the [[summer solstice]]; [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]] lighting bonfires; [[Labour Day]] on [[May 1]] is dedicated to socialist demonstrations; and [[December 13]], the day of [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]] the lightgiver. [[June 6]] is [[National holiday of Sweden|National Day of Sweden]] and as of 2005 a public holiday. Furthermore, there are [[Flag days in Sweden|official flag day]] observances and a [[Namesdays in Sweden]] calendar. In August many Swedes have kräftskivor (crayfish parties). More regional variants are the surströmming parties in Northern Sweden (surströmming is a type of fermented fish), and ålegillar (eel parties) in Skåne. The [[Sami people|Sami]], one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on February 6th.

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Swedish cuisine}}
Swedish cuisine, like that of the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries ([[Cuisine of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]]), is traditionally simple. [[Fish]], [[meat]] and [[potatoes]] play prominent roles. Spices are sparse. Famous dishes include Swedish meatballs (köttbullar—traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and lingonberry jam), plättar (Swedish pancakes, served with jam), [[lutefisk|lutfisk]], the smörgås (open-faced sandwich), and the famous '[[Smörgåsbord]]'.

== ورزښت ==
{{main|Sport in Sweden}}

Sport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating. The two main spectator sports are [[football (soccer)]] and [[ice hockey]]. Some notable Swedish football stars include [[Zlatan Ibrahimovic]], [[Henrik Larsson]] and [[Fredrik Ljungberg]]. Swedish hockey players have often been regarded as some of the best in their sport. Famous Swedish hockey players include: [[Bengt-Åke Gustafsson]], [[Håkan Loob]], [[Peter Forsberg]], [[Markus Näslund]], [[Mats Sundin]], [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Nicklas Lidström]], [[Tomas Holmström]], [[Daniel Sedin]], [[Henrik Sedin]], [[Börje Salming]], [[Mattias Norström]], [[Tomas Sandström]], [[Pelle Lindbergh]] and [[Henrik Lundqvist]].

Second to football, [[Horse#Horses in sport today|horse sports]] have the highest number of practitioners, mostly women. Thereafter follow [[golf]], [[track and field]], and the [[team sport]]s of [[handball]], [[floorball]], [[basketball]] and [[bandy]]. American sports such as [[baseball]] and [[American football]] are also practised but have no widespread popularity.

Successful [[tennis]] players include former world No. 1's [[Björn Borg]], [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Stefan Edberg]]; in [[skiing]] sports, [[Ingemar Stenmark]], [[Pernilla Wiberg]] and [[Anja Pärson]] have all had dominating periods in [[alpine skiing]], as have [[Sixten Jernberg]], [[Gunde Svan]], [[Per Elofsson]] and [[Thomas Wassberg]] in [[cross country skiing|cross country]] skiing. In [[ski jumping]], [[Jan Boklöv]] revolutionised the sport with his new technique, the V-style.

A number of Swedes have been internationally successful in [[athletics]]. In the 1940s runner [[Gunder Hägg]] dominated [[Middle distance track event|middle distance]]. In recent years, stars include [[high jump]]ers such as the European record holder [[Patrik Sjöberg]], [[Kajsa Bergqvist]], and Athens Olympic gold medallist [[Stefan Holm]]. Two other Swedish athletes won gold medals in the [[2004 Olympic Games]]: [[heptathlon|heptathlete]] [[Carolina Klüft]] and [[triple jump]]er [[Christian Olsson]].

Other famous Swedish athletes include the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion [[Ingemar Johansson]], [[golf]]er [[Annika Sörenstam]], former five times World [[table tennis]] Champion [[Jan-Ove Waldner]] and the World Speedway Champion [[Tony Rickardsson]].

Professional [[Skateboarding|skateboarders]] include [[Pontus Alv]], [[Matthias Ringström]], and Tony Magnuson. In schools, on meadows and in parks, the game [[brännboll]], a sport similar to [[baseball]], is commonly played for fun. Other leisure sports are the historical game of [[kubb]] and [[boules]] among the older generation.
