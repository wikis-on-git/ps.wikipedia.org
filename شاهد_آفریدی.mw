'''Sahibzada Mohammad Shahid Khan Afridi''' (born [[March 1]], [[1980]] in [[Mardan]] to [[Pashtun]] parents of the [[Afridi]] tribe) popularly known as '''Shahid Afridi''' is a Pakistani [[cricketer]] who has represented Pakistan since [[1996]] in international [[cricket]]. He made his [[One-day_International|ODI]] debut on [[October 2]], [[1996]] against [[Kenya]] at [[Nairobi]] and his [[Test_cricket|Test]] debut on [[October 22]], [[1998]] against [[Australia]] at [[Karachi]]. He has scored over 4,500 ODI runs at a [[Cricket_statistics#Batting_statistics|strike rate]] of more than 107 runs per 100 balls, and has taken over 160 ODI wickets. He was brought into the team as a legspinner at the age of sixteen as a replacement for the injured [[Mushtaq Ahmed]]. He then gained fame as a pinch-hitter and began opening with Saeed Anwar. He holds the record for scoring the fastest century (which he scored off 37 balls) in One Day Internationals. He also shares the record for the second fastest century (off 45 balls) in One Day Internationals with [[Brian Lara]]. One of Pakistan's most useful all rounders, his extremely aggressive batting style has ensured that he has a strike rate higher than most batsman in the world though his average of around 25 underlines the inconsistency in his batting.

A propensity for the unexpected, and a reputation for lacking patience while batting has meant that he has never been able to command a regular place in the Pakistan side -  "There are more brains in a chocolate mouse" , [[Geoff Boycott]] once said in respect of Afridi's approach! However, in the two games between Pakistan and India, contested in 2005, that he participated in, Afridi made his presence felt, almost recording the fastest Test half-century, and dismissing Indian legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] three times, in helping [[Pakistan]] register an unlikely draw.
He currently has the best [[strike rate]] in ODIs, and also the record for most number of 6s in ODIs (214) and most 6s in an innings (11). But nowadays his presence in the team is more for his useful bowling than his batting: his spin bowling includes the off break, leg-break and the quicker one which he can throw at nearly 80 mph hence his ability to remove the tail of the batting side.
His batting is suspect in bouncy pitches and against opponents like [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] but remains a good opener in sub-continent pitches where he stars and is a thorough entertainer.

Afridi has been consistent with his batting and bowling throughout 2005 starting from the Indian tour to the West Indies and England tour. The new Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer has helped Afridi in reaching full potential by improving his shot selection and giving him a free reign over his batting attitude. Since his return to the Pakitan team he has been a regular member despite the competition from Shoaib Malik, and Abdul Razaq.

On [[21 November]] [[2005]], Shahid Afridi was banned for a Test match and two one-day internationals for deliberately damaging the pitch in the second match of the three-[[Test cricket|Test]] series against England. TV cameras pictured him scraping his boots on the [[pitch (cricket)|pitch]] surface when play was held up after a gas canister exploded. Afridi later pleaded guilty to a level three breach of the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] code of conduct relating to the spirit of the game. Inquiries were made and Afridi's antics came into view. He was investigated and banned with commendable speed, along with receiving a huge amount of criticism from the cricketing world for bringing the game into disrepute. 
Match referee [[Roshan Mahanama]] said: "This ban should serve as a message to players that this type of behaviour is not allowed."  His behaviour was also condemned by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
