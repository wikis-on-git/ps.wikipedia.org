ډاکټر ابولفقير زين العابدين عبدالکلام''' ([[تاميلي ژبه|تاميل]]: அ.ப.ஜ. அப்துல் கலாம்; هندي: अवुल् फ़किर् ज़य्नुल् अबिदीन् अब्दुल् क़लाम;''' په ١٥ د اکتوبر، ١٩٣١ کال کې د هندوستان په [[تاميل ندو]] کې زېږېدلی دی. نوموړی چې په لنډه توګه د '''A.P.J. Abdul Kalam''' په نامه سره هم يادېږي د هندوستان ولسمشر دی. د ولسمشرۍ سره سره هغه يو ډېر نوميالی ساينسپوه او انجنير دی چې د خلکو په مېنځ کې د هندوستان توغوندی سړی يا the Missile Man of India په نامه هم يادېږي.

== کاري ژوند ==

عبدالکلام د تاميل ندو په رامسوارام دهنوشکودي کې په يوې کاريګرې مسلمانې کورنۍ کې زېږېدلی. هغه خپل بری ليک د اېروناټېکل انجنيرۍ کې د مدراس تخنيکي انسټېټيوټ نه په ١٩٥٨ کال کې ترلاسه کړی. د فراغت نه وروسته نوموړی د هندوستان د دفاع څېړنيز او پرمختيايي تنظيم کې د هوورکرافټ پروژې کې د کار لپاره وګومارل شو. په ١٩٦٢ کال کې عبدالکلام د هندوستان هوايي څېړنيز تنظيم ته ولاړ او د مصنوعي سپوږمکيو په جوړولو او توغولو کې يې کاميابه ونډه درلوده. 

د هندوستان د لومړنۍ سپوږمکۍ د توغولو ګاډۍ (Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (SLV-III]] پروژه کې د لارښود په توګه ده ډېره اهمه ونډه درلوده او په کاميابۍ سره يې دا پروژه سرته ورسوله، او همداسې د جولای په مياشت، کال ١٩٨٠ کې د روهيني سپوږمکۍ د زمکۍ نژدې مدار کې د ځای پر ځای کولو کاميابه کړنه هم دده له برکته وه.

په ١٩٨٢ کال کې يو ځل بيا عبدالکلام د هندوستان د دفاع څېړنيز او پرمختيايي تنظيم ته د لارښود په توګه راستون شو، او دا ځل يې د توغنديو په جوړولو غور وکړ. هغه د آګني او پرېتوي نومي توغنديو د پرمختګ او اداره کولو مسول وه او همدا ددې سبب وګرځېده چې د ښه کار په پايله کې د هندوستان د توغندي سړي نوم ورکړ شو.

د ١٩٩٢ کال د جولای په مياشت کې عبدالکلام د هندوستان د دفاع وزارت ساينسي سلاکار شو. د هندوستان د حکومت د اهم ساينسي سلاکار په توګه د وزيرانو د کابينې په رتبه کې پاتې شو. د هغه کارونه ددې لامل وه چې هندوستان د لومړي ځل لپاره په ١٩٩٨ کال کې د [[پوخران-II]] کاميابه [[هستوي ازمېينه]] ترسره کړه او په همدې توګه هندوستان د نړۍ د هستوي وسلو په هېوادونو کې وشمېرل شو. ډاکټر کلام د کابينې د ساينسي کوميټې سلاکارانو مشر هم پاتې شوی او د هندوستان د ميلېنيم مېشن ٢٠٢٠ يا د زرکلنې مقصد ٢٠٢٠ لارښوونه يې هم کړې.

ډاکټر عبدالکلام د اکاډميکو زده کړو پسې روان شو او په [[آنا پوهنتون]]، [[چېنای]] کې د ٢٠٠١ کال د نومبر د مياشتې نه د تخنيک او ټولنيز بدلونونو [[پروفېسر]] شو او په همدې توګه د درس ورکولو سره سره په ډېرو څېړنيزو کارونو باندې بوخت وه. په هر صورت دده ترټولو غوره او اصلي مقصد دا وه چې د هېواد د لا پرمختګ لپاره د ځوانانو په ماغزو کې ډيوې بلې کړي او هغوی وروزي.

اوس ډاکټر کلام هندوستان د يوولسم ولسمشر دی او د ٢٠٠٢ کال د جولای د ٢٥ نېټې راهيسې پخپلې دندې بوخت دی.

== ستاينې ==

ډاکټر عبدالکلام يو بې جوړې سړی دی چا چې تر اوسه پورې د دېرشو پوهنتونونو نه دوکتوراګانې ترلاسه کړي دي او په همدې توګه د هندوستان درې لويې ملکي جايزې هم ترلاسه کړي. د پدما بهوشان جايزه يې په ١٩٨١ کال کې ترلاسه کړه، د پدما وبهوشان جايزه يې په ١٩٩٠ کال کې او په هندوستان کې تر ټولو لويه ملکي جايزه چې د هېواد کې د اعلی چوپړ په پايله کې ورکول کېږي د بهارت راټنا جايزه ده چې نوموړي په کال ١٩٩٧ کې لاس ته راوړه. پدې لنډو وختونو کې يې د يو بل پوهنتون نه د ستاينزي دوکتورا د اخيستلو نه لاس په سر شو او دا ادعا يې لرله چې دی د همدومره لاس ته راوړنو نه ډېر راضي دی چې په ژوند کې د ډېر زيار په ګاللو ور په برخه شوي.

== سياسي اندونه ==
Something of Kalam's probable views on certain issues can be surmised from positions espoused by him in the past. His book "[[India 2020]]" strongly advocates an action plan to develop India into a knowledge [[superpower]] and into a [[developed nation]] by the year [[2020]]. Kalam is credited with the view that [[India]] ought to take a more assertive stance in international relations; he apparently regards his work on India's [[nuclear weapon]]s program as a way to assert India's place as a future [[superpower]]. 

Kalam continues to take an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology as well. He has proposed a research programme to increase intelligence using [[bio-implants]]. He is a supporter of [[Open source]] [[software]] over proprietary solutions and believes that the use of open source software on a large scale will bring more people the benefits of [[information technology]].

== Criticism ==
Kalam has been the subject of vicious criticism from leftists in the Indian press, [http://antiwar.com/bidwai/?articleid=592], Praful Bidwai being among his staunchest critics. In popular forums on the web such as this one [http://satribune.com/thread.jsp?forum=3&thread=901&message=20082] Kalam has been derided for his appearance and his perceived closeness to the earlier Bharatiya Janata Party led administration.

He has also been widely criticized for giving his assent for the dissolution of Bihar assembly in the middle of the night without holding any serious discussions with legal experts. During the recent Controversy of reservations in Central government funded universities and colleges in India, it was alleged that he acted no more than a mute spectator and could have played a more active role.

This can be attributed to the limited power that the Constitution of the Country confers on the President. Under the Indian constitution, President can either give his consent to a bill or send the Bill back to the Lok Sabha for review in accordance with Section 111 of the Constitution. In case Lok Sabha again sends the Bill to the President, the president has no other option but to give his consent. Under the limitation that the President works, the majority opinion is that A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is doing a good job in the present circumstances.

== Identity ==

[[دوتنه:APJ Abdul Kalam's Family.JPG|کيڼ|300px|بټنوک|All the President's kin]]

As a rule Muslim industry leaders, scholars, and politicians who have made a name for themselves in India and Pakistan have been from the elite classes of their community, such as the Kutchi Memons, the Bohras, or the wealthy families of Hyderabad and Lucknow. Kalam is the first Muslim from Southern India from a Muslim community that does not speak Urdu to have achieved the kind of recognition he has. His idea of India's interests is modernist and nationalistic. This stands in contrast to the articulation of India's interests by different groups across India's political spectrum. The Congress and its related formations derive their idea of national interest from the ideas expressed by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, that sees India as an historic entity that must stand at the forefront of nations that have won their independence during the 20th century from colonial powers and are trying to create societies with regulated economic systems. The communist parties of India and its allies see India as an entity of the 20th century and a temporary creation of the current capitalist phase of human society that should some day be a part of a worldwide classless and nationless socialist economy that is the final and inevitable endpoint of human progress. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party sees India as an entity inspired by its Hindu heritage that is required to recapture its once glorious position on the world stage, with its current structure of a Nation State being a modern requirement. Kalam's views are inspired partly by Nehru's ideas and those articulated by Hindu nationalists and he attempts to draw the best from both. While rejecting Nehru's role for India as a spokesperson of other nations with perceived common interests, his views also reject the Hindu nationalist idea of a national identity based on a religious heritage. Kalam point of view however makes no room whatsoever for the Indian left's idea of India. This may be a reason why leftists journalists in India have criticized him. Kalam's belief in the power of technology to resolve society's problems and his views of these problems as a result of inefficient distribution of resources is modernistic. He also sees science and technology as ideology free areas and emphasizes the cultivation of a scientific temper and an entrepreneurial drive. In this he finds much support among India's new economy business leaders some of whom especially the founders of Infosys have begun their career as technology professionals much in the same way as Kalam has.


== شخصي ژوند ==
Kalam observes strict personal discipline, practicing [[vegetarianism]], [[teetotalism]] and [[celibacy]]. Kalam is a scholar of [[Tirukkural]]; in most of his speeches, he quotes at least one [[kural|''kural'']].
It is believed that he reads both the [[Qur'an]] (the main holy text of his family's faith, [[Islam]]) regularly and also the [[Bhagavad Gita]] at times. 
Kalam has written several inspirational books, most notably his autobiography ''[[Wings of Fire]]'', aimed at motivating Indian youth. Another of his books, ''''[[Guiding Souls: Dialogues on the Purpose of Life]]'' reveals his spiritual side.

== کلام، هغه ليکوال چې سوېلي کوريايان يې ځان پلو راښکلي دي ==

Books written by President A P J Abdul Kalam have captured the interest of the South Korean youth, if an offer made by a professor of this country to translate his latest book "Guiding Souls" into Korean is any indication. 

Dr Ok Jung Lee, the 51-year-old professor of Sociology in the Catholic University at Daegu, met Kalam and the book's co-author Prof Arun K Tiwari on Tuesday night and offered to translate "Guiding Souls", just a year after she had translated Kalam's previous book "Wings of Fire". 

Kalam, whose power point presentations on impact of science on a nation's life, has charmed South Koreans, has consented to the offer by Dr Lee. 

Asked what special traits she found in the Indian President to translate two books in as many years, Lee said Kalam has emerged as "the guiding soul of Korean youth" and "Wings of Fire" made a "profound impact" since its publication which is reflected in its good sale in the areas around Universities." 

When Kalam asked Lee what could be the reason behind the popularity of "Wings of Fire" in Korea, she replied "Your book has provided a new perspective of patience and generosity to Korean youth growing in a highly competitive society. Your love for your parents and teachers, particularly to your mother, has welled many Korean eyes." 

"We are keen to present your latest book to our students in their language," the author said. 

Kalam presented Lee a signed copy of "Guiding Souls".

== په اوبتل کې سفر ==

ډاکټر عبدالکلام د هندوستان په تاريخ کې لومړنی ولسمشر دی چې په اوبتل کې يې سفر کړی دی. په ١۴ د فبروري ۲۰۰۶ کال عبدالکلام د (آی ان اس سندهوراکشاک)(INS Sindurakshak) يو روسي جوړ شوی اوبتل ته د ويشاکاپتانام سمندري بېړۍ اډې نه وخاته. د هغه د سفر موده څه کم درې نيم ساعته وه. چې په دغه مهال کې د هندوستان ولسمشر د بېړۍ املې سره غرمنۍ هم يوځای وخوړله.

== Dr Kalam’s silent work to make healthcare affordable ==
 

Unlike many scientists who do not look beyond their research, presidential nominee and father of India’s indigenous missile programme APJ Abdul Kalam has a rare passion to use it to make available state-of-the-art healthcare to the common man at affordable prices. 

For the past several years, the humanist in Dr Kalam has been silently working towards achieving his goal of taking quality healthcare to the rural areas by establishing a link between doctors and technocrats so that the spin-offs of defence technology benefit the common man. 

Mr Arun Tiwari, former DRDO missile scientist and co-author of Dr Kalam’s autobiography "wings of fire" told UNI that a fire at thumba during Dr Kalam’s stint with the ISRO in the early 80s set him thinking about the irony of india possessing the most sophisticated, hi-tech space and defence technologies while lagging behind in providing basic medical needs. 

One of Dr Kalam’s colleagues working in hi-tech payload preparation laboratory suffered severe burns following a violent explosion and was rushed to a hospital at Trivandrum. However, the hospital did not have a separate burns ward or facilities to treat patients suffering burns. 

Similarly, during his tenure as DRDO chief, Dr Kalam saw from close quarters how expensive imported medicines saved some of his colleagues who suffered life-threatening ailments. Not only that, he went out of his way and flew one of the scientists to london for a liver transplant. 

When another scientist suffered a heart attack and had to be administered an imported drug within 24 hours, Dr Kalam spoke to the then military attache, Brigadier Karai, in the Indian Embassy at london and networked through Air India and Indian Airlines and ensured that the drug reached the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) here within the stipulated time. 

Recently, Dr Kalam described a group of sceptic neurosurgeons at a city hospital here as "doubting thomases" after they did not warm up to his idea of looking at the feasibility of designing a bio-chip for mentally challenged children. However, an optimistic Kalam reminded them that technology "progresses by chasing the impossible." "He wants to do something concrete for mentally challenged children," Mr Tiwari added. The genial missile technologist’s burning desire to make available affordable healthcare by utilising defence technology spin-offs saw him establish the Society for Biomedical Technology (SBMT) in 1993 by bringing together defence scientists and medical experts to produce state-of-the-art indigenous medical equipment, devices and high-cost consumables which were being imported at steep rates. 

The SBMT was entrusted to make an external cardiac pacemaker, a cytoscan for early detection of cervical cancer (in view of its high incidence among rural indian women), stress test system, an ophthalmic laser, a coronary stent, floor reaction orthosis and other prosthetic devices for disabled children and a haemodialysis machine. 

However, only three projects — an indigenously developed coronary stent christened ‘Kalam-Raju Stent’, an ophthalmic laser and calipers — saw the light of the day. The other projects did not take off due to official apathy and lack of coordination among the diverse agencies involved in executing them. 

Dr Kalam also played a leading role in the recent launch of telemedicine projects connecting remote rural-based hospitals to the care super-speciality hospital here, so that the expertise of top doctors was made available to the rural people. 

The care foundation headed by eminent cardiologist B Soma Raju, who is closely associated with Dr Kalam, has linked Mahbubnagar District Hospital (in Andhra Pradesh) and another hospital in Puri (Orissa) to the super-speciality hospital. Another hospital in Assam is in the process of being linked. Mr Tiwari, now Director, Care Foundation, said: "Dr Kalam asked us to go to those remote areas which are contributing significantly to the GDP such as oilfields and coal mines but do not have adequate medical facilities". 

At the instance of Dr Kalam, defence and civil laboratories are in the process of developing an indigenous cathlab. "Seven technologies have been distributed among the laboratories to integrate the system, which would cost around Rs 50 lakh as against Rs two crore for an imported one," Mr Tiwari added. 

A cathlab is essential to carry out life-saving cardiac intervention procedures. At present, they are restricted to major cities - there are 250 cathlabs in 11 cities in the country. 

"People have to travel great distances even to get an angiogram done," he said, adding that the indigenous cathlab would be ready for clinical trials in about three months. (UNI)
