{{wiktionarypar|Argentina}}

The '''Argentine Republic''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República Argentina'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[reˈpuβlika aɾxɛnˈtina]}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]], situated between the [[Andes]] peaks in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[يوراګوای]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[British overseas territory|British overseas territories]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. Under the name of [[Argentine Antarctica]], it claims around 1,000,000 [[square kilometre]]s (386,000&nbsp;[[square miles|sq.&nbsp;mi]]) of [[Antarctica]], overlapping other claims by [[چېلي]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. By area, it is the second largest country of South America after Brazil and the 8th largest country in the [[world]].

The country is formally named ''República Argentina'' {{audio|1=es-Argentina.ogg|2=(pronunciation)}} (Argentine Republic), while for purposes of [[Law of Argentina|legislation]] the form ''Nación Argentina'' (Argentine Nation) is used.

==آرپوهه==
{{main|Origin and history of the name of Argentina}}

The name '''Argentina''' derives from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]). The first [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s called the River Plate the [[Río de la Plata]] ("River of Silver"). Indigenous people gave silver gifts to the survivors of the shipwrecked expedition, who were led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]]. The legend of [[Sierra del Plata]] &mdash; a mountain rich in silver &mdash; reached Spain around [[1524]]. The name Argentina was first used in Ruy Díaz de Guzmán's 1612 book ''Historia del descubrimiento, población, y conquista del Río de la Plata'' (History of the discovery, population, and conquest of the Río de la Plata), naming the territory ''Tierra Argentina'' (Land of Silver).

==تاريخ==
{{main|History of Argentina}}

The area of present Argentina was sparsely populated until it was colonised by [[european|Europeans]]. The native people known as [[Diaguita]] lived in northwestern Argentina on the edge of the expanding [[Inca Empire]]; the [[Guaraní]] lived farther east.

Europeans arrived in [[1502]]. [[Spain]] established a permanent colony on the site of [[Buenos Aires]] in [[1580]], and the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in [[1776]]. Independence from Spain was declared on [[July 9]] [[1816]]. Centralist and federationist groups were in conflict, until national unity was established and the [[Argentine constitution|constitution]] promulgated in [[1853]].

Foreign [[investment]] and [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]] from Europe aided the introduction of modern agricultural techniques and integration of Argentina into the world economy in the late 19th century. In the 1880s the "[[Conquest of the Desert]]" subdued or exterminated the remaining native tribes throughout [[Patagonia]].

From [[1880]] to [[1930]] Argentina became one of the ten wealthiest nations. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until [[1916]], when their traditional rivals, the [[Radical Civic Union|Radicals]], won control of the government. The military forced [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] from power in 1930 leading to another decade of Conservative rule.

Political change led to the presidency of [[Juan Perón]] in [[1946]], who aimed at empowering the working class and greatly expanded the number of unionised workers. The [[Revolución Libertadora]] of [[1955]] deposed him.

In the 1950s and 1960s, military and civilian administrations traded power. When military governments failed to revive the economy and suppress escalating [[terrorism]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the way was open for Perón's return to the presidency in 1973, with his third wife, [[Isabel Perón|María Estela Isabel Martínez de Perón]], as Vice President. During this period, extremists on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]] carried out [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts with a frequency that threatened public order.

[[Image:Buenos Aires-2672f-Banco de la Nación Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank of the Argentine Nation, Buenos Aires]]

Perón died in [[1974]]. His wife succeeded him in office, but a military coup removed her from office in [[1976]], and the armed forces formally exercised power through a [[junta]] in charge of the self-appointed [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|National Reorganisation Process]], until [[1983]]. The armed forces repressed opposition using harsh illegal measures (the "[[Dirty War]]"); thousands of dissidents were "[[desaparecidos|disappeared]]", while the [[SIDE]] cooperated with the [[CIA]], [[DINA]] and other South American intelligence agencies in [[Operation Condor]]. Many of the military leaders that took part in the Dirty War were trained in the U.S. financed [[School of the Americas]]. Among them Argentine dictators [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] and [[Roberto Viola]].

Economic problems, charges of corruption, public revulsion in the face of [[human rights]] abuses and, finally, the country's [[1982]] defeat in the [[Falklands War]] discredited the Argentine military regime. 

Democracy was restored in [[1983]]. [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s Radical government took steps intending to account for the "disappeared", establishing civilian control of the armed forces and consolidating democratic institutions. Failure to resolve endemic economic problems and an inability to maintain public confidence caused his early departure.

President [[Carlos Menem]] imposed [[Argentine peso|peso]]-[[US dollar|dollar]] [[fixed exchange rate]] in [[1991]] to stop [[hyperinflation]], and adopted far-reaching market-based policies, dismantling [[protectionism|protectionist]] barriers and business [[deregulation|regulations]], and implementing a privatisation program. These reforms contributed to significant increases in investment and growth with stable prices through most of the 1990s.

The Menem and [[Fernando de la Rúa|de la Rúa]] administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports, massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment, chronic fiscal and trade deficits, and the contagion of several economic crises. The [[Asian financial crisis]] in [[1998]] precipitated an outflow of capital that mushroomed into a [[recession]], which led to a total freezing of the [[bank account]]s (the ''[[corralito]]''), and culminated in a financial panic in November 2001. The next month, amidst [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|bloody riots]], President de la Rúa resigned.

Several new presidents followed in quick succession. Argentina [[default (finance)|default]]ed on its international debt obligations. The peso's almost 12-year-old link with the dollar was abandoned, resulting in massive [[devaluation|currency depreciation]] and [[inflation]], in turn triggering a spike in unemployment and poverty. In [[2003]], [[Néstor Kirchner]] became the president, and started implementing new policies based on re-industrialisation, [[import substitution]], increased exports, consistent fiscal surplus, and high exchange rate.

==سياست==

{{main|Politics of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Law of Argentina}}

The [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine constitution]] of 1853, as [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|revised in 1994]], mandates a [[Separation of powers|separation of powers]] into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial branch]]es at the national and provincial level. The [[president of Argentina|president]] and vice-president are directly elected to 4-year terms. Both are limited to two consecutive terms; they are allowed to stand for a third term or more after an interval of at least one term. The president appoints [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] ministers, and the constitution grants him considerable power as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], including authority to enact laws by presidential decree under conditions of "urgency and necessity" and the [[line-item veto]].

Argentina's [[parliament]] is the bicameral [[National Congress]] or ''[[Argentine National Congress|Congreso de la Nación]]'', consisting of a [[Senate]] (''[[Argentine Senate|Senado]]'') of 72 seats and a [[Chamber of Deputies]] (''[[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Cámara de Diputados]]'') of 257 members. Since 2001, senators have been directly elected, with each province, including the [[Federal Capital]], represented by three senators. Senators serve 6-year terms. One-third of the Senate stands for reelection every 2 years via a partial majority system in each district. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are directly elected to 4-year term via a system of [[proportional representation]]. Voters elect half the members of the [[lower house]] every 2 years.

<sup>*</sup> The current official name for the [[federal district]] is "Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires".

Buenos Aires has been the capital of Argentina since its unification, but there have been projects to move the administrative centre elsewhere. During the presidency of Raúl Alfonsín a law was passed ordering the move of the federal capital to [[Viedma]], a city in the Patagonic province of Río Negro. Studies were underway when hyperinflation, in 1989, killed off the project. Though the law was never formally repealed, it has become a mere historical relic, and the project has been forgotten.

===Urbanization===
{{main|List of cities in Argentina}}
[[Image:Tucuman_govthouse.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Government house of Tucumán]]
About 2.7 million people live in the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]], and roughly 11.5 million in [[Gran Buenos Aires|Greater Buenos Aires]] (2001), making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world. Together with their respective [[metropolitan area]]s, the second and third largest cities in Argentina, [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Rosario]], comprise about 1.3 and 1.1 million inhabitants, respectively.

Most European [[immigration in Argentina|immigrants to Argentina]] (coming in great waves especially around the World War I and II) settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the [[middle class]]. Since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.

The 1990s saw many rural towns become [[ghost town]]s when train services were abandoned and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of imported cheap goods, in part because of the monetary policy which kept the U.S. dollar exchange rate fixed and low. Many slums (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities, inhabited by empoverished low-class urban dwellers and migrants from smaller towns in the interior of the country. However, it is important to note that the majority of the people that live in these newly formed small shanty towns are people that came from neighboring countries during the time of convertibility and never left. This immigration of humble people from a low socioeconomic status represented an undesirable change because shanty towns and homeless people begging for money was something Argentines didn't know until the economic disaster of the 1990s. However, the government works actively to try to include these new inmigrants into Argentine society and considers their children born in Argentina to be Argentines. There are no plans to build any type of wall to keep these inmigrants out. Argentina adheres to a policy of allowing anybody who wants to come to Argentina to come freely without restrictive inmigration measures. In this respect Argentina is more progressive than many fully developed countries. 

<!-- to be filled in with middle class home data -->
Argentina's urban areas have a European look, reflecting the influence of their European settlers. Many towns and cities are built like Spanish cities around a main square called a plaza. A cathedral and important government buildings often face the plaza. The general layout of the cities is called a ''damero'', that is, a checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks, though modern developments sometimes depart from it (for example, the city of La Plata, built at the end of the 19th century, is organised as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals).

In descending order by number of inhabitants, the major cities in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumán]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bahía Blanca]].

==جغرافيه==
[[Image:Ar-map.png|200px|thumb|Map of Argentina]]
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}

Argentina can roughly be divided into three parts: the fertile plains of the [[Pampa]]s in the central part of the country, the centre of Argentina's [[agriculture|agricultural]] wealth; the flat to rolling plateau of [[Patagonia]] in the southern half down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the rugged [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point being the [[Cerro Aconcagua]] at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

Major rivers include the [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. The latter two flow together before meeting the [[Atlantic Ocean]], forming the estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]]. The Argentine [[climate]] is predominantly [[temperate climate|temperate]] with extremes ranging from [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] in the north to arid/sub-Antarctic in far south.

=== Enclaves and exclaves ===
There is one Argentine [[exclave]]: the island of [[Martín García]] (co-ordinates {{coor dm|34|11|S|58|15|W}}). It is situated near the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, a mere kilometre (0.62&nbsp;mi) inside [[Uruguay]]an waters, about 3.5 kilometres (2.1 mi) from the Uruguayan coastline, near the small city of [[Martín Chico]] (itself about halfway between [[Nueva Palmira]] and [[Colonia del Sacramento]]).

An agreement reached by Argentina and Uruguay in 1973 reaffirmed Argentine jurisdiction over the island, ending a century-old dispute between the two countries. According to the terms of the agreement, Martín García is to be devoted exclusively to a natural preserve. Its area is about 2 square kilometres (500&nbsp;[[acre]]s), and the population about 200 people.

==اقتصاد==
[[Image:Buenos Aires Monserrat.jpg|thumb|250px|Subway station in Monserrat, Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Economy of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Tourism in Argentina}}
Argentina benefits from rich [[natural resource]]s, a highly [[literate]] population, an export-oriented [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, and a diversified [[industry|industrial]] base. The country historically had a large middle class, compared to other Latin American countries, but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises. Today, while a significant segment of the population is still financially well-off, they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it.

Since the late 1970s the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high [[inflation]]. In 1991, the government [[fixed exchange rate|pegged]] the peso to the [[United States dollar|U. S. dollar]] and limited the growth in the [[monetary base]]. The government then embarked on a path of [[free trade|trade liberalisation]], [[deregulation]], and [[privatisation]]. Inflation dropped and [[gross domestic product|GDP]] grew, but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits, causing it to crumble in slow motion, from 1995 and up to the [[Argentine economic crisis|collapse in 2001]].

By 2002 Argentina had [[default (finance)|default]]ed on its debt, its GDP had shrunk, [[unemployment]] was over 25%, the peso had [[devaluation|devalued]] 75% after being [[floating exchange rate|floated]], and inflation was hitting again. However, careful spending control and heavy [[tax]]es on now soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct [[monetary policy]].

In 2003, [[import substitution]] policies and soaring [[export]]s, coupled with a lower inflation and expansive economic measures, triggered a surge in the GDP, which was repeated in 2004, creating jobs and encouraging internal consumption. [[Capital flight]] decreased, and [[foreign investment]] slowly returned. The influx of foreign currency from exports created such a huge [[trade surplus]] that the Central Bank was forced to buy dollars from the market, which it continues to do at the time, to be accumulated as [[reserve currency|reserves]].

The situation in 2005 is much improved, but there are still large numbers of unemployed people that beg for some money or food, especially in the outskirts of [[Buenos Aires]]. Some of them are homeless, and there is at least one small non-profit humanitarian organisation which distributes free food to some of them most days of the week. However, the country is still the most developed country in Latin America. It boasts the highest GDP per capita, the highest levels of education measured by university attendance, and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects is equal in quality to that found in fully industrialized nations. In 2002 over 57% of the population was below the poverty line, at the end of 2005 it was 34%. In 2002 unemployement had reached over 25%, and now it is 10%. GDP per capita has surpassed the previous pre-recession peek of 1998. It is a very interesting time in Argentina because the experts agree that if the country makes the right decisions it could develop and reclaim its previosly held position in the first world. So far things are looking good; the economy grew 8.8% in 2003, 9.0% in 2004, and 9.1% in 2005. The floor is set so that the economy will grow between 6.0% and 7.5% in 2006 and the government is paying down the foreign debt; foreign debt now stands at 69% of GDP and is slowly decreasing. The Argentine economy has so much untapped potential that if the country manages to encourage the proper level of investment the country could experience growth rates of 9.0% for this year and years to come.

==Demographics==
[[Image:TeatroColon.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Night shot of the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
{{main|Demographics of Argentina}}

Unlike most of its neighbouring countries, Argentina's population descends overwhelmingly from [[Europe|Europeans]]. The basic demographic stock (97% of the population) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ar.html] is made up of descendants of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other [[Europe|European]] settlers. 

Waves of immigrants from [[Europe]]an countries arrived in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]]. The Patagonian [[Chubut Valley]] has a significant [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh-descended population]] and retains many aspects of [[Wales|Welsh]] culture. Other important immigrant groups came from [[Germany]] ([[Germany|German]] colonies were settled in the provinces of Entre Ríos, Misiones, Formosa, Córdoba and the Patagonian region, as well as in Buenos Aires itself), [[France]] (mostly settled in Buenos Aires city and province), [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]), the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] (Buenos Aires and Patagonia), and [[Eastern Europe]]an nations, such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[Balkans]] region (especially [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]) and others. The overwhelming majority of Argentina's [[Jew|Jewish]] community, numbering about 395,379  [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html], also derives from immigrants of Northern and Eastern European origin &mdash; [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. It is the largest Jewish community in [[Latin America]] and fifth largest in the world.

[[Middle East]]ern immigrants number about 500,000, mainly in urban areas.{{Citation needed}}

Small numbers of people from [[Far East]] [[Asia]] have also settled Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires. The first [[Asian-Argentines]] were of [[Japan]]ese descent, but [[Korea]]ns, [[Vietnam]]ese, and [[China|Chinese]] soon followed. There are also smaller numbers of people from the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==کلتور/فرهڼ==
[[Image:Buenos_Aires-Center-P3050007.JPG|thumb|European and modern styles in Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Culture of Argentina}}
{{seealso|List of Argentines}}
Argentine culture has been primarily informed and influenced by its European roots. [[Buenos Aires]] is undeniably the most European city in [[South America]], due both to the prevalence of people of Italian, Spanish and German descent and to conscious imitation.

Argentine cinema has achieved international recognition with films such as "[[The Official Story]]" and "[[Nine Queens]]", though it has only rarely been taken into account by mainstream popular viewers who prefer [[Hollywood]]-type movies. Even low-budget productions, however, have obtained prizes in cinema festivals (such as [[Cannes]]). The city of [[Mar del Plata]] organizes its own festival dedicated to this art.

The best-known element of Argentine culture is probably their music and dance, particularly [[tango (dance)|tango]]. In modern Argentina, tango music is enjoyed in its own right, especially since the radical [[Astor Piazzolla]] redefined the music of [[Carlos Gardel]]. It must be noted that while tango refers mostly to a particular dancing music for foreigners, the music together with the lyrics (often sung in a kind of slang called [[lunfardo]]) are what most Argentines primarily mean by tango. Tango lyrics can be considered a kind of poetry. 
Since the 1970s rock and roll is also widely appreciated in Argentina. First during the 1970s and then again at the mid 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, national rock and roll and pop music experienced bursts of popularity, with many new bands (such as [[Soda Stereo]] and Sumo) and composers (like [[Charly García]] and [[Fito Páez]]) becoming important referents of national culture.
[[Buenos Aires]] is also considered the [[techno]]/[[electronica]] country in Latin America, that started with little raves, and nowadays is home of important events such as [[Creamfields]] (which has the world record of 65,000 people), South American Music Conference and many more.

[[European classical music]] is well-considered in Argentina, with the [[Colón Theater]] one of the best opera houses in the world. Musicians such as [[Martha Argerich]] and composers like [[Lalo Schifrin]] have become internationally famous.

Argentina has a wide variety of typical foods ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Comidas típicas''), which include: ''Empanadas'', a stuffed between two lids of dough; ''[[Locro]]'', a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd; and ''Chorizos'', a meat-based spicy sausage. The Argentine barbecue ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Asado argentino'') is one of the most famous in the world including various types of meats, among them the ''chorizo'', ''mollejas'', ''chinchulín'', and the ''morcilla.''

The only official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although some immigrants and indigenous communities have retained their [[List of Native American languages in Argentina|original languages]] in specific points of the country. There are, for example many [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking towns in Patagonia and [[German language|German]]-speaking cities in Córdoba, Buenos Aires and Patagonia. Italian and French is also widely spoken.

Argentina is the largest [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking community in the world that employs ''[[voseo]]'' (the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'', associated with some alternate verb conjugations). The most prevalent dialect is [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]], with most speakers located in the basin of the [[Río de la Plata]].

===مذهب===
{{main|Religion in Argentina}}
Argentina is an overwhelmingly [[Christian]] country. The majority of Argentina's population (80%) is at least nominally [[Roman Catholic]]. Roman Catholicism is supported by the state, as stipulated in the Constitution. Evangelical churches gained a place in Argentina especially since the 1980s and now number more than 3.5 million or 10%. Members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]) number over 330,300, the seventh largest concentration in the world[http://www.lds.org.ar/noticias2005/noti_ene2005/info_noti_ene2005_05.htm]. Traditional [[Protestant]] communities are also present.

The country also hosts the largest [[Judaism|Jewish]] population in [[Latin America]], about 395,379 strong. It is also home to one of the largest [[mosque]]s in Latin America, serving Argentina's small [[Islam|Muslim]] community.
