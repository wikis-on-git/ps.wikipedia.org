'''Namibia''', officially the '''Republic of Namibia''', is a country in [[southern Africa]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. It is bordered by [[آنګولا]], and [[Zambia]] to the north, [[Zimbabwe]] to the north-east, [[بوټسوانا]] to the east, and [[سوېلي افريقا]] to the south. It gained independence from South Africa in [[1990]] and its capital is [[Windhoek]].
Namibia is a member state of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== تاريخ ==
[[دوتنه:Herero.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Herero]], circa 1910.]]
{{main|History of Namibia}}

The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by [[Bushmen]], [[Damara (people)|Damara]], [[Namaqua]], and since about the fourteenth century AD, by immigrating [[Bantu]] who came with the [[Bantu expansion]]. The region was not extensively explored by [[Europe]]ans until the [[19th century]], when the land came under [[German Empire|German]] control as [[South-West Africa]] -- apart from [[Walvis Bay]] under [[United Kingdom|British]] control. [[South Africa]] occupied the colony during [[World War I]] and administered it as a [[League of Nations]] [[mandate territory]] until after [[World War II]], when it unilaterally annexed the territory, albeit without international recognition.

In [[1966]] the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[South-West Africa People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] group launched a war of independence, but it was not until [[1988]] that South Africa agreed to end its administration of Namibia, in accordance with a [[United Nations]] peace plan for the entire region. Independence came in [[1990]], and Walvis Bay was ceded to Namibia in [[1994]].

{{morepolitics|country=Namibia}}
The Namibian [[head of state]] is the [[president]], elected by popular vote every five years. The government is headed by the [[prime minister]], who, together with his [[cabinet]], is appointed by the president. SWAPO, the primary force behind independence is still currently the country's largest party. 

Namibia's [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of Namibia|parliament]] consists of the [[National Council of Namibia|National Council]] with twenty six seats, occupied by two members chosen from each regional council to serve six-year terms; and the [[National Assembly of Namibia|National Assembly]] of seventy eight seats, of which seventy two members are elected by popular vote, and six non-voting members are appointed by the president. All seventy eight serve five-year terms.

The Assembly is the primary [[legislative]] body, with the Council playing more of an advisory role. The [[1990]] [[constitution]] is noted for being one of the first to incorporate protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]] into its text. The highest [[judiciary|judicial]] body is the Supreme Court, whose judges are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission.

== جغرافيه ==
:''Main articles: [[Geography of Namibia]]'', [[Towns in Namibia]]
[[دوتنه:wa-map.gif|framed|right|thumb|Map of Namibia]]

The Namibian landscape consists primarily of central highlands, of which the highest point is the [[Brandberg Massif|Brandberg]] at 2,606 metres (8,550&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).  The central plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the [[Namib Desert]] and its coastal plains to the west, the [[Orange River]] to the south, and the [[Kalahari Desert]] to the east.  

A remarkable strip of land in the northeast, known as the [[Caprivi Strip]] is the vestige of a narrow corridor demarcated for the [[German Empire]] to access the [[Zambezi River]]. 
The Namibian [[climate]] ranges from [[desert climate|desert]] to subtropical, and is generally hot and dry; [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is sparse and erratic.  The cold, north-flowing [[Benguela current]] accounts for some of the low precipitation.  Besides the capital city [[Windhoek]] in the centre of the country, other important towns are the ports of [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Swakopmund]], as well as [[Oshakati]], [[Grootfontein]], [[Tsumeb]] and [[Keetmanshoop]].

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|Economy of Namibia}}

The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction and processing of [[mineral]]s for export. [[Mining]] accounts for 20% of the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in [[Africa]], and the world's fifth largest producer of [[uranium]]. Rich alluvial [[diamond]] deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[silver]], and [[tungsten]].

About half of the population depends on [[agriculture]] (largely [[subsistence agriculture]]) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of large-scale [[unemployment]], the great inequality of income distribution, and the large amount of wealth going to foreigners. The Namibian economy has many close links to [[South Africa]]. Agreement has been reached on the [[privatisation]] of several more enterprises in coming years, which should stimulate long-run foreign investment.

[[Child labour]] occurs in Namibia, and the country is in the process or formulating an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which is expected to be adopted in the period 2006-2007. For more information, see [[Child labour in Namibia|this article]].

=== Namibia and tourism ===
Namibia generally attracts [[ecotourism|eco-tourists]] with the majority visiting to experience the different climates and natural geographical landscapes such as the great eastern desert and plains. There are many lodges and reserves for eco-tourists to travel to and stay over.  In 2006, Namibia gained international notoriety as a tourist destination when [[US]] celebrities [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Angelina Jolie]] chose the country as a sanctuary from the media for the birth of their daughter [[Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt]].

{{main|Demographics of Namibia}}

Namibia is among the three sovereign countries with the lowest population density. The majority of the Namibian population consists of a mostly black African ([[Bantu]] and [[Khoisan]]) (84%) - mostly of the [[Ovambo]] tribe, which forms about half of the population, concentrated in the north of the country. In addition to the [[black people|black]] [[Bantu]] majority, there are large groups of [[Khoisan]] (e.g. [[Nama language|Nama]] and [[Bushmen]]), who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa. Khoisan differ significantly in appearance from both [[Bantu]] and [[white people|whites]]. Blacks of other Bantu descent are descendants of people as refugees from [[Angola]]. There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins, called "[[Coloureds]]" and "[[Basters]]", who together make up 8% (with the [[Coloureds]] outnumbering the [[Basters]] two to one). Whites of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German People|German]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[French people|French]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry make up about 8% of the population—which is the second largest proportion in sub-Saharan Africa, after [[South Africa]]). Most of Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race are [[Afrikaans]] speakers and share similar origins, culture, religion and genealogy as the white and coloured populations of neighbouring South Africa. A smaller proportion of whites (around 20,000) trace their family origins directly back to German settlers and maintain German cultural and educational institutions. All Portuguese are white miners and settlers from their former colony of Angola.

Half of all Namibians speak [[Ovambo|Oshiwambo]] (Ovambo) as their first language, whereas the most widely understood language is [[Afrikaans]]. Among the younger generation, the most widely understood language is [[English language|English]]. Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public sphere communication, but small first language groups exist throughout the country. While the official language is [[English language|English]], most of the white population speaks either [[Afrikaans]] or [[German language|German]], both official languages until [[1990]] when Namibia became independent.  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken by blacks and whites from Angola. [[Christianity]] is the major religion, with the [[Lutheran Church]] being the largest.

{{Main|Foreign relations of Namibia}}

Namibia follows a largely independent [[foreign policy]], with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including [[Libya]] and [[Cuba]].

With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the [[Southern Africa]]n region. A dynamic member of the [[Southern African Development Community]], Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration.

Namibia became the 160th member of the [[United Nations]] on [[April 23]], 1990, and the 50th member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] upon independence. 

=== نړېوالې لانجې ===

Namibia are involved in several minor international disputes, including:
* commission established with [[Botswana]] to resolve small residual disputes along the [[Caprivi Strip]], including the [[Situngu marshlands]] along the [[Linyanti River]]
* [[Botswana]] residents protest Namibia's planned construction of the [[Okavango]] hydroelectric dam on [[Popa Falls]]
* managed dispute with [[South Africa]] over the location of the boundary in the [[Orange River]]
* dormant dispute remains where [[Botswana]], [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]] boundaries converge
* [[Angola]]n rebels and refugees still reside in Namibia.

== پوځ ==

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defined the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests." Namibia formed the [[National Defence Force]] (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the [[Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) and [[South West Africa]]n ''Territorial Force'' ([[SWATF]]). The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. The [[United Nations Transitional Assistance Group]] (UNTAG)'s [[Kenya]]n infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to assist in training the NDF and stabilize the north. According to the [[Namibian Defence Ministry]], enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7,500. Defence and security account for less than 8% of government spending.
