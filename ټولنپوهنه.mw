{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology''' (from Latin: ''socius'', "companion"; and Greek: λόγος, ''logos'', "knowledge") is an academic and applied discipline that studies [[society]] and human social interaction. Sociological [[research]] ranges from the analysis of short [[social contact|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. The field focuses on how and why people are organized in society, either as [[individual]]s or as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], and [[social institution|institutions]]. As an [[academic discipline]], sociology is typically considered a [[social science]]. 

One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-disciplines (sometimes called fields) that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and [[class structure]]; [[demography]] studies changes in a [[population size]] or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behavior and deviance; [[political sociology]] studies government and laws; and the [[race relations|sociology of race]] and [[sociology of gender]] examine the [[social construction]] of race and gender as well as race and [[Gender gap|gender inequality]].  New sociological fields and sub-fields&mdash;such as [[network analysis]] and [[environmental sociology]]&mdash;continue to evolve; many of them are cross-disciplinary in nature. 

[[Social research | Sociological research]] provides [[educators]], [[urban planner|planner]]s, [[lawmaker]]s, [[Public administration|administrator]]s, [[Real-estate developer|developer]]s, [[Business magnate | business leader]]s, and people interested in resolving [[Social issues | social problem]]s and formulating [[public policy]] with [[Rationalization (sociology) | rationales]] for the actions that they take.

{{main|History of sociology}}
[[Image:People3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Social interaction]]s and their consequences are the subject of sociology. (Image: [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]].)]]
Sociology, in studying society, including economic, political and cultural systems, has origins in the [[common stock]] of human [[knowledge]] and [[philosophy]]. [[Social analysis]] has been carried out by scholars and [[philosophy|philosophers]] at least as early as the time of [[Plato]]. In the [[14th century]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is sometimes considered the "[[List of people known as father or mother of something|father of sociology]]",<ref>H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.</ref><ref>Dr. S. W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought & Culture'' '''12''' (3).</ref> in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', the introduction to a seven volume analysis of [[universal history]], advanced [[social philosophy]] in formulating theories of [[social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]]. (See [[Early Muslim sociology]].)

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:auguste_Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Auguste Comte]]]] -->
Sociology emerged as a scientific discipline in the early [[19th century]] as an academic response to the challenges of [[modernity]] and [[modernization]], such as [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. Sociologists hoped not only to understand what held social groups together, but also to develop responses to [[social disintegration]] and [[exploitation]].  

The word sociology was coined by French thinker [[Auguste Comte]] in 1838 from [[Latin]] ''socius'' (companion, associate) and [[greek language|Greek]] λóγος, ''lógos'' (word). Comte hoped to unify all studies of humankind - including history, psychology and economics. His own sociological scheme was typical of the 19th century; he believed all human life had passed through the same distinct historical stages (theology, metaphysics, [[positive science]]) and that, if one could grasp this progress, one could prescribe the remedies for social ills. Sociology was to be the 'queen of positive sciences.'

[[Image:Karl_Marx.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Karl Marx]]]]
"Classical" theorists of sociology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Karl Marx, [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Max Weber]]. Like Comte, these figures did not consider themselves only "sociologists". Their works addressed [[religion]], [[education]], [[economics]], [[law]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]], and their theories have been applied in a variety of academic disciplines. Their influence on sociology was foundational.

===Institutionalizing Sociology===

The discipline was taught by its own name for the first time at the [[University of Kansas]], [[Lawrence]] in 1890 by Frank Blackmar, under the course title ''Elements of Sociology'' (the oldest continuing sociology course in America). The ''Department of History and Sociology'' at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 [http://www.ku.edu/%7Esocdept/about/],[http://www.news.ku.edu/2005/June/June15/sociology.shtml], and the first full fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Albion W. Small]], who in 1895 founded the [[American Journal of Sociology]] [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJS/home.html]. 

[[Image:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Weber]]]]
The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the [[University of Bordeaux]] by [[Émile Durkheim]], founder of ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]'' (1896). The first sociology department to be established in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] was at the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]] (home of the British Journal of Sociology) [http://www.lse.ac.uk/serials/Bjs/] in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] by [[Max Weber]] and in 1920 in [[Poland]] by [[Florian Znaniecki]].

International cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when [[René Worms]] founded the small ''[[Institut International de Sociologie]]'' that was later on eclipsed by the much larger [[International Sociological Association]] [http://www.isa-sociology.org/] starting in 1949 (ISA). 1905, the [[American Sociological Association]], the world's largest [[Voluntary association|association]] of professional sociologists, was founded; in 1909 as well the ''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie'' ([[German Society for Sociology]]) by [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Max Weber]] et al.

===Positivism and anti-positivism===
:''Articles: [[Positivism]], [[Sociological positivism]], and [[Antipositivism]].''

Early theorists' approach to sociology, led by [[Comte]], was to treat it in much the same manner as [[natural science]], applying the same methods and [[methodology]] used in the natural sciences to study [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]]. The emphasis on [[empiricism]] and the [[scientific method]] sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields such as [[philosophy]]. This methodological approach, called [[Sociological positivism|positivism]] aspires to [[explanation]] and [[prediction]].  A non-trivial share of sociologists reject these goals. 

One push away from positivism was philosophical and political, such as in the [[dialectical materialism]] based on [[Marx]]'s theories. A second push away from scientific positivism was cultural, even sociological. As early as the 19th century, [[positivist]] and [[Natural science|naturalist]] approaches to studying [[Social relation|social life]] were questioned by scientists like [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]], who argued that the natural world differs from the [[Social reality|social world]] because of unique aspects of human society such as [[meaning]]s, [[symbol]]s, [[rule]]s, [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. These elements of society inform human [[culture]]s. This view was further developed by [[Max Weber]], who introduced [[antipositivism]] ([[humanistic sociology]]). According to this view, which is closely related to [[antinaturalism]], sociological research must concentrate on humans' cultural values (see also: [[French pragmatism]]).
<!-- need some wording about subjectivity, postmodernism, and feminist epistemological answers to positivism -->

===Twentieth century developments===
In the early 20th century, sociology expanded in United States, including developments in both [[macrosociology]] interested in [[evolution of societies]] and [[microsociology]]. Based on the [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] social psychology of [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Herbert Blumer]] and other later [[Chicago school]] inspired sociologists developed [[symbolic interactionism]].

In Europe, in the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]], sociology generally was attacked both by increasingly totalitarian governments and rejected by conservative universities. At the same time, originally in Austria and later in the U.S., [[Alfred Schütz]] developed social [[phenomenology]] (which would later inform [[social constructionism]]). Also, members of [[Frankfurt School|the Frankfurt school]] (some of whom moved to the U.S. to escape Nazi persecution) developed [[critical theory (Frankfurt School)|critical theory]], integrating critical, idealistic and historical materialistic elements of the [[dialectics|dialectical]] philosophies of [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] with the insights of [[Freud]], [[Max Weber]] (in theory, if not always in name) and others. In the 1930s in the U.S., [[Talcott Parsons]] developed [[structural-functional theory]] which integrated the study of [[social order]] and "objective" aspects of macro and micro structural factors. 

Since [[World War II]], sociology has been revived in Europe, although during the [[Stalin]] and [[Mao]] eras it was suppressed in the [[communist]] countries. In the mid-20th century, there was a general (but not universal) trend for American sociology to be more  scientific in nature, due partly to the prominent influence at that time of [[Functionalism (sociology)|structural functionalism]]. Sociologists developed new types of [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative research]] methods. In the second half of the [[20th century]], sociological research has been increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses. Parallel with the rise of various [[social movements]] in the 1960s, theories emphasizing social struggle, including [[conflict theory]] (which sought to counter [[Functionalism (sociology)|structural functionalism]]) and [[neomarxist]] theories, began to receive more attention.

In the [[Late 20th Century|late 20th century]], some sociologists embraced [[postmodern]] and [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] philosophies. Increasingly, many sociologists have used [[qualitative]] and [[ethnographic]] methods and become critical of the positivism in some social scientific approaches. Much like [[cultural studies]], some contemporary sociological studies have been influenced by the cultural changes of the [[1960s]], 20th century [[Continental philosophy]], [[literature|literary]] studies, and [[interpretivism]]. Others have maintained more objective empirical perspectives, such as by articulating [[neofunctionalism]] and [[pure sociology]]. Others began to debate the nature of [[globalization]] and the changing nature of social institutions. These developments have led some to reconceptualize basic sociological categories and theories. For instance, inspired by the thought of [[Michel Foucault]], power may be studied as dispersed throughout society in a wide variety disciplinary cultural practices. In [[political sociology]], the power of the nation state may be seen as transforming due to the globalization of trade (and cultural exchanges) and the expanding influence of [[international organization]]s (Nash 2000:1-4).

However, the positivist tradition is still alive and influential in sociology, as evidenced by the rise of [[social networks]] as both a new paradigm that suggests paths to go beyond the traditional micro vs. macro or agency vs. structure debates and a new methodology. The influence of social network analysis is pervasive in many sociological subfields such as [[economic sociology]] (see the work of [[Harrison White]] or [[Mark Granovetter]] for example), [[organizational behavior]], or [[historical sociology]].

Throughout the development of sociology, controversies have raged about how to emphasize or integrate concerns with [[subjectivity]], [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], [[intersubjectivity]] and practicality in theory and research. The extent to which sociology may be characterized as a '[[science]]' has remained an area of considerable debate, which has addressed basic [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] [[philosophical]] questions. One outcome of such disputes has been the ongoing formation of multidimensional theories of society, such as the continuing development of various types of [[critical theory]]. Another outcome has been the formation of [[public sociology]], which emphasizes the usefulness of sociological analysis to various social groups.

==Scope and topics of Sociology==

:''Selected general topics: [[Discrimination]], [[Deviance]] and [[social control]], [[Migration]], [[Social action]], [[Social change]], [[Social class]], [[Social justice]]/[[injustice]], [[Social order]], [[Social status]], [[Social stratification]], [[Socialization]], [[Society]], [[Sociological imagination]], [[Structure and agency]], [[Subfields of sociology]]''

Sociologists study society and social action by examining the groups and [[social institution]]s people form, as well as various social, religious, political, and [[business organizations]]. They also study the [[social interaction]]s of people and groups, trace the origin and growth of social processes, and analyze the influence of group [[activity|activities]] on individual members and vice versa. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, and others interested in resolving [[social problems]], working for [[social justice]] and formulating public policy. 

Sociologists research macro-[[social structure|structure]]s and processes that organize or affect society, such as [[race]] or [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], [[globalization]], and [[social class]] stratification. They study institutions such as the [[family]] and social processes that represent [[deviation]] from, or the breakdown of, social structures, including [[crime]] and [[divorce]]. And, they research micro-processes such as interpersonal interactions and the [[socialization]] of individuals. Sociologists are also concerned with the effect of social traits such as sex, age, or race on a person’s daily life. 

Most sociologists work in one or more specialties, such as [[social stratification]], social organization, and [[social mobility]]; ethnic and [[race relations]]; [[education]]; [[Sociology of the family|family]]; [[social psychology]]; [[urban sociology|urban]], [[rural sociology|rural]], [[political sociology|political]], and [[comparative sociology]]; [[sex roles]] and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]; [[demography]]; [[gerontology]]; [[criminology]]; and [[sociological practice]]. In short, sociologists study the many faces of society. 

Although sociology was informed by Comte's conviction that sociology would sit at the apex of all the sciences, sociology today is identified as one of many [[social sciences]] (such as [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], etc.). At times, sociology does integrate the insights of various disciplines, as do other social sciences. Initially, the discipline was concerned particularly with the organization of complex [[industrial society|industrial societies]]. Recent sociologists, taking cues from anthropologists, have noted the "[[Western culture|Western]] emphasis" of the field. In response, sociology departments around the world are encouraging the study of many cultures and multi-national studies.

==Sociological theory==
:''Main articles: [[sociological theory]] and [[social theory]]''

''Sociological theory'' refers to the use of [[Abstraction (sociology)|abstract]] and often complex [[theoretical]] frameworks to explain and analyze [[social action]], social processes and [[social structure]]s. Sociological theory refers to theories developed by sociologists, though the term has been used synonymously with ''social theory'', as in Swingewood (2000) and Ritzer and Goodman (2004). ''[[Social theory]]'' is [[interdisciplinary]] as it generally includes ideas from multiple fields, such as [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[theology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and others. Many sociologists use both sociological theory and interdisciplinary social theory. The boundaries between these are sometimes fuzzy due to overlaps in origins and content. 

Social theories developed almost simultaneously with the birth of the sociology itself. In the 19th century three great, classical theories of social and historical change were created: [[social evolutionism]] (of which [[social Darwinism]] is a part), [[social cycle theory]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[historical materialism]]. Although the majority of 19th century social theories are now considered obsolete, they have spawned modern social theories, including [[Multilineal evolution|multilineal theories of evolution]] ([[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[theory of modernisation]], [[theory of post-industrial society]]) or the [[theory of subjectivity]]. 

In the 20th century, sociologists developed sociological theories which were based in the institutions and literature of professional sociology. Modern sociological theories include [[conflict theory]], [[structural functionalism]] (and more recently [[neofunctionalism]]), and [[symbolic interactionism]]. At the same time, sociologists have continued to use and contribute to interdisciplinary social theories. Some types of social theory commonly used in sociology include [[feminist theory]], [[neomarxism]], [[network theory]], [[postmodern]] theory, [[poststructuralist]] theory, [[rational choice]] theory, and [[systems theory]] (Ritzer and Goodman 2004:185-225). 

There is a tension in the discipline between more abstract theory and more [[empirical]] theory. Some social and sociological theories tackle very large-scale social trends and structures using [[hypotheses]] that cannot be easily falsified and require support by historical or philosophical interpretations. Social theories about [[modernity]] or [[globalization]] are two examples. Some theorists, such as [[deconstruction]]ists or [[postmodernists]], may argue that any systematic type of social scientific research theory is inherently flawed. 

In empirical social research, empirical findings can provide support for sociological theories and vice versa. For instance, statistical research grounded in the scientific method may find a severe [[income disparity]] between women and men performing the same occupation. This finding supports the complex social theories of [[feminism]] or [[patriarchy]]. A [[sociological perspective]] (see [[sociological imagination]]) has through the years appealed to students and others dissatisfied with the [[status quo]] because it carries the assumption that societal structures may be arbitrary or controlled by specific powerful groups, thus implying the possibility of change.

==Sociological research==
{{main|social research}}
The basic goal of sociological research is to understand the social world in its many forms.   [[Quantitative method]]s and [[qualitative method]]s are two main types of [[social research]] methods. Sociologists often use [[quantitative method]]s -- such as [[social statistics]] or [[network analysis]] - to investigate the structure of a social process or describe patterns in social relationships.  Sociologists also often use [[qualitative method]]s - such as focused [[interview]]s, group discussions and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] methods - to investigate social processes. Sociologists also use applied research methods such as [[evaluation research]] and [[assessment]]. 
===Methods of sociological inquiry===
Sociologists use many types of social research methods, including:
*Archival research - Facts or factual evidences from a variety of records are compiled. 
*Content Analysis - The contents of books and [[mass media]] are analyzed to study how people communicate and the messages people talk or write about. 
*Historical Method - This involves a continuous and systematic search for the information and knowledge about past events related to the life of a person, a group, society, or the world. 
*Interviews - The researcher obtains data by interviewing people. If the interview is non-structured, the researcher leaves it to the interviewee (also referred to as the respondent or the informant) to guide the conversation. 
*Life History - This is the study of the [[personal life]] trajectories. Through a series of interviews, the researcher can probe into the decisive moments in their life or the various influences on their life. 
*Longitudinal study - This is an extensive examination of a specific group over a long period of time.
*Observation - Using data from the senses, one records information about social phenomenon or behavior. Qualitative research relies heavily on observation, although it is in a highly disciplined form. 
*Participant Observation - As the name implies, the researcher goes to the field (usually a community), lives with the people for some time, and participates in their activities in order to know and feel their culture.

The choice of a method in part often depends on the researcher's epistemological approach to research. For example, those researchers who are concerned with statistical generalizability to a population will most likely administer structured interviews with a survey questionnaire to a carefully selected probability sample. By contrast, those sociologists, especially ethnographers, who are more interested in having a full contextual understanding of group members lives will choose [[participant observation]], observation, and [[open-ended]] interviews. Many studies combine several of these methodologies.

The relative merits of these research methodologies is a topic of much professional debate among practicing sociologists.

===Combining research methods=== 
In practice, some sociologists combine different research methods and approaches, since different methods produce different types of findings that correspond to different aspects of societies. For example, the quantitative methods may help describe social [[patterns]], while qualitative approaches could help to understand how individuals understand those patterns. 

An example of using multiple types of research methods is in the study of the [[Internet]]. The Internet is of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for [[social research|research]], for example, in using [[online]] [[questionnaire]]s instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. Sociology of the Internet in the last sense includes analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. as found in [[newsgroups]]), [[virtual communities]] and [[Virtual World|virtual worlds]], organisational change catalysed through [[new media]] like the Internet, and societal change [[Bloc voting|at-large]] in the transformation from [[industrial society|industrial]] to [[informational society]] (or to [[information society]]). Online communities can be studied statistically through [[network analysis]] and at the same time interpreted qualitatively, such as though [[virtual ethnography]]. Social change can be studied through statistical [[demographics]] or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols in online [[media studies]].

==Sociology and other social sciences==
Sociology shares deep ties with a wide array of other disciplines that also deal with the study of society. The fields of [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[anthropology]] have influenced and have been influenced by sociology and these fields share a great amount of history and common research interests.

Today sociology and the other sciences are better contrasted according to methodology rather than objects of study. Additionally, unlike sociology, psychology and anthropology have [[forensic]] components within these disciplines that deal with [[anatomy]] and other types of laboratory research. 

[[Sociobiology]] is the study of how [[social behavior]] and organization has been influenced by [[evolution]] and other [[biological process]]es. The field blends sociology with a number other sciences, such as [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], and others.  Although the field once rapidly gained acceptance, it has remained highly controversial within the sociological academy.<ref> Gross, Paul R. [http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/19/feb01/pgross.htmcas "Exorcising sociobiology"] ''The New Criterion'' Accessed January 20, 2007</ref> Sociologists often criticize the study for depending too greatly on the effects of genes in defining behavior. Sociobiologists often respond by citing a complex relationship between [[Nature versus nurture|nature and nurture]].

Sociology is also widely used in [[management science]], especially in the field of [[organizational behavior]].

Recent best-selling books such as ''The Tipping Point'' by [[Malcolm Gladwell]] show a revived popular interest in the discipline of sociology.
