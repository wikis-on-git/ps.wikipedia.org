يو '''پوځ''' يا يوې '''پوځي قوې''' ([[نوم|ن.]]) ته د يوه هېواد د ساتنې قوه هم وييل کېږي. پوځي قوې د تاريخ په اوږدو کې د بېلابېلو تناسخي پړاونو نه تېر شوي. پوځونه د پېړيو پېړيو راپدېخوا په بېلابېلو سيمو او ټولنو کې وه او شته. خو په لرغوني پېر کې د پوځ جوړښت ډېر ساده وه او يواځې سرتېري په تېرو لرګيو او تيږو سمبال وه، د وخت په تېرېدو سره او د انسان د پوهنيز پرمختګ سره سم د پوځونو بڼې هم بدلې شوې، يو وخت داسې هم راغی چې پوځيان په آسونو سپاره به وه او وسپنيزې وسلې لکه تورې، نيزې او ډال به ورسره وه، د ځينو سره به غشي او لينده هم وه ورو ورو د نورو لاس ته راوړنو سره د ودانيو او د وګړو د مېشت ځايونو بڼې هم بدلې شوې، د بېلګې په توګه د ښار چارپېر به خلکو دېوالونه جوړول او د پاچا لپاره به يې ټينګې کلاګانې او دنګې ودانۍ جوړولې. د وسلو بڼې هم په بېلابېلو زمانو کې بدلې شوې او پليټكښ توپكونه او توپونه راووتل چې آن پدې نوي عصر کې د ماشين ګڼو او نوي پوځي سامانو لکه ټانکونه آلوتکې او کمپيوټري جنګي آلې په پوځونږ کې نور هم انقلاب راوستی، اټکل داسې دی چې په راتلونکې کې به داسې پوځي قوتونه وي چې پوځيان او سرتېري به يې يواځې ماشينونه وي نه انسانان، خو د داسې يوې پوځې قوې شتون به د انسانانو ژوند نور هم د خطر سره مخ کړي.

==Meaning of the word==
:''Also see: [[Armed forces]]''

As an [[adjective]], "military" is a descriptive property of things related to [[soldier]]s and [[warfare]]. It also refers to such context dependent terms such as [[military reserve]]s which may indicate an actual unit deployable on command or the general sense, of a [[Nation State]]s reserve troops available to or eligible for duty in its armed forces. 

In formal [[British English]], "military" as an adjective sometimes [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20030636.htm refers] more particularly to matters relating to an army ([[land forces]]), as opposed to the [[Navy|naval]] and [[air force]] matters of the other two services.  In modern British English, whilst the term is still used in an exclusive sense, it has become common for the adjective "military" to describe all branches of the armed forces.

In [[American English]], "military" as an adjective is more widely used for regulations pertaining to and between military procurement, military transport, military justice, military strength, and military force.

== Military history ==

:''Main article: [[Military history]]''

Military history is often considered to be the [[history]] of all [[conflict]]s, not just the history of proper militaries. It differs somewhat from the [[history of war]] with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing [[technology]], [[governments]], and [[geography]].

Military history has a number of purposes. One main purpose is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future. Another is to create a sense of tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces. Still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively.

==Military Organization==

:''Main article: [[Military organization]]''

Armed forces may be organized as ''standing forces'' (e.g. [[regular army]]), which describes a professional army that is engaged in no other profession than preparing for and engaging in warfare.  In contrast, there is the ''citizen army''.  A citizen army (also known as a [[militia]] or [[reserve army]]) is only mobilized as needed.  Its advantage lies in the fact that it is dramatically less expensive (in terms of wealth, manpower, and opportunity cost) for the organizing [[society]] to support.  The disadvantage is that such a "citizen's army" is less well trained and organized.    

A compromise between the two has a small cadre of professional [[NCO]]s (non-commissioned officers) and officers who act as a skeleton for a much larger force.  When war comes, this skeleton is filled out with conscripts or reservists (former full-time soldiers who volunteer for a small stipend to occasionally train with the cadre to keep their military skills intact), who form the wartime unit.  This balances the pros and cons of each basic organization, and allows the formation of huge armies (in terms of millions of combatants), necessary in modern large scale [[war]]fare.

== Military science ==
:''Main article: [[Military science]]''

[[Military science]] concerns itself with the study and of the diverse technical, psychological, and practical phenomena that encompass the events that make up [[warfare]], especially armed combat. It strives to be an all-encompassing [[scientific]] system that if properly employed, will greatly enhance the practitioner's ability to prevail in an armed conflict with any adversary.

== Other uses of "Military" ==
===Military procurement===
Military procurement refers to common regulations and requirements for a ship or a detached unit to requisistion and draw on a base's facilies (housing, pay, and rations for detached personnel), supplies (most commonly food stocks or materials, and vehicles) by the service running a primary base; e.g. Army units detached to or staging through an [[air base]], a [[vessel]] calling at a port near an army or air base, an army unit drawing supplies from a naval base.

===Military transport===
Military transport would pertain to an equipment trans-shipped via a sister service, or an individual detached for a technical school operated by a sister service, or the travel orders and authorization of such an individual to proceed via a sister services vehicles, as well as the drawing (loan of) transportation assets ([[staff car]]s, [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle|Hum-Vees]], [[military truck]]s) operating from the primary base command.

===پوځي عدل===
[[Military law|Military Justice]], as in the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. Most nations have a separate [[code of law]] which regulates both certain activities allowed only in war, as well as provides a code of law applicable only to a [[soldier]] in war (or 'in [[uniform]]' during peacetime).

For example, in the [[United States]], the [[statutory law]]s set down by  [[United States Congress|Congress]] to apply to the ''individual conduct'' within any ''military force'' of the [[United States]] are known as the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].  The code includes specific articles under which a soldier or sailor would be tried for infractions ranging from minor ([[Late Return]], [[petty theft]]) to severe ([[Rape]], [[Murder]]); this code is usually referred to by the [[acronym]] [[UCMJ]].

===Military strength===
Military strength is a term that describes a [[quantification]] or reference to a nation's standing military forces or the capacity for fulfillment of that military's role. For example, the military strength of a given country could be interpreted as the number of individuals in its [[armed forces]], the destructive potential of its [[arsenal]], or both. For example, while [[People's Liberation Army|China]] and [[Military of India|India]] maintain the largest armed forces in the world, the [[U.S. Military]] is considered to be one of the world's strongest, although the certainty of such a claim cannot be ascertained without a detailed analysis of opposing military forces in relation to one another as well as taking into account the field(s) of [[battle]] and [[military tactics|tactics]] used in such a conflict. The [[UK]] and in some regards [[Israel]] have also been described as the best trained and operating militaries in the world.{{fact}}

===پوځي قوه===
Military [[force]] is a term that might refer to a particular unit, a [[regiment]] or [[gunboat]] deployed in a particular locale, or as an aggregate of such forces (e.g. "In the [[Gulf War]] the [[United States Central Command]] controlled ''military forces'' (units) of each of the five military services of the United States.")....

===Military brat===
[[Military Brat]] (or simply Brat) refers to a child with at least one parent who served full-time in the [[armed forces]]. It implies that such an upbringing is different in important ways from that experienced by those in the community at large.  The term ''brat'', when used in this context, is neither subjective nor derogatory.

Major books for understanding the role of the military, and the civilian leadership of the military.

# [[Why the Allies Won]] ([[World War II|WWII]]) by [[Richard Overy]] ISBN 0-393-03925-0
## Many books about [[World War II|WWII]], and other wars, focus on the military battles and campaigns. This one focuses on support roles that gave the [[Allies]] the edge when the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] seemed to be ahead in so many senses.
## [[Russia]] relocated their industry far from the front.
## There was a structure of [[Scientific Management]] in the U.S.A., unheard of in the [[Axis Powers]].
## [[Axis Powers|Axis]] nations military, particularly in [[Japan]], had an adversarial relationship that was more important to them than the best interests of their nations.
## [[Allied]] interception of coded radio signals, and strict secrecy of what they learned from this.
## [[Allied]] sophisticated deception.
### Misleading [[Germany]] about the [[Normandy]] invasion.
### Commando raids were exceptionally successful, such as in figuring out how [[German Radar]] functioned, so as to get the correct dimensions for [[Chaff]] to [[Forgery|Spoof]] it, but they were trumpeted as failures so as not to tip off [[German Military Intelligence]] about the purpose of the raids.
## In [[Nazi Germany]] scientific and military technologies developed by Jews where not trusted by Nazi government officials. This is one reason why the Nazis did not pursue development of the [[Atomic Bomb]].
# [[The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Pentagon]] by [["Jeff Cateau"]] and [[Michael Levin]]. An entertaining explanation of the U.S. military and how it is run.
# '''Get Yamamoto''' by Burke Davis, Published by Random House in 1969. During WW II, the U.S.A. intercepted top secret communications about a tour of forward bases to be conducted by Admiral [[Yamamoto]], commander of the Japanese Navy. This led to a successful mission to intercept his flight and kill him, the theory being that the Japanese would be handicapped without his leadership.
