}}<!--END INFOBOX-->

'''Lebanon''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: لبنان Lubnān), officially the '''د لېبنان جمهوريت''', is a small, largely [[mountainous]] country in the [[Middle East]], located at the eastern edge of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is bordered by [[سوريه]] to the north and east, and [[اسرايل]] to the south, with a narrow [[coastline]] along its western edge. The [[flag of Lebanon]] features the [[Lebanon Cedar]] in green against a white backdrop, with two quarter-height horizontal red stripes on the top and bottom.

The name Lebanon (also "Loubnan" or "Lebnan") is derived from the [[Semitic]] root ''LVN'', meaning "white", a reference to snow-capped [[Mount Lebanon]].
In [[British English]], the country was formerly sometimes referred to with the definite article as ''the Lebanon'', like ''the [[Ukraine]]'' or ''[[the Gambia]]'', derived from the literal translation from the Hebrew "HaLevanon" (e.g Deuteronomy 3:25)

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د لېبنان تاريخ}}
=== د خپلواکۍ لاس ته راوړنه او بايلنه ===
The country gained independence in 1943, and [[France|French]]  troops withdrew in 1946. Lebanon's history from independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil (including a [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|civil conflict in 1958]]) interspersed with prosperity built on [[Beirut|Beirut's]] position as a regional center for finance and trade.

=== د 1975-1990 جګړې ===
{{main|Lebanese Civil War}}

Until the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], [[Beirut]], the [[capital]] of Lebanon, was noted for its wide [[boulevard]]s, [[France|French]]-style architecture, and modernity, and was called "the [[Paris]] of the [[Middle East]]." Lebanon as a whole was known as the [[Switzerland]] of the [[Middle East]] (''Swisra Ash Shark''), enjoying a similar [[armed conflict|conflict]]-free status as [[Costa Rica]] in [[Central America]] and (until recently) [[Uruguay]] in [[South America]].
* The term "civil war" is not adequate due to the complexity and foreign (Israeli-Palestinian-Syrian) military forces role in the 1975-1990 war.

==== د جګړې پيل ====
After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli conflict]], Lebanon became home to more than 110,000 [[Palestinian]] refugees who had fled from [[Israel]]. More Palestinian refugees arrived after the [[1967 Arab-Israeli war]] and [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]]. By 1975 they numbered more than 300,000 with [[Yassir Arafat]]'s [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in charge of their political and military activities. During the early 1970s, difficulties arose over the increase of Palestinian refugees in the south.  Initially, fighting began between these Palestinians (referred to as "anti-Lebanese militias" by some) and the indigenous Lebanese "leftists" (the communists and socialist parties). As the fighting intensified, the sides involved became more distinct. On one side was the Christian resistance led first by [[Bachir Gemayel]] and later by [[Samir Geagea]]. The other side comprised a coalition of Palestinian refugees, [[Sunni Muslim]], and [[Druze]] forces who were united in their detestation of the 1943 National Pact. The (civil) war left the nation with no effective central government.

==== د سوريې دخالت او يرغل ====
[[دوتنه:Map of Lebanon.png|right|د لېبنان نخشه]]

In June, 1976 [[Syria]] sent 40,000 [[Military of Syria|troops]] into Lebanon to prevent the [[Maronite]] militias from being overrun by Palestinian forces. Together the Syrians and Maronites pushed the Palestinians out of [[Beirut]] and into southern Lebanon. Over the next few years, shifting political climates resulted in Syria being allied with the Palestinians and some of the Maronites allied with Israel. Syrian forces remained in Lebanon, effectively dominating its government and occupying the country until 2005.

==== First Israeli invasion and occupation ====
Cross-border attacks by [[Palestinian]] groups in southern Lebanon against civilians in [[Israel]]i territory led to an invasion by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) on [[March 14]], [[1978]] in what was titled the [[Litani River Operation]]. A few days later, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed resolutions [[UN Security Council Resolution 425|425]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 426|426]], calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces, removal of the militant Palestinian forces, and establishing an international peace-keeping force in southern Lebanon, the [[United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon]] (UNIFIL). Three months later, on [[June 13]], [[1978]], Israel completed the withdrawal of its troops, and turned over control of southern Lebanon to the pro-Israeli [[South Lebanon Army]].  The Pro-Palestinian forces including [[Hizbollah]] have remained in the region in violation of the UN cease fire agreement.

==== Second Israeli invasion and occupation ====
The PLO's armed forces continued to use Lebanon as a base to attack Israel with [[rockets]] and [[artillery]], and on [[June 6]], [[1982]] Israel again [[1982 Invasion of Lebanon|invaded Lebanon]] with the objective of evicting the PLO.  Israeli forces occupied areas from the southern Lebanese [[border]] with Israel northward into areas of [[Beirut]]. During this invasion the Phalangist militia, under the command of [[Elie Hobeika]], moved into the [[Sabra and Shatila]] refugee camps,  and committed the first [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]. Israel's plans for Lebanon suffered a severe setback on [[September 14]], [[1982]], with the assassination of the Phalangist leader and [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President-elect]] [[Bachir Gemayel]], who was regarded as secretly sympathetic to Israel.

Israel withdrew from the "security zone" in the spring of [[2000]], under the Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], who formerly ruled over the security zone as Chief of Staff. Israel continues to control a small area called [[Shebaa Farms]], which Lebanon and Syria claim to be Lebanese territory but Israel insists to be former Syrian territory with the same status as the [[Golan Heights]]. The United Nations has determined that Shebaa Farms is not part of Lebanon. The UN Secretary-General [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html concluded] that, as of [[16 June]], [[2000]], Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]] of 1978, bringing, in the UN's opinion, closure to the 1982 invasion.

Despite common belief, there has been no formal declaration of war between Lebanon and Israel throughout the past conflicts, although on [[13 July]] [[2006]] officials in both countries called recent engagements "act[s] of war". The two countries do not maintain any open ties and rely on third parties to be intermediaries in any disputes.

==== International mediation ====
A multinational force landed in [[Beirut]] on [[August 20]], [[1982]] to oversee the PLO withdrawal from Lebanon, and US mediation resulted in the evacuation of Syrian troops and PLO fighters from Beirut.

This period saw the rise of radicalism among the country's factions, and a number of landmark [[terrorism|terrorist attacks]] against American forces, including the [[April 1983 US Embassy bombing|destruction of the US Embassy]] by a [[truck bomb]] and an even deadlier [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|attack on the US Marines barracks]].

1988 and 1989 saw unprecedented chaos.  The Parliament failed to elect a successor to President [[Amine Gemayel]] (who had replaced his slain brother Bachir in 1982), whose term expired on [[23 September]].  Fifteen minutes before his term expired, Gemayel appointed an interim administration headed by the [[Military of Lebanon|army]] commander, General [[Michel Aoun]].  His predecessor, [[Selim al-Hoss]], refused to accept his dismissal in Aoun's favour.  Lebanon was thus left with no president, two rival governments that feuded for power, and more than 40 private militias.

==== End of the war ====
The 1989 [[Arab League]]-sponsored [[Taif Agreement]] marked the beginning of the end of the military war, but neither the end of the Syrian occupation nor the economic war against Lebanon. It is estimated that during the 15 year military war more than 100,000 were killed, and 100,000 maimed. The legitimacy of the Taif agreement was contested by a portion of the population who viewed it as means to institutionalize a confessional political system. Popular protests occurred intermittently between 1989 and 1990 in support of the stand taken by the 1989 interim prime minister in Lebanon, General Michel Aoun. The General Michel Aoun demanded the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces as a condition to having free parliamentary elections; the goal of the then-interim government. He contested these two occupations as justified by so-called “internal confessional conflict”, which was more of a series of foreign military manipulations. In October 1990 the Syrian occupation drove the head of the interim government, the General Aoun, into exile to Paris and the Lebanese patriotic movement he led moved underground until the Syrian withdrawal in 2005. 

On [[May 25]] [[2000]], [[Israel]] unilaterally completed its withdrawal from the south of Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978. On [[September 2]], [[2004]], the [[United Nations Security Council]], recalling previous resolutions, especially 425 (1978), 520 (1982) and 1553 (July 2004), approved [[UN Security Council Resolution 1559|Resolution 1559]], sponsored by the US and [[France]]. The resolution suggests that "all foreign forces should withdraw from Lebanon" to allow for free elections. Although not explicitly mentioned, the aim of the resolution was to invoke a withdrawal of Syrian forces. The enactors of the Taif agreement however did not enact the clause asking the Syrian occupation to withdraw from Lebanon, or heed the UN Security Council’s decision. The Lebanese patriotic movement has intensively lobbied for the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon since 1989 in governments throughout the western world. This withdrawal was catalyzed in its final stage by the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in 2005.

==== Reconstruction ====
The country is recovering from the effects of the war, with foreign investment and tourism on the rise.  Syrian forces [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|occupied]] large areas of the country until April 2005 (see ''[[Cedar Revolution]]'' below), and Iran exercises heavy influence over [[Hezbollah]] forces in the [[Beqaa Valley]] and Southern Lebanon.  <!---There has been a marked exodus of Christian Lebanese from the country. source?--->  Nevertheless, areas of Lebanon and Beirut in particular are moving toward a sense of normality and stability. Lebanese civil society enjoys significantly more freedoms than elsewhere in the [[Arab world]]. After twelve years, the reconstruction of downtown Beirut is largely complete. Lebanon's telecommunication rehabilitation is well underway, and in 2004 and 2005 foreign investment in the country topped $1 billion. [[Solidere]] has also announced many projects that will be complete in 2007.

=== Cedar Revolution (Uprising of Independence) ===
{{main|Cedar Revolution}}

Note: International media coined the term "Cedar Revolution", but Lebanese media also uses the term "[[Intifada]] (uprising) of Independence."

==== Hariri assassination ====

On [[February 14]], [[2005]], after 10 years of relative political stability, Lebanon was shaken by the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] in a car-bomb explosion. It is widely believed that [[Syria]] was responsible for the attack, due to its extensive military and intelligence presence in Lebanon, and to the public rift between Hariri and [[Damascus]] over the Syrian-backed constitutional amendment extending pro-Syrian President Lahoud's term in office. Syria, however, denies any involvement. Some sources also suggest a cover up of criminal evidence by Lebanese authorities, or that Israel's [[Mossad]] was somehow involved to inflame the Syrian-Lebanese situation. The timing of this bomb coincided with the announcement of the provisional Election results in Iraq released the previous day, in which the US backed candidate failed to win, and so may also have been timed to distract from that event.

On [[June 2]], [[2005]], the journalist and historian [[Samir Kassir]], also a founding member of the [[Democratic Left (Lebanon)|Democratic Left Movement]] was assassinated by a car bomb.

Less than one month later, on [[June 21]], [[2005]], [[George Hawi]], the former secretary general of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] was also assassinated by a [[car bomb]] in [[Beirut]]. 

On [[September 25]], [[2005]], there was a failed assassination attempt on a Lebanese Broadcasting Corp News Anchor, in which [[May Chidiac]] lost her left leg below the knee, her left arm was severely injured and was amputated. Since then, May Chidiac won the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize 2006.

On [[December 12]], [[2005]], the journalist Gebran Tueni, editor-in-chief and CEO of the An-Nahar newspaper, was assassinated by a car bomb in the suburbs of Beirut.

==== Demonstrations ====
The assassination of Hariri resulted in huge anti-Syrian protests by Lebanese citizens in [[Beirut]] demanding the resignation of the pro-Syrian government. Following the examples of the [[Rose Revolution]] and [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, the popular action was dubbed the "[[Cedar Revolution]]" by the US State Department, a name which quickly caught on among the international media. On [[February 28]], [[2005]], with over 70,000 people demonstrating in Martyrs' Square, Prime Minister [[Omar Karami]] and his Cabinet resigned. They remained in office temporarily in a caretaker role prior to the appointment of replacements, as outlined by the constitution.

In response, [[Hezbollah]] organized a large counter-demonstration of 1.2 million people [http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=7326], staged on [[March 8]] in Beirut, supporting [[Syria]] and accusing [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] of meddling in internal Lebanese affairs. 

On [[March 14]], one month after Hariri's assassination, throngs of people rallied in Martyrs' Square in Lebanon with up to 1.5 million people, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,150333,00.html]. Protestors of all sects (even including a number of Shiites) marched demanding the truth about Hariri's murder and independence from Syrian occupation. The march reiterated their desire for a sovereign, democratic, and unified country, free of Syria's hegemony.

In the weeks following the demonstrations, bombs were detonated in Christian areas near Beirut. Although the damage was mostly material, these acts demonstrate the danger of Lebanon relapsing into sectarian strife.

Eventually, and under pressure from the international community, Syria withdrew its 15,000-strong army troops from Lebanon. The last Syrian uniformed soldier left Lebanon on April 26, 2005. On [http://www.democracyinlebanon.org/Press/PR04.htm April 27, 2005], the Lebanese celebrated their first [http://www.democracyinlebanon.org/Documents/CDL-Exclusives/PostLiberation.htm free-from-Syria day].

==== Parliamentary elections ====
After weeks of unsuccessful negotiations to form a new government, Prime Minister [[Omar Karami]] resigned the post for the third time in his political career on [[13 April]] [[2005]].  Two days later, [[Najib Mikati]], a US-educated millionaire businessman and former Minister of Transportation and Public Works, was appointed Prime Minister-designate.  A moderate pro-Syrian, Mikati secured the post through the support of the Opposition, which had previously boycotted such negotiations.

During the first parliamentary elections held after Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2005, the anti-Syrian coalition of [[Sunni]] Muslim, [[Druze]] and [[Christian]] parties led by [[Saad Hariri]], son of assassinated ex-Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]], won a majority of seats in the new Parliament.  

The combinations were interesting in that in some areas the anti-Syrian coalition allied with [[Hezbollah]] and others with [[Amal Party (Lebanon)|Amal]]. They did not win the two-thirds majority required to force the resignation of Syrian-appointed President Lahoud voted for by Rafic Hariri parliamentary bloc, due to the unexpectedly strong showing of retired army general [[Michel Aoun]]'s [[Free Patriotic Movement]] party in [[Mount Lebanon]]. Aoun is arguably the strongest Christian figure in the new parliament: known previously for his anti-Syrian sentiment, Aoun aligned with politicians who were friendly to the Syrians in the past decade: [[Soleiman Franjieh Jr]] and [[Michel Murr]]. Their alliance dominated the north and the Metn District of Mount Lebanon. Saad Hariri and Walid Joumblat joined forces with the two staunchly pro-Syrian Shiite movements, Hezbollah and Amal, to secure major wins in the South, Bekaa, and Baabda-Aley district of Mount Lebanon. This alliance proved temporary and the last vestiges of civility between Joumblatt, who has called for the disarmament of Hezbollah, and the Shi'ite coalition came crashing down in December 2005. On [[February 6]], [[2006]], Hezbollah signed a memorandum of understanding with Michel Aoun.

==== New government ====
After the elections, Hariri's [[Future Movement]] party, now the country's dominant political force, nominated [[Fouad Siniora]], a former Finance Minister, to be Prime Minister. His newly formed representative government has obtained the vote of confidence from the parliament despite the lack of representation of Gen. Aoun.

On [[July 18]], [[2005]], Lebanon's newly elected parliament, dominated by an anti-Syrian coalition, approved a motion to free [[Samir Geagea]], who had spent most of the past 11 years in solitary confinement in an underground cell with no access to news. The motion was endorsed by pro-Syrian Lebanese President [[Emile Lahoud]] the next day. 
The following months proved the government's inability to begin the economic and political reforms promised to the people. Little has been done to pull the country out of the economic crisis in which it lingers still. Whilst the government loses credibility, the opposition, mainly comprised of Amal and Hezbollah (who are part of the government) and Gen. Aoun, is growing in popularity, even amongst other comunities than Christians and Shi'as. Since the beginning of May, a series of demonstrations and strikes began to appear, proof of the people's discontent.

==== Criminal investigation ====
On [[September 1]], [[2005]], four current and former officials of Lebanon—the former head of General Security Maj Gen [[Jamil Sayyad]], the former chief of police Maj Gen [[Ali Hajj]], the former military intelligence chief Brig Gen [[Raymond Azar]], and the commander of the [[Republican Guard Brigade (Lebanon)|Republican Guard]] Brig Gen [[Mustafa Hamdan]] -- were charged in connection with Hariri's assassination.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4206530.stm]

On October 21, [[Detlev Mehlis]], lead investigator in the UN Hariri Probe, released the report of the investigation. The report said that "many leads point to the direct involvement of Syrian Officials". 
<!-- neither BBC, nor UN report say anything about Maher Assad. Only Assad mentioned is Syrian president Bashar Assad -->
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4362698.stm]

Following the appointment of Mehlis' successor, the Belgian Serge Brammertz, in January 2006 the investigation has taken a different course after the new investigator decided to throw out evidence upon which Melhis had earlier relied. Brammertz' investigation has been conducted in a far more discreet manner and has been marked by a considerable more positive tone between the UN team and Damascus. Brammertz' 30-page report of June 2006 accused no specific party of perpetrating the crime, while asking for the investigation's mandate to be extended for another year [http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/syriablog/2006/06/brammertz-report-is-bust-syrians.htm].

=== Withdrawal of Syrian troops ===

Major General [[Jamil Sayyed]], the top Syrian ally in the Lebanese security forces, resigned on [[April 25]], [[2005]].  The following day the last 250 Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon.

During the departure ceremonies, Syria's Chief of Staff Gen [[Ali Habib]] said that Syria's president had decided to recall his troops after the Lebanese army had been "rebuilt on sound national foundations and became capable of protecting the state."

UN forces led by [[Senegalese]] Brig Gen [[Mouhamadou Kandji]] were sent to Lebanon to verify the military withdrawal which was mandated by [[UN Security Council Resolution 1559]].

=== Conflict with Israel ===
{{main|2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}

The 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict or 2006 Hezbollah-Israel conflict is a series of ongoing military actions and clashes in northern [[Israel]] and Lebanon involving [[Hezbollah]]'s armed wing and the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].

== سياست ==
{{د لېبنان سياست}}
{{main|د لېبنان سياست}}

Lebanon is a [[republic]] in which the three highest offices are reserved for members of specific religious groups:

* the [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] must be a [[Maronite]] [[Catholic]] [[Christian]].
* the [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] must be a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], and 
* the [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Lebanon|Speaker]] of the [[Parliament of Lebanon|Parliament]] must be a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a Muslim]].

This arrangement is part of the "[[National Pact (Lebanon)|National Pact]]" ([[Arabic]]: الميثاق الوطني - ''al Mithaq al Watani''), an unwritten agreement which was established in 1943 during meetings between Lebanon's first president (a Maronite) and its first prime minister (a Sunni), although it was not formalized in the [[Constitution of Lebanon|Constitution]] until 1990, following the [[Taif Agreement]].  The pact included a promise by the Christians not to seek French protection and to accept Lebanon's "Arab face", and a Muslim promise to recognize independence and legitimacy of the Lebanese state in its 1920 boundaries and to renounce aspirations for union with Syria.  This pact was thought at the time to be an interim compromise, necessary until Lebanon formed its own sense of a national identity. Its continued existence and the fallout from subsequent civil wars continue to dominate politics in Lebanon.

The pact also stipulated that seats in the Parliament would be allocated by religion and region, in a ratio of 6 Christians to 5 Muslims, a ratio based on the 1932 [[census]], which was taken at a time when Christians still had a slight majority.  The [[Taif Agreement]] adjusted the ratio to grant equal representation to followers of the two religions.

The [[Constitution of Lebanon|Constitution]] grants the people the right to change their government. However, from the mid-1970s until the parliamentary elections in 1992, civil war precluded the exercise of political rights. According to the constitution, direct elections must be held for the parliament every four years. The last parliament election was in 2000; the election due to be held in 2004 was postponed for one year. 

The parliament composition is based more on ethnic and religious identities rather than ideological features. The distribution of parliament seats has been modified recently.

{{Parliament of Lebanon}}
The Parliament elects the President of the republic to a six-year term.  Consecutive terms for the president are forbidden.  This constitutional rule has been bypassed by ad-hoc amendment twice in recent history, however, at the urging of the Syrian government.  [[Elias Hrawi|Elias Hrawi's]] term, which was due to end in 1995, was extended for three years.  This procedure was repeated in 2004 to allow [[Emile Lahoud]] to remain in office until 2007.  Pro-democracy campaigners denounced the moves.

The last presidential election was in 1998. The President appoints the Prime Minister on the nomination of the Parliament. Lebanon has numerous [[List of political parties in Lebanon|political parties]], but their role is less important than in most parliamentary systems.  Most represent, in practice if not in theory, sectarian interests; many are little more than ad-hoc lists of candidates endorsed by a well-known national or local figure.  Electoral tickets are often formed on a constituency-by-constituency basis by negotiation among local leaders of clans, religious groups, and political parties; these loose coalitions generally exist only for the election and rarely form cohesive blocs in the Parliament subsequently.

Lebanon's judicial system is based on the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Juries are not used in trials. The Lebanese court system has three levels - courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance.  Lebanese law does not provide for [[Civil marriage]] (although it recognizes such marriages contracted abroad); efforts by former [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] [[Elias Hrawi]] to legalize civil marriage in the late 1990s foundered on objections mostly from [[Muslim]] clerics.

== اداري وېش ==
Lebanon is divided into six [[governorate]]s (''mohafazat'', singular - ''mohafazah''), which are further subdivided into 25 [[districts]] (''Aqdya'', singular - ''[[qadaa]]''), also divided into several municipalities englobing a group of cities or villages.

== جغرافيه ==
{{main|د لېبنان جغرافيه}}

A [[Middle East]]ern country, Lebanon is bordered on the west by the [[Mediterranean]] (Coast: 225&nbsp;km; and to the east by the [[Syro-African Depression]]. Lebanon borders [[Syria]] for 375 kilometres to the north and to the east and [[Israel]] for 79 kilometres to the south. The border with Israel has been approved by the [[United Nations]] (see [[Blue Line (Lebanon)]]), although a small piece of land called [[Shebaa Farms]] located in the [[Golan Heights]] is claimed by Lebanon but occupied by Israel, who claim that it is actually Syrian land. The UN has officially declared this region to be Syrian and not Lebanese territory, but [[Hezbollah]] occasionally launches attacks against Israeli positions within it, under the banner of freeing Lebanese territory.<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:LebCed01.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Cedar Grove in Lebanon]] -->

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|د لېبنان اقتصاد}}

Lebanon has a competitive and [[free market]] regime and a strong [[laissez-faire]] commercial tradition. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth sectors include banking and tourism. There are no restrictions on foreign exchange or capital movement, and bank secrecy is strictly enforced.
There are practically no restrictions on foreign investment.

The 1975-1991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic [[infrastructure]], cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a [[Middle East]]ern [[entrepot]] and [[bank]]ing hub. Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in [[Beirut]], begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange.

Lebanon has witnessed a growth in the past couple of years. Bank assets have reached over 70 billion dollars. Even though Lebanon was down 10% in the tourism sector in 2005, more than 1.2 million tourists visited Lebanon. Market capitialization is at an all time high. Capitialization reached over $7 billion at the end of January 2006. However, a major economic decline is expected as a result of the Israeli strike of July 2006. {{fact}}

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Lebanon}}

The population of Lebanon is composed of three predominant ethnic groups and religions: [[Muslim]]s ([[Shia Islam|Shi'ites]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], [[Alawite]]s), [[Druze]], and Christians (mostly [[Maronites|Maronite Catholics]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholics]], [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholics]], some [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syrian]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] and [[Latin Rite]] Catholics, Arabic-speaking [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], [[Syrian Orthodox]], and a few [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrians]], [[Coptic Christianity|Copts]] and [[Protestants]]). No official census has been taken since 1932, reflecting the political sensitivity in Lebanon over confessional (religious) balance. It is estimated that about 60% of the resident population are Muslims; the rest are Christians.[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/le.html]  There used to be a small minority of [[Jews]], mostly living in the eastern region of Beirut. Also, a small community (less than 1%) of Kurds (also known as Mhallamis or Mardins) live in Lebanon. There are approximately 15 million people of Lebanese descent, mainly Christians, spread all over the world, [[Brazil]] being the country with the biggest Lebanese community abroad. Lebanese are of mixed descent. They possess Phoenicican, Aramaic/Syriac, Greek, Roman, European (Crusaders, mainly French) and Arabic elements.
While 360,000 [[Palestinian]] refugees have registered in Lebanon with the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) since 1948, estimates of those remaining range between 180,000 and 250,000.   

The urban population, concentrated mainly in [[Beirut]] and [[Mount Lebanon]], is noted for its commercial enterprise. A century and a half of migration and return have produced Lebanese commercial networks around the globe from [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] to [[Europe]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and [[Africa]]. Lebanon has a high proportion of skilled labor compared with many other Middle Eastern countries.

Lebanon has been a major crossroads of civilizations for millennia, so it is unsurprising that this small country possesses an extraordinarily rich and vibrant culture. Lebanon's wide array of ethnic and religious groups contributes to the country's rich [[Lebanese cuisine|cuisine]], musical and literary traditions, and festivals. [[Beirut]] in particular has a very vibrant arts scene, with numerous performances, exhibits, fashion shows, and concerts held throughout the year in its galleries, museums, theaters, and public spaces. Lebanese society is modern, educated, and perhaps comparable to European societies of the Mediterranean. Lebanon is a member state of the [[La Francophonie|Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]]. This is why most Lebanese are bilingual, speaking [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]]; however, [[English language|English]] has become popular, especially among university students. The country is not only where Christianity intermingles with Islam, but Lebanon is also an Arab gateway to Europe and a European bridge to the Arab world. 

Lebanon also hosts [[List of universities in Lebanon|several prestigious universities]], including the Lebanese University, the [[American University of Beirut]], the [[Université Saint-Joseph]], and the [[Lebanese American University]].

Several international festivals are held in Lebanon, featuring world-renowned artists and drawing crowds from Lebanon and abroad. Among the most famous are the summer festivals at [http://www.baalbeck.org.lb Baalbek], [http://www.beiteddine.org Beiteddine], and [http://www.byblosfestival.org Byblos].
