In [[geography]], a '''country''' is a geographical region. The term is often applied to a political division or the territory of a [[Sovereign state|state]], or to a smaller, or former, [[political division]] of a geographical region. Usually, but not always, a country coincides with a [[sovereign territory]] and is associated with a [[Sovereign state|state]], [[nation]] and [[government]].

''The country'' can also mean the [[countryside]], as opposed to the [[city]].

In common usage, the term country is used in the sense of both nations and states, with definitions varying. In some cases it is used to refer both to states and to other political entities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s22.html |title=Acts Interpretation Act 1901 - Sect 22: Meaning of certain words |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/federal%5fct/1997/912.html |title=The Kwet Koe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs &amp; Ors [1997&#93; FCA 912 (8 September 1997)|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/84411.pdf |title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 2—General |format=PDF |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> while in some occasions it refers only to states<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm| title=Geography: Country, State, and Nation |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Rosenberg |first=Matt}}</ref> It is not uncommon for general information or statistical publications to adopt the wider definition for purposes such as illustration and comparison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/country.aspx?countryid=96&countryName=countryid=96&countryName=Greenland |title=Greenland Country Information |publisher=Countryreports.org |accessdate=2008-5-28 web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html |title=The World Factbook - Rank Order - Exports |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/countries.cfm |title=Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/topten.cfm |title=Index of Economic Freedom - Top 10 Countries |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2007_RegionA_Asia-Pacific.pdf |title=Asia-Pacific (Region A) Economic Information |format=PDF |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://umich.edu/news/happy_08/HappyChart.pdf |title=Subjective well-being in 97 countries |format=PDF |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref>

Some cohesive geographical entities, which were formerly sovereign states, are commonly regarded and referred to still as countries; such as [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] – in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="Lib of Congress">{{Cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/uk.php|title=Legal Research Guide: United Kingdom - Law Library of Congress (Library of Cong|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2009-09-22|work=Library of Congress website|quote=The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the collective name of four countries, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Former states such as [[Bavaria]] (now part of Germany) and [[Piedmont]] (now part of Italy) would not normally be referred to as "countries" in contemporary English. The degree of autonomy of non-state countries varies widely. Some are possessions of states, as several states have overseas [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] (such as the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[American Samoa]]), with territory and citizenry distinct from their own. Such dependent territories are sometimes listed together with independent states on lists of countries, and may be treated as a "[[country of origin]]" in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is. Some countries are divided among several states, such as [[Silesia]] and [[Kurdistan]].

== Etymology and development of the word ==
Country has developed from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''contra'', meaning "against", used in the sense of "that which lies against, or opposite to, the view", i.e. the landscape spread out to the view. From this came the [[Late Latin]] term ''contrata'', which became the modern [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[contrada]]''. The term appears in [[Middle English]] from the 13th century, already in several different senses.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862 |title = country
}}</ref>

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] - "a country" - is now a [[synonym]] for [[Sovereign state|state]], in the sense of sovereign territory.<ref>[[OED]], Country</ref> Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), "Constable Country" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the "big country" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.<ref name="oed">{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862
}}</ref>

The equivalent terms in French and [[Romance language]]s (''pays'' and variants) and the [[Germanic language]]s (''Land'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", and in many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Länder]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic unities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]]. At the same time the United States and Brazil are also "pays" in everyday French speech.

A version of "country" can be found in the modern French language as ''contrée'', based on the word ''cuntrée'' in [[Old French]]<ref name="oed" />, that is used similarly to the word "pays" to define regions and unities, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.
