[[Anemia]] and [[sleep apnea]] are relatively common conditions that can contribute to ischemic myocardium and [[hyperthyroidism]] can cause a 'relative' ischemia secondary to high output heart failure.  Individuals with ischemic cardiomyopathy typically have a history of [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), although longstanding ischemia can cause enough damage to the [[myocardium]] to precipitate a clinically significant cardiomyopathy even in the absence of myocardial infarction. In a typical presentation, the area of the heart affected by a myocardial infarction will initially become [[necrotic]] as it dies, and will then be replaced by [[myocardial scarring]] ([[fibrosis]]). This fibrotic tissue is akinetic; it is no longer muscle and cannot contribute to the heart's function as a pump. If the akinetic region of the heart is substantial enough, the affected side of the heart (i.e. the left or right side) will go into [[heart failure|failure]], and this failure is the functional result of an ischemic cardiomyopathy. 

In some individuals, severe emotional stress may lead to "[[takotsubo cardiomyopathy]]", a specific cardiomyopathy which has a particular [[aetiology]].

===Cardiomyopathy due to systemic diseases===
Many diseases can result in cardiomyopathy. These include diseases like hemochromatosis, (an abnormal accumulation of iron in the liver and other organs), amyloidosis (an abnormal accumulation of the amyloid protein), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, lysosomal storage diseases and the muscular  dystrophies.

==Intrinsic cardiomyopathies==

{{seealso|myocarditis}}

An intrinsic cardiomyopathy is weakness in the muscle of the heart that is not due to an identifiable external cause.  To make a diagnosis of an intrinsic cardiomyopathy, significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out (amongst other things).  The term intrinsic cardiomyopathy does not describe the specific [[etiology]] of weakened heart muscle.  The intrinsic cardiomyopathies consist of a variety of disease states, each with their own causes.

Intrinsic cardiomyopathy has a number of causes including [[medication|drug]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]] toxicity, certain [[infection]]s (including [[Hepatitis C]]), and various [[genetics|genetic]] and [[idiopathic]] (i.e., unknown) causes.

Intrinsic cardiomyopathies are generally classified into four types,<ref name="ref2" /><ref name="ref3">{{cite web | last = Cardiomyopathy Association | title = About cardiomyopathy | url = http://www.cardiomyopathy.org/html/about_cardio.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-28}}</ref> but additional types are also recognized:

* [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] (DCM), the most common form, and one of the leading indications for [[heart transplantation]]. In DCM the heart (especially the [[left ventricle]]) is enlarged and the pumping function is diminished. Approximately 40% of cases are familial, but the [[genetics]] are poorly understood compared with HCM.  In some cases it manifests as [[peripartum cardiomyopathy]], and in other cases it may be associated with alcoholism.
* [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (HCM or HOCM), a [[genetic disorder]] caused by various [[mutation]]s in genes encoding [[sarcomere|sarcomeric]] proteins. In HCM the heart muscle is thickened, which can obstruct blood flow and prevent the heart from functioning properly.
* [[Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy]] (ARVC) arises from an electrical disturbance of the heart in which heart muscle is replaced by fibrous scar tissue. The [[right ventricle]] is generally most affected.
* [[Restrictive cardiomyopathy]] (RCM) is an uncommon cardiomyopathy. The walls of the ventricles are stiff, but may not be thickened, and resist the normal filling of the heart with blood. A rare form of restrictive cardiomyopathy is the [[obliterative cardiomyopathy]], seen in the [[hypereosinophilic syndrome]]. In this type of cardiomyopathy, the myocardium in the apices of the left and right ventricles becomes thickened and fibrotic, causing a decrease in the volumes of the ventricles and a type of restrictive cardiomyopathy.
* [[Noncompaction cardiomyopathy]] has been recognized as a separate type since the 1980s. The term refers to a cardiomyopathy where the left ventricle wall has failed to grow properly from birth and has a spongy appearance when viewed during an echocardiogram.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms and signs may mimic those of almost any form of heart disease. Chest pain is common. Mild myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is frequently asymptomatic; severe cases are associated with heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic embolization. Manifestations of the underlying disease (e.g., Chagas' disease) may be prominent. Most patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis report a recent viral prodrome preceding cardiovascular symptoms.

ECG abnormalities are often present, although the changes are frequently nonspecific. A pattern characteristic of left ventricular hypertrophy may be present. Flat or inverted T waves are most common, often with low-voltage QRS complexes. Intraventricular conduction defects and bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, are also common. An echocardiogram is useful to detect wall motion abnormalities or a pericardial effusion. Chest radiographs can be normal or can show evidence of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly.

==درملنه==
Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy, but may include medication, implanted [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|defibrillators]], or [[ventricular assist device]]s (LVADs), or [[ablation]]. The goal of treatment is often symptom relief, and some patients may eventually require a [[heart transplant]]. Treatment of cardiomyopathy (and other heart diseases) using alternative methods such as [[stem cell therapy]] is commercially available but is not supported by convincing evidence.

==Famous cases==
In 1966, the addition of [[cobalt]] compounds to stabilize [[beer foam]] in Canada led to cardiomyopathy, which came to be known as ''beer drinker's cardiomyopathy''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Cobalt | author = Donald G.
