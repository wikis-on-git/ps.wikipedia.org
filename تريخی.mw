The '''gallbladder''' (or '''cholecyst''', sometimes '''gall bladder''') is a pear-shaped [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that stores about 50 ml of [[bile]] (or "gall") until the body needs it for digestion. 

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Diagram Needed.svg|thumb|75px|right|Biliary tract]]
The gallbladder is about 7-10 cm long in humans and appears dark green because of its contents (bile), rather than its tissue. It is connected to the [[liver]] and the [[duodenum]] by the [[bile duct|biliary tract]].

* The [[cystic duct]] connects the gallbladder to the [[common hepatic duct]] to form the [[common bile duct]].

* The common bile duct then joins the [[pancreatic duct]], and enters through the [[ampulla of Vater|hepatopancreatic ampulla]] at the [[major duodenal papilla]].

==Microscopic anatomy==
The different layers of the gallbladder are as follows: 
* The [[gallbladder]] has a [[Simple columnar epithelium|simple columnar]] [[epithelium|epithelial]] lining characterized by ''recesses'' called Aschoff's recesses, which are pouches inside the lining. 
* Under the epithelium there is a layer of [[connective tissue]] (''lamina propria'').
* Beneath the connective tissue is a wall of [[smooth muscle]] (''muscularis muscosa'') that contracts in response to [[cholecystokinin]], a [[peptide]] [[hormone]] secreted by the [[duodenum]].
* There is essentially no [[submucosa]] separating the connective tissue from [[serosa]] and [[adventitia]].

==Function==
The [[gallbladder]] stores about 50&nbsp;ml of bile (1.7 US [[fluid ounce]]s / 1.8 Imperial fluid ounces), which is released when [[food]] containing fat enters the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]], stimulating the [[secretion]] of [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK).  The bile, produced in the [[liver]], [[emulsifies]] fats and neutralizes acids in partly digested food. 

After being stored in the gallbladder, the bile becomes more concentrated than when it left the liver, increasing its potency and intensifying its effect on fats. Most digestion occurs in the duodenum.

==Role in disease==

* [[Cholestasis]] is the blockage in the supply of [[bile]] into the digestive tract. It can be "intrahepatic" (the obstruction is in the liver) or "extrahepatic" (outside the liver). It can lead to [[jaundice]], and is identified by the presence of elevated [[bilirubin]] level that is mainly [[Conjugated system|conjugated]].

* [[Biliary colic]] is when a [[gallstone]] blocks either the common bile duct or the duct leading into it from the gallbladder. 

* Up to 25% of all people have [[gallstone]]s ([[cholelithiasis]]), composed of [[lecithin]] and [[bile acid]]s. These can cause abdominal pain, usually in relation with the meal, as the gallbladder contracts and gallstones pass through the [[bile duct]].  

* Acute or chronic [[inflammation]] of the [[gallbladder]] ([[cholecystitis]]) causes [[abdominal pain]].  90% of cases of acute cholecystitis are caused by the presence of gallstones. The actual inflammation is due to secondary infection with bacteria of an obstructed gallbladder, with the obstruction caused by the gallstone.

* When [[gallstone]]s obstruct the common [[bile duct]] ([[choledocholithiasis]]), the patient develops [[jaundice]] and [[liver]] cell damage. It is a medical emergency, requiring [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] or [[surgery|surgical]] treatment such as a [[cholecystectomy]].

* A rare clinical entity is [[ileus]] (bowel) obstruction by a large gallstone, or [[gallstone ileus]]. This condition develops in patients with longstanding gallstone disease, in which the gallbladder forms a [[fistula]] with the digestive tract. Large stones pass into the bowel, and generally block the gut at the level of [[Treitz' ligament]] or the [[ileocecal valve]], two narrow points in the digestive tract. The treatment is surgical.

* [[Cancer of the gallbladder]] is a rare but highly fatal disease. It has been associated with gallstone disease, [[estrogen]]s, cigarette smoking, [[alcohol and cancer|alcohol consumption]] and [[obesity]]. Despite aggressive modern surgical approaches, advanced imaging techniques, and [[endoscopy]], nearly 90% of patients die from advanced stages of the disease and experience pain, [[jaundice]], weight loss, and [[ascites]].

* [[Polyp (medicine)|Polyp]]s (growths) are sometimes detected during diagnostic tests for gallbladder disease. Small gallbladder polyps (up to 10 mm) pose little or no risk, but large ones (greater than 15 mm) pose some risk for cancer, so the gallbladder should be removed. Patients with polyps 10 mm to 15 mm have a lower risk but they should still discuss removal of their gallbladder with their physician. Of special note is a condition called [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], which causes inflammation and scarring in the bile duct. It is associated with a lifetime risk of 7% to 12% for gallbladder cancer. The cause is unknown, although primary sclerosing cholangitis tends to strike younger men who have [[ulcerative colitis]]. Polyps are often detected in this condition and have a very high likelihood of malignancy.
