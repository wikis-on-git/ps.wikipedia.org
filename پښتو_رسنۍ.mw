Pashto is not only the name of a language, but it comprises all traditions, norms and values of the [[Pashtun people]].  As for history of [[Pashto language]] is concerned, it comprises thousands of years, but we can find the proper written Pashto poetry in 139 [[Hijri]]. However, it does not mean that before this there was no poetry. [[Poetry]] existed, but not in a proper written form.  Poets usually did poetry orally and then they and their followers and fans memorized the work.  For a generation or two their work used to be remained in minds of people and afterwards it would slowly raze of the people’s minds.  Its main reasons, first, is that many of the Pashtuns at that time were [[nomad]]s, second, virtually all the Pashtoon territory was under war for many years as even [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was to grapple here for three years.  Due to these and many other reasons Pashto language was used only for the purpose of communication and no such literary work existed at that time. But oral Pashto poetry was there even before 139 [[Hijri]].

Beginning of written poetry: The formal writing of Pashto poetry started from the poem written by [[Hakim Amir Crore]] of [[Ghor]], [[Afghanistan]] in 139 [[Hijri]].  This poem was included and hence saved in one of the first books of Pashto, [[Pata Khazana]].  Amir Crore belonged to the [[Suri]] tribe and he was the son of Amir Polad. Soori tribe was the royal tribe of Ghor, Afghanistan.  His poem was a pure Pashto poem and mature as well. That’s why we can say at that time Pashto poetry had passed through an evolutionary phase.  [[Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani]] was another poet of that period. He was born at [[Helmand]] in 223 Hijri.  He was the student of [[Ullema of Basat]].  It is also said that he was the student of popular Arabic writer, [[Ibn-e-Khalid]].  Hashim Sarwani also translated some Arabic poems in Pashto as well. Sarwani’s work also came under light through the book, Pata Khazana.  He also wrote a book, [[SaloVagma]], meaning ‘deserted breeze’ on the eloquence of Arabic verses. After Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani, [[Sheikh Razi]] is another poet whose work is saved in the book, Pata Khazana. He belonged to the [[Lodhi]] tribe of Pashtuns. Similarly we have many poets in the first phase of Pashto poetry. For instance; Amir Nasir Lodhi, Beat Neeka, Ismail ster bani (son of Beat Neeka), Kharshaboon (cousin of Ismail ster bani), Sheikh Asad Soori and so on.!

Intellectual, scholars and critics divide Pashto literature into two parts, i.e. poetry and prose. The matter of fact is that Pashto literature mostly consists of poetic expressions.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Historical collection indicates that primeval Pashto literature was basically in poetic form.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Poetic literature like [[Amir Crore Nazam]] and [[Sheikh Mati Munajat]] were all in poetic form. Prose found its place in Pashto literature very late. The reason is that poetry is a far common and effective genre for translating and expressing one’s feeling into it and conveying the same to others.  However prose vis-à-vis poetry appeals to a very selective mind and heart. Now the question arises as to when prose writing came into vogue in Pashto literature. There are various profound claims and arguments regarding the origin of prose in Pashto literature like it having been originated as back as 223 HIJRI in the form of translation of Arabic verses in book titled ‘SaloVagma’ (Deserted Breeze). Since the book is not vogue and the idea is based on mere assumption, it cannot be taken as authentic. Similarly, another book [[Tazkiratul Aulia]], written by [[Suleman Makoo]] in 612 Hijri, is said to be the first recognized book in Pashto. The book contains descriptions of major [[Aulia]], like Shiekh Malkair (R.A), Shiekh Ismial (R.A) and Sheikh Bakhtiar (R.A). The complete book is not in existence but a part of it is available. However, the oldest complete prose book in Pashto that is still in existence today is [[Khairul Bayan]]. After that we come across [[Akhund Darvez]]’s book title [[Makhzanul Islam]] and various other books written in the 9th and 10th centuries by [[Babu Jan]], [[Mlamast Zamand]], [[Allah Yar]], and [[Akhun Qasim]]. But all these books were in prose-verse as they contained difficult words and rhetorical expressions and poetic rhythms as well. After that comes the era of the great Pashto poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], who along with his family has made a remarkable contribution to Pashto prose writing. His sons, one of his daughters, Haleema Khatak and his grandchildren (Khushaal Khan Khatak’s) contributed to Pashto prose in an especially unique way. It was this period when prose was written in clear, short and easy to follow and comprehensible form. Then comes the period of some of the greatest prose writers [[Saleh Mohammad]], [[Ghulam Mohyuddin Afghan]], [[Zamarley]], [[Maulvi Mir Ahmed Shah]], and [[Abdul Rauf Qaney]] further contributed to the cause of Pashto prose in Afghanistan. To conclude, Pashto expressions far more exceeds prose collections in Pashto literature as prose needs special attention on the part of intellectuals and critics and as this very form of expression is less developed in prose vis-à-vis poetry.

==پښتو اكادمي او پښتو ادبيات==
The [[Pashto Academy]] was established in 1955 in [[Peshawar]], the capital city of [[NWFP]]. The founder of the academy was [[Maulana Abdul Qadir]] who since his student-life was very concerned about the future of [[Pashto language]]. He was a scholar in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]] and Pashto. Before the establishment of the academy, there was no such plate form for the writers and poets of Pashto language from where their work could reach to the masses. The establishment of the Academy helped give writers and intellectuals that plate form, as well as helping the Pashto written word adopt a certain discipline. The academy publishes a quarterly magazine, [[Pashto magazine|PASHTO]], providing an establishment of appreciation for the Pashto prose form.

Positive impact of the Pashto Academy on Pashto literature: The Pashto academy has played an important role in the development of Pashto language as the total number of books published after the establishment of the Pashto Academy are many-fold more than the number of books published in the past 1200 years of literary history of Pashto language. To conclude, we can say Pashto literature, especially, Pashto poetry is on its peak as the Pashto poets are not afraid to write [[Ghazal]], couplet or to do any kind of poetry, containing four, six or eight [[stanzas]].

[[Syed Rahat Zakheili]] was not only a novelist and fiction writer of Pashto language, but Pashto first journalist who through journalism served the Pashto literature. To develop the Pashto literature, he started a weekly newspaper. “[[Afghan (newspaper)|AFGHAN]]” and appreciated the Pashto poets and writers through the weekly. Unlike other language newspapers, Pashto journalism started to develop the Pashto literature, so we can easily say that there was a strong link between Pashto literature and Pashto journalism and the journalism started as to help develop the Pashto literature. The editor of the weekly, AFGHAN was [[Syed Abdullah Shah Kaka Khiel]]. Before AFGHAN Pashto journalism existed, but not in a regular and disciplined way. For instance, [[Al Jihad (newspaper)|Al Jihad]], one page newspaper owned by [[Abdul Ghaffar Peshawari]] used to be published under the editorship of Ghazi Abdul Ghafoor of Swat. Haji Sab Torakzai established a [[Litho]] press (printing press) in Tribal areas in 1915 during the ‘Jihad’ against Britain. Through this press special kind of pamphlets against the Britain used to publish and distributed among the people of the tribal areas. Similarly, [[Al Mujahid (newspaper)|Al Mujahid]] was another Pashto newspaper which started publishing in 1923 under the editorship of Maulvi Muhammad Bashir. This newspaper also used to publish in the tribal areas and printed material against the Britain. ‘Zalmi Pashtoon’ was another daily newspaper which used to publish in 1933 and ‘Hamdard Afghan’ would publish in 1929 under the editor ship of Khan Mir Hilali. During these days, Mohammad Nawaz Khatak started ‘WATAN’ that was a weekly newspaper.

===اوسني پښتو ورځپاڼي===
Two main dailies of Pashto language are [[Wahdat]] and [[Khabroona]]. ‘Wahdat’ started its publication in '80s during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghan war]] for the purpose to create a link between Pashtoons living on the Pakistan-Afghan border.

Khabroona is another daily newspaper of Pashto language that started in 2001-02. Khabroona is relatively new, but it is also read in Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, suburbs of Peshawar and in Kabul, Afghanistan. Editorial policy of the newspaper is quite free and liberal as well vis-à-vis Wahdat. The newspaper is not under any governmental pressure. The content of the newspaper is quite different from Wahdat, as it gives enough space to sports and show-biz news. As for its ad policy, the newspaper publishes government and private sector ads. The head offices of both Wahdat and Khabroona are in Peshawar.

===د پښتو مجلو تاريخ===
The regular publication of magazines in Pashto language started when the owner of the weekly Afghan, Rahat Zakheili, started the magazine, [[Stari Mashi]] in 1931. During those days another magazine, [[Pashtoon (magazine)|Pashtoon]] started under the editorship of Abdul Khaliq. And then some other people found the environment conducive for magazines reading and started the magazines like [[Selab]] and [[Angar]] on regular bases. During the world war-II, a magazine, [[Nan Paroon]] was published from [[Delhi]] under the editorship of Maulana Abdul Qadir and barrister Nasrullah Khan. [[Khyber Magazine]], a magazine published from [[Government Islamia College]], Peshawar in the '50s played a great role to project the views and problems of students on one hand and to promote Pashto literature on the other hand. Some other magazines which have their own fundamental and historical place in Pashto journalism are [[Qand]], [[Adal]] , [[Qandeel]] and [[Tamas]]. These magazines have ceased publication.

[[Radio Kabul]] is the official radio station of [[Afghanistan]]. The first radio transmitters were installed in [[Kabul]] in the 1920s. In 1925, a 200 [[watt]] Russian transmitter operating at [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] 833 [[kHz]] was installed in Kabul Palace by King [[Amanullah Khan]]. The transmitter was replaced in 1931 by King [[Mohammed Nadir Khan|Mohammed Nader Khan]], and was upgraded in 1940 when a new 20 [[kilowatt]] transmitter was installed in its place, operating at 600 kHz. Programs were broadcast in Pashto and several other languages.

In the meantime, in 1935, [[Radio Pakistan, Peshawar]] started its programs in a small single room. The first word broadcasted from Radio Pakistan Peshawar was Kalma-e-Tauheed. Radio had great importance during these days because there were no newspapers or televisions, people listened to radio not only for news but for entertainment purposes as well.

Radio has an important role in the lives of the Pashtun people. Since the literacy rate is low among them, very few people are able to read newspaper, therefore, every family has a radio set in their house. Even the women in rural areas are informed and entertained by radio.

[[Image:Ali Ahmad Jalali.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ali Ahmad Jalali]] served with the [[Voice of America]] covering Afghanistan, [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]], and the [[Middle East]], including assignments as Director of the Afghan Radio Network Project and chief of the Pashto services.]] 
Pashto though mainly a language of Afghanistan and Pakistan; is spoken in many parts of the world due to the large diaspora of these two countries.  There are also a large number of Pashtuns living overseas particularly in the Middle East. Some Pashto language programs are included in the following international stations:

*[[د امريكا غږ راډيو]] 
*[[د بي بي سي راډو]] 
*[[د چين نړيواله راډيو]]
*[[د شانګهاي راډيو]]
*[[د روسيه غږ / مسكو راډيو]]
*[[د المان غږ راډيو ]]

The above radio stations broadcast different programs like ‘Khabarnama’ (news), dramas, musical, women and agricultural related programs. Similarly, most of the programs comprise literary short-dramas, discussions and mushairas.

Stations like FM Boraq and FM 101 are going very well in NWFP, especially in rural areas. The private radio stations usually discuss the problems of youth, and as a result of which they listen to it and owing to this, these private stations get more funds as compared to the station(s) supervised by the government.

The name of ''Radio Pakistan, Peshawar'' will be written in golden words in the history of radio broadcasting as it played a huge role in the development of NWFP. Not only does it broadcast entertainment programs but also programs related to the development and welfare of the province. For instance, it broadcasts programs for women development, for health, education, for children, agriculture and so on. Besides this station, there are some other private radio stations that have taken this challenge and going well as they are quite popular among the young people in the area. These stations are comparatively liberal and usually discuss problems youths face as well as education. They also discuss other social issues pertaining to the youth (i.e. relationship problems, etc).

Radio stations from international religious organizations are also broadcast into the region.  These stations tend to focus on community issues with programs about education, children, health and reconciliation.  [[Christianity in Afghanistan|Christian]] programs come from underground sources in the area or are produced by Pashtuns living outside the region <ref>[[Christianity in Afghanistan]]</ref>.

It has also been revealed that there are some illegal stations operating on the adjacent side of the [[Durand Line]]. These stations are being operated by some clerics of the area, broadcasting their narrow version of religion, issueing Fatwas (decree) against each other's sects. The government has warned them of stern actions, and has recently acquired jamming devices to block their signals.  The Pakistani government suspects that many of these cleric's may be funded by foreign intelligence agencies.

Role of film in the development of NWFP: From 1960 to 80s Pashto film enjoyed its great times. Its standard was on no grounds less than that of Urdu films till mid 70s and even 80s. If there were waheed Murad, Nadim and Mohammad Ali in Lollywood (Urdu films), so Badar Munir, Asif Khan and many others were the chocolate heroes of

== د پښتو فلم صنعت==
During these days cinema was the most effective way to communicate with the people as the standard of the movies were very good. Till mid 80s films were made on almost every subject and the people really loved to watch Pashto movies in cinema. So Pashto films played a great role in development of Pakhtoon khuwa as though cinema used to situate only in the urban areas of NWFP, but people from far flung areas came to cities like Peshawar, Mardan, and Mingora etc to watch films. Now though the standard of the Pashto film has fallen very much, but the youths, especially the rural people still love to go to cinema.

Pashto films in the 90s: Till 1990 there were some great names in the Pashto film industry. For instance, Mir Hamza Shinwari who was a producer, director and a great name in the Pashto poetry. Murad Shinwari is the one whose name comes in the list of the producers and directors who really served the Pashto industry in its real sense. Amir Ghulam Sadiq is the only name in the Pashto film industry, who did poetry for Pashto films for almost more than 30 years. But after 1990 owing to the absence of institutionalization in the Pashto film industry, there were no such dedicated people, which in intern created environment conducive to vulgarity and obscenity and the standard of the Pashto films fell.

== Pashto film and the MMA government ==
Pashto films seem to have lost their fans due to restrictions by the MMA government on their publicity through banners and posters of the film stars. The laborers who come to the provincial capital, Peshawar for manual jobs used to watch Pashto films in cinemas, but due to the bane the audience of the Pashto film has reduced tremendously because it usually comprises the laborer class who cannot even read the names of film stars. Pashto films which had a limited circuit of three cities--- Peshawar Karachi, and Quetta --- was already passing through a difficult phase and anti-obscenity drive of the MMA proved to be the last nail in the coffin.

==د پښتو فلم راتلونكي==
Future of the Pashto film industry seems to be bright as there are still some people who want to do something for the betterment of the industry. For instance, Ajab Gul, who is a renowned actor and director in both the Urdu and the Pashto film industry. In 1999 he made a film, ‘Srre Sttergae’ (red eyes) and through this film he proved that still there is a great potential in Pashto films as the story for the first time after many years was quite different and the cast, especially the heroine(s) were new and seemed that after a great hard work the film was completed. A few months back, another Pashto film, ‘Qalam au Kalashnikov’, written by Faiz Mohammad released. The standard was quite good and people liked the movie.
