== لومړني پښتو شعرونه==

پښتو نه یوازې د یوې ژبې نوم دی، بلکې په دې کې د [[پښتانه|پښتنو]] ټول دودونه، قوانین او ارزښتونه هم شامل دی. تر کومه ځايه پورې چې د [[پښتو ژبه|پښتو ژبې]] په تاريخ پورې اړه لري، د زرگونه کلونه مخکې وخت پکې راځي، خو مونږه د یوې کره ليکل شوې شاعری څرک په ۱۳۹ لېږديز کال کې مومو. اما، دا په دې مانا نده چې لدې څخه مخکې دلته کومه شاعري نه وه. شاعري وه. خو نه په یوه کره ليکلې بڼه. شاعرانو تر ډېره شعرونه په شفاهي ډول ويلي او بيا وروسته د شاعر پيروانو او مينه والو د هغه شرونه يادي کړي هم دی. د یو او دوه نسلونو خو به داشعرونه یاد ول خو بيار وروسته ورو ورو د خلکو له ذهنونو وتلي.
Its main reasons, first, is that many of the Pashtuns at that time were [[nomad]]s, second, virtually all the Pashtoon territory was under war for many years as even [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was to grapple here for three years.  Due to these and many other reasons Pashto language was used only for the purpose of communication and no such literary work existed at that time. But oral Pashto poetry was there even before 139 [[Hijri]].

Beginning of written poetry: The formal writing of Pashto poetry started from the poem written by [[Hakim Amir Crore]] of [[Ghor]], [[Afghanistan]] in 139 [[Hijri]].  This poem was included and hence saved in one of the first books of Pashto, [[Pata Khazana]].  Amir Crore belonged to the [[Suri]] tribe and he was the son of Amir Polad. Soori tribe was the royal tribe of Ghor, Afghanistan.  His poem was a pure Pashto poem and mature as well. That’s why we can say at that time Pashto poetry had passed through an evolutionary phase.  [[Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani]] was another poet of that period. He was born at [[Helmand]] in 223 Hijri.  He was the student of [[Ullema of Basat]].  It is also said that he was the student of popular Arabic writer, [[Ibn-e-Khalid]].  Hashim Sarwani also translated some Arabic poems in Pashto as well. Sarwani’s work also came under light through the book, Pata Khazana.  He also wrote a book, [[SaloVagma]], meaning ‘deserted breeze’ on the eloquence of Arabic verses. After Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani, [[Sheikh Razi]] is another poet whose work is saved in the book, Pata Khazana. He belonged to the [[Lodhi]] tribe of Pashtuns. Similarly we have many poets in the first phase of Pashto poetry. For instance; Amir Nasir Lodhi, Beat Neeka, Ismail ster bani (son of Beat Neeka), Kharshaboon (cousin of Ismail ster bani), Sheikh Asad Soori and so on.!

Intellectual, scholars and critics divide Pashto literature into two parts, i.e. poetry and prose. The matter of fact is that Pashto literature mostly consists of poetic expressions.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Historical collection indicates that primeval Pashto literature was basically in poetic form.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Poetic literature like [[Amir Crore Nazam]] and [[Sheikh Mati Munajat]] were all in poetic form. Prose found its place in Pashto literature very late. The reason is that poetry is a far common and effective genre for translating and expressing one’s feeling into it and conveying the same to others.  However prose vis-à-vis poetry appeals to a very selective mind and heart. Now the question arises as to when prose writing came into vogue in Pashto literature. There are various profound claims and arguments regarding the origin of prose in Pashto literature like it having been originated as back as 223 HIJRI in the form of translation of Arabic verses in book titled ‘SaloVagma’ (Deserted Breeze). Since the book is not vogue and the idea is based on mere assumption, it cannot be taken as authentic. Similarly, another book [[Tazkiratul Aulia]], written by [[Suleman Makoo]] in 612 Hijri, is said to be the first recognized book in Pashto. The book contains descriptions of major [[Aulia]], like Shiekh Malkair (R.A), Shiekh Ismial (R.A) and Sheikh Bakhtiar (R.A). The complete book is not in existence but a part of it is available. However, the oldest complete prose book in Pashto that is still in existence today is [[Khairul Bayan]]. After that we come across [[Akhund Darvez]]’s book title [[Makhzanul Islam]] and various other books written in the 9th and 10th centuries by [[Babu Jan]], [[Mlamast Zamand]], [[Allah Yar]], and [[Akhun Qasim]]. But all these books were in prose-verse as they contained difficult words and rhetorical expressions and poetic rhythms as well. After that comes the era of the great Pashto poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], who along with his family has made a remarkable contribution to Pashto prose writing. His sons, one of his daughters, Haleema Khatak and his grandchildren (Khushaal Khan Khatak’s) contributed to Pashto prose in an especially unique way. It was this period when prose was written in clear, short and easy to follow and comprehensible form. Then comes the period of some of the greatest prose writers [[Saleh Mohammad]], [[Ghulam Mohyuddin Afghan]], [[Zamarley]], [[Maulvi Mir Ahmed Shah]], and [[Abdul Rauf Qaney]] further contributed to the cause of Pashto prose in Afghanistan. To conclude, Pashto expressions far more exceeds prose collections in Pashto literature as prose needs special attention on the part of intellectuals and critics and as this very form of expression is less developed in prose vis-à-vis poetry.
