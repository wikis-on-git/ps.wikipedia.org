[[astronomical object|celestial bodies]] and related details is held to be useful in understanding, interpreting, and organizing information about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters. A practitioner of astrology is called an [[astrologer]], or, less often, an astrologist. Numerous traditions and applications employing astrological concepts have arisen since its earliest recorded beginnings in the 2nd millennium BCE.<ref>{{cite web| author=Robert Hand| title=The History of Astrology — Another View| url=http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm| accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> It has played a role in the shaping of culture, early astronomy, and other disciplines throughout history.

Historically, [[astrology and astronomy]] were often indistinguishable, because the desire for predictive and divinatory knowledge were the primary motivating factors in both disciplines. Astronomy began to diverge from astrology after a long period of gradual separation in the [[18th century]], and has since distinguished itself as the [[Science|scientific]] study of astronomical objects and phenomena without any concern for their supposed astrological correlation.

Astrology is variously considered by its proponents to be a [[symbolism|symbolic]] language,<ref>{{cite web| title=Astrology FAQ, Basics for Beginners and Students of Astrology| author=Michael Star| url=http://home.istar.ca/~starman/astrofaq.shtml| accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=A Transdisciplinary Approach to Science and Astrology| author=Alain Nègre| url=http://cura.free.fr/quinq/02negre2.html| accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref> a form of [[art]],<ref name="Campion">{{cite web| title=Nick Campion's Online Astrology Resource: Science & Astrology| author=Nick Campion | url=http://www.nickcampion.com/nc/science/science.htm| accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref> [[science]],<ref name="Campion"/> or [[divination]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary| publisher=Meriam-Webster| url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/astrology| accessdate=2006-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title="astrology."

The core beliefs of astrology were prevalent in most of the ancient world and are epitomized in the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] maxim "as above, so below". [[Tycho Brahe]] used a similar phrase to summarize his studies in astrology: ''suspiciendo despicio'', "by looking up I see downward".<ref>{{cite web| title=Tycho Brahe and Astrology| author=Adam Mosley| url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/tychoastrol.html | accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Although the principle that events in the heavens are mirrored by those on Earth was once generally held in most traditions of astrology around the world, in the West there has historically been a debate among astrologers over the nature of the mechanism behind astrology. The debate also covers whether or not celestial bodies are only signs or portents of events, or if they are actual causes of events through some sort of force or mechanism.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Although the connection between [[celestial mechanics]] and terrestrial [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was explored first by [[Isaac Newton]] with his development of a universal theory of [[gravitation]], claims that the gravitational effects of the celestial bodies are what accounts for astrological generalizations are not substantiated by scientific research, nor are they advocated by most astrologers.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

A common belief held by astrologers is that the positions of certain celestial bodies either influence or correlate with human affairs. A modern explanation is that the cosmos (and especially the [[solar system]]) acts as a single unit, so that any happening in any part of it inevitably is reflected in every other part, somewhat representing [[chaos theory]]. Skeptics dispute these claims, pointing to a lack of concrete evidence of significant influence of this sort.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Most astrological traditions are based on the relative positions and movements of various real or construed celestial bodies and on the construction of celestial patterns as seen at the time and place of the event being studied. These are chiefly the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], the [[Planets in astrology|planet]]s, the [[star]]s and the [[lunar node]]s. The frame of reference for such apparent positions is defined by the [[tropical astrology|tropical]] or [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]] [[zodiac]]al signs on one hand, and by the local [[horizon]] ([[ascendant]]) and [[midheaven]] on the other. This latter (local) frame is typically further divided into the twelve [[House (astrology)|astrological houses]]. Furthermore, the [[astrological aspects]] are used to determine the geometric/angular relationship(s) between the various celestial bodies and angles in the horoscope. 

The claim of astrology to predict future trends and developments, or predictive astrology, is based on two main methods: [[Astrological transit|astrological transits]] and [[Astrological progression|astrological progressions]]. In astrological transits the ongoing movements of the planets are interpreted for their significance as they transit through space and the horoscope. In astrological progressions the horoscope is progressed forward in time according to set methods. Most modern astrologers no longer try to forecast actual events, but focus instead on general trends and developments. Skeptics respond that this allows astrologers to avoid making verifiable predictions, and gives them the ability to attach significance to arbitrary and unrelated events, in a way that suits their purpose. {{Fact|date=May 2007}}

In the past, astrologers often relied on close observation of celestial objects and the charting of their movements. Modern astrologers use data provided by [[astronomer]]s which are transformed to a set of astrological tables called [[ephemeris|ephemerides]], showing the changing zodiacal positions of the heavenly bodies through time.

There are many traditions of astrology, some of which share similar features due to the transmission of astrological doctrines between cultures. Other traditions developed in isolation and hold completely different doctrines, although they too share some similar features due to the fact that they are drawing on similar astronomical sources. 

===اوسني دودونه===
The main traditions used by modern astrologers are:

*[[Jyotish|Indian astrology]]
*[[Western astrology]]
*[[Chinese astrology]]

Indian and Western astrology share a common ancestry as [[Horoscopic astrology|horoscopic systems]] of astrology and are essentially similar in content. Both traditions focus on the casting of an astrological chart or [[horoscope]], a representation of celestial entities, for an event based on the position of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the moment of the event. The main difference between the two traditions is that Indian astrology uses the [[sidereal zodiac]], linking the signs of the zodiac to their original [[constellations]], while Western astrology uses the [[tropical zodiac]] (see section below). Because of the phenomenon of the [[precession of the equinoxes]], over the centuries the twelve zodiacal signs in Western astrology no longer correspond to the same part of the sky as their original constellations. In effect, in Western astrology the link between sign and constellation has been broken, whereas in Indian astrology it remains of paramount importance.

In Chinese astrology a quite different tradition has evolved. By contrast to Western and Indian astrology, the twelve signs of the zodiac do not divide the sky, but rather the celestial equator. The Chinese evolved a system where each sign corresponds to one of twelve 'double-hours' that govern the day, and to one of the twelve months. Also most notably and uniquely, each sign of the zodiac governs a different year, and combines with a system based on the five elements of Chinese cosmology to give a 60 (12 x 5) year cycle. The term ''Chinese astrology'' is used here for convenience, but it must be recognised that versions of the same tradition exist in [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]] and other Asian countries. 

In modern times, these traditions have come into greater contact with each other, notably with Indian and Chinese astrology having spread to the West, while awareness of Western astrology is still fairly limited in Asia.
Astrology in the Western world has diversified greatly in modern times. New movements have appeared, which have jettisoned much of traditional astrology to concentrate on different approaches, such as a greater emphasis on midpoints, or a more psychological approach. Some of its subsets include:

*Modern tropical and sidereal horoscopic astrology
*[[Cosmobiology]]
*[[Psychological astrology]]
*[[Sun sign astrology]]
*[[Hamburg School of Astrology]]
**[[Uranian astrology]], subset of the Hamburg School

{{main|History of astrology}}
Throughout its long history, astrology has come to prominence in many regions and undergone developments and change. There are many astrological traditions that are historically important, but which have largely fallen out of use today. Astrologers still retain an interest in them and regard them as an important resource. Historically significant traditions of astrology include:
*[[Arab and Persian astrology]] (Medieval, near Eastern)
*[[Babylonian astrology]] (Ancient, near East)
*[[Egyptian astrology]]
*[[Hellenistic astrology]] (Classical antiquity)

The Mesoamerican traditions are included here because although they have not been widely used in their full form since pre-Columbian times, there is evidence that they have survived in some form as a living tradition up to the present day, particularly among the Maya.<ref> Ronald Wright "Time Among the Maya" Abacus Books, London 1989 </ref> Aztec and Maya astrology recall the Chinese system, but use a more complex calendar scheme. These systems offer additional evidence concerning the original migration of native peoples from Asia to America.
The history of Western, Chinese, and Indian astrology is discussed in the main article [[history of astrology]].

Many mystic or esoteric traditions have links to astrology. In some cases, like [[Kabbalah]], this involves participants incorporating elements of astrology into their own traditions. In other cases, like divinatory tarot, many astrologers themselves have incorporated the tradition into their own practice of astrology. Esoteric traditions include, but are not limited to:

*[[Classical planets in Western alchemy|Alchemy]]
*[[Chiromancy]]
*[[Kabbalistic astrology|Kabbalah]]
*[[Medical astrology|Medicine]]
*[[Astrology and numerology|Numerology]]
*[[Rosicrucian]] or "Rose Cross"
*[[Tarot reading|Tarot divination]]

Historically, alchemy in the [[Western World]] was particularly allied and intertwined with traditional Babylonian-Greek style astrology; in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for [[occult]] or hidden knowledge.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Astrology has used the concept of the four [[astrology and the classical elements|classical elements]] of alchemy from antiquity up until the present day. Traditionally, each of the seven planets in the solar system known to the ancients was associated with, held dominion over, and "ruled" a certain metal.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==The zodiac==
[[Image:Beit Alpha.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] in a 6th century [[synagogue]] at Beit Alpha, [[Israel]].]]
{{main|zodiac}}

The zodiac is the belt or band of constellations through which the Sun, Moon, and planets move on their journey across the sky. Astrologers noted these constellations and so attached a particular significance to them. Over time they developed the system of twelve [[Astrological sign|signs]] of the zodiac, based on twelve of the constellations they considered to be particularly important. The Western and Indian zodiac signs have a common origin in the tradition of horoscopic astrology, and so are very similar in meaning. In China on the other hand, the development of the zodiac was different. Although the Chinese too have a system of twelve signs (named after animals), the Chinese zodiac refers to a pure calendrical cycle, as there are no equivalent constellations linked to it like the Western or Indian zodiacs. The common choice of twelve zodiac signs is understandable when it is considered that the interaction of the Sun and Moon was central to all forms of astrology. Thus, twelve cycles of the Moon &mdash; the months &mdash; coincided with one solar year, making twelve a natural choice.
 
The majority of Western astrologers base their work on the tropical zodiac which divides the sky into twelve equal segments of 30 degrees each, beginning with the first point of Aries, the point where the line of the earth's [[celestial equator]] and the [[ecliptic]] (the Sun's path through the sky) meet at the northern hemisphere spring [[equinox]]. Due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the slow changing of the way Earth rotates in space, the zodiacal signs in this system bear no relation to the [[constellation]]s of the same name but stay aligned to the months and seasons. Because of its connection to old locations of constellations, the tropical zodiac is used as a historical coordinate system in astronomy.

Practitioners of the Indian astrological tradition and a minority of Western astrologers use the sidereal zodiac. This zodiac uses the same evenly divided ecliptic but approximately stays aligned to the positions of the observable constellations with the same name as the zodiacal signs. The sidereal zodiac differs from from the tropical zodiac by an offset called the [[ayanamsa]] which steadily increases as the equinoxes drift further.

[[Horoscopic astrology]] is a very specific and complex system that was developed in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region and specifically [[Hellenistic Egypt]] around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE.<ref> David Pingree - ''From Astral Omens to Astrology from Babylon to Bikaner'', Roma: Istituto Italiano per L'Africa e L'Oriente, 1997. Pg. 26. </ref> The tradition deals with two-dimensional diagrams of the heavens, or 'horoscopes', created for specific moments in time. The diagram is then used to interpret the inherent meaning underlying the alignment of celestial bodies at that moment based on a specific set of rules and guidelines. This is normally done for the moment of birth of an individual, or at the beginning of an enterprise or event, because the alignments of the heavens at that moment are thought to determine the nature of the subject in question. One of the defining characteristics of this form of astrology that makes it distinct from other traditions is the computation of the degree of the Eastern horizon rising against the backdrop of the [[ecliptic]] at the specific moment under examination, otherwise known as the ascendant. Horoscopic astrology has been the most influential and widespread form of astrology across the world, especially in [[Africa]], [[India]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]], and there are several major traditions of horoscopic astrology including [[Jyotish|Indian]], Hellenistic, Medieval, and most other modern Western traditions of astrology.

===فال===
[[Image:Natal Chart -- Adam.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A [[computer]]-generated Western [[horoscope]].]]
Central to horoscopic astrology and its branches is the calculation of the horoscope or astrological chart. This two-dimensional diagrammatic representation shows the celestial bodies' apparent positions in the heavens from the vantage of a location on Earth at a given time and place. The horoscope is also divided into twelve different celestial [[Astrological houses|houses]] which govern different areas of life. Calculations performed in casting a horoscope involve [[arithmetic]] and simple [[geometry]] which serve to locate the apparent position of heavenly bodies on desired dates and times based on astronomical tables. In ancient Hellenistic astrology the ascendant demarcated the first celestial house of a horoscope. The word for the ascendant in Greek was ''horoskopos'' from which "horoscope" derives. In modern times, the word has come to refer to the astrological chart as a whole.

===د فالي ستورپېژندنې څانګې===
Traditions of horoscopic astrology can be divided into four branches which are directed towards specific subjects or purposes. Often these branches use a unique set of techniques or a different application of the core principles of the system to a different area. Many other subsets and applications of astrology are derived from these four fundamental branches. 

*[[Natal astrology]], the study of a person's natal chart to gain information about the individual and his/her life experience. 
*[[Katarchic astrology]], which includes both [[Electional astrology|electional]] and event astrology. The former uses astrology to determine the most auspicious moment to begin an enterprise or undertaking, and the latter to understand everything about an event from the time at which it took place.
*[[Horary astrology]], used to answer a specific question by studying the chart of the moment the question is posed to an astrologer.
*[[Mundane astrology|Mundane or world astrology]], the application of astrology to world events, including weather, earthquakes, and the rise and fall of empires or religions.

===آر===
The origins of much of the astrological doctrine and method that would later develop in [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]] are found among the ancient [[Babylonians]] and their system of celestial omens that began to be compiled around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE. This system of celestial omens later spread either directly or indirectly through the Babylonians to other areas such as [[India]], [[China]], and [[Greece]] where it merged with pre-existing indigenous forms of astrology.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. This Babylonian astrology came to Greece initially as early as the middle of the 4th century BCE, and then around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE after the [[Alexander the Great#Period of conquests|Alexandrian conquests]], this Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of decanic astrology to create [[horoscopic astrology]]. This new form of astrology, which appears to have originated in [[Alexandria|Alexandrian Egypt]], quickly spread across the ancient world into Europe, the Middle East and India.

===د ساينسي غورځنګ نه دمخه===
From the classical period through the [[scientific revolution]], astrological training played a critical role in advancing astronomical, mathematical, medical and psychological knowledge. Astrological influences included the observation and long-term tracking of celestial objects. It was astrologers who provided the first systematic documentation of the movements of the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the stars. The differentiation between astronomy and astrology varied from place to place; they were indistinguishable in ancient Babylonia and for most of the [[Middle Ages]], but separated to a greater degree in ancient Greece (see [[astrology and astronomy]]). Astrology was not always uncritically accepted before the modern era; it was often challenged by Hellenistic skeptics, church authorities, and medieval thinkers.

The pattern of astronomical knowledge gained from astrological endeavours has been historically repeated across numerous cultures, from [[History of India|ancient India]] through the classical [[Maya civilization]] to medieval Europe. Given this historical contribution, astrology has been called a [[protoscience]] along with [[pseudoscience]]s such as [[alchemy]] (see "Western astrology and alchemy" below).

Many prominent scientists, such as [[Nicholas Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Carl Jung]] and others, practiced or significantly contributed to astrology.<ref>{{cite web | title=Were They Astrologers? — Big League Scientists and Astrology | author=Bruce Scofield | publisher=The Mountain Astrologer magazine | url=http://www.mountainastrologer.com/scofield.html | accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref>

==Effects on world culture==
{{main|Cultural influence of astrology}}

Astrology has had a profound influence over the past few thousand years on Western and Eastern cultures. In the middle ages, when even the educated of the time believed in astrology, the system of heavenly spheres and bodies was believed to reflect on the system of knowledge and the world itself below.

Astrology has had an influence on both language and literature. For example, [[influenza]], from medieval Latin ''influentia'' meaning influence, was so named because doctors once believed epidemics to be caused by unfavorable planetary and stellar influences. The word "disaster" comes from the Latin ''dis-aster'' meaning "bad star". Adjectives "lunatic" (Luna/[[Moon]]), "mercurial" ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), "venereal" ([[Venus]]), "martial" ([[Mars]]), "jovial" ([[Jupiter]]/Jove), and "saturnine" ([[Saturn]]) are all old words used to describe personal qualities said to resemble or be highly influenced by the astrological characteristics of the planet, some of which are derived from the attributes of the ancient Roman gods they are named after.  In literature, many writers, notably [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Astrology and English literature'' | author=A.

Piechoski|url=http://starcats.com/anima/shakespeare.html}}</ref> used astrological symbolism to add subtlety and nuance to the description of their characters' motivation(s). Often, an understanding of astrological symbolism is needed to fully appreciate such literature. 

Some modern thinkers, notably Carl Jung,<ref name="Jung">Carl G. Jung, "Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious," excerpted in ''The Basic Writings of C.G. Jung'' (Modern Library, repr. 1993), 362-363.</ref> believe in astrology's descriptive powers regarding the mind without necessarily subscribing to its predictive claims. In education astrology is reflected in the [[university education]] of [[medieval Europe]], which was divided into seven distinct areas, each represented by a particular planet and known as the seven [[liberal arts]]. [[Dante|Dante Alighieri]] speculated that these arts, which grew into the sciences we know today, fitted the same structure as the planets. 
In music the best known example of astrology's influence is in the orchestral suite called "[[The Planets]]" by the British composer [[Gustav Holst]], the framework of which is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets.

Although astrology has had no accepted scientific standing for some time, it has been the subject of much research among astrologers since the beginning of the twentieth century. In his landmark study of twentieth-century research into natal astrology, vocal astrology critic Geoffrey Dean noted and documented the burgeoning research activity, primarily within the astrological community.<ref name="Dean">G.

Another argument made by astrologers is that most studies of astrology do not reflect the nature of astrological practice and that existing experimental methods and research tools are not adequate for studying this complex discipline.<ref name="MUL-MVA">M.

We dont refute electronic gadgets and equipment just because it fails but we work towards finding cures for the errors."

===Research claims and counter-claims===
[[Image:Marseffect.svg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Mars effect]]: relative frequency of the [[diurnal motion|diurnal position]] of Mars in the birth chart of eminent athletes.]]

Several individuals, most notably French psychologist and statistician [[Michel Gauquelin]], claimed to have found correlations between some planetary positions and certain human traits such as vocations. Gauquelin's most widely known claim is known as the [[Mars effect]], which is said to demonstrate a correlation between the planet Mars occupying certain positions in the sky more often at the birth of eminent sports champions than at the birth of ordinary people. Since its original publication in 1955, the Mars effect has been the subject of studies claiming to refute it,<ref>Benski, C. et al. 1996. The "Mars Effect": A French Test of Over 1000 Sports Champions.</ref><ref>Zelen, M., P. Kurtz, and G. Abell. 1977. Is there a Mars effect? The Humanist 37 (6): 36-39.</ref> <ref>Herbert Neisler in ''Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, ISBN 0731657942, p3</ref> and studies claiming to support and/or expand the original claims,<ref>{{cite web | title=Raising the Hurdle for the Athletes' Mars Effect: Association Co-Varies With Eminence | url=http://www.scientificexploration.org/jse/abstracts/v2n1a4.php | author=Suitbert Ertel | publisher=Journal of Scientific Exploration}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Discussion of Mars eminence effect | url=http://www.planetos.info/mmf.html | author=Ken Irving | publisher=Planetos}}</ref><ref name="Kollerstrom">{{cite web | title=How Ertel rescued the Gauquelin effect | url=http://www.astrozero.co.uk/astroscience/koll1ge.pdf | author=N. Kollerstrom }}</ref> but neither the claims nor the counterclaims have received mainstream scientific notice.  

The scientific community,<ref name="nsa1"/> where it has commented, claims that astrology has repeatedly failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in numerous controlled studies. [[Effect size]] studies in astrology conclude that the mean accuracy of astrological predictions is no greater than what is expected by chance, and astrology's perceived performance has disappeared on critical inspection.<ref name="Psi">{{cite web | title=<nowiki>Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi?</nowiki> | author=Dean and Kelly | url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Dean.pdf}}</ref> When tested against [[personality test]]s, astrologers have shown a consistent lack of agreement with these tests. One such [[double-blind]] study in which astrologers attempted to match birth charts with results of a personality test, which was published in the reputable [[peer-reviewed]] scientific journal'' [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', concluded that astrologers' could not solve clients' personal problems by reading individuals' natal charts and that astrologers had no special ability to interpret personality from astrological readings.<ref>{{cite web | title=<nowiki>A double-blind test of astrology</nowiki> | author=Shawn Carlson | publisher=Nature, 318, 419 - 425 (05 December 1985) | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v318/n6045/abs/318419a0.html}}</ref> Another study that used a personality test and a questionnaire contended that some astrologers failed to predict objective facts about people or agree with each other's interpretations.<ref>{{cite web | title=<nowiki>The Astrotest - Correlation</nowiki> | author=Rob Nanninga | publisher=Northern Winter, 1996/97, 15(2), p. 14-20.  | url=http://www.skepsis.nl/astrot.html}}</ref> When testing for [[cognitive]], [[behavioral]], [[physical]] and other variables, one study of astrological "[[Astro-twin|time twins]]" showed that human characteristics are not molded by the influence of the Sun, Moon and planets at the time of birth.<ref name="Psi"/><ref name="wimtes">{{cite news |author = Robert Matthews |url = http://www.washtimes.com/world/20030817-105449-9384r.htm |title = Comprehensive study of 'time twins' debunks astrology|publisher = London Daily Telegraph |date = 2003-08-17 |language = English}}</ref> Skeptics of astrology also suggest that the perceived accuracy of astrological interpretations and descriptions of one's personality can be accounted for by the [[Confirmation bias|fact]] that people tend to exaggerate positive 'hits' and overlook whatever does not fit, especially when [[Forer effect|vague language is used]].<ref name="Psi"/> They also argue that statistical research is often wrongly seen as evidence for astrology due to uncontrolled artifacts.<ref>{{cite web | title=Artifacts in data often wrongly seen as evidence for astrology | url=http://www.rudolfhsmit.nl/d-arti2.htm | author=Geoffery Dean}}</ref>
