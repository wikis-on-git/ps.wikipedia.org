The '''cell theory''' is a [[scientific theory]] that is one of the foundations of [[biology]]. The generally accepted parts of cell theory include:
*The [[cell (biology)|cell]] is the fundamental unit of structure and function in living things.
*All [[organism]]s are made up of one or more cells.
*All cells come from pre-existing cells through [[cellular division]].
*Cells carry [[genetic material]] passed to daughter cells during cellular division.
*All cells are essentially the same in chemical composition.
*[[Energy flow]] ([[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]]) occurs within cells.

The three main parts of the cell theory are:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# Cells are the most basic unit for function and structure of all organisms.
# All cells come from cells that already exist.

This theory also contains two exceptions:
# Viruses are considered by some to be alive, yet they are not made up of cells.
# The first cell did not originate from a preexisting cell.

The cell theory was originally developed by [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]], and fully accepted by the work of [[Louis Pasteur]], specifically his work regarding microbes. Cells are a basic unit of biology.

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1663. He remarked that it looked strangely similar to cells in which monks inhabit. However what he actually discovered was a part of a cork (or dead plant) and what he was looking at was the empty cell walls with no nucleus in the center. The first man to witness a live cell under a microscope was [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1673.
