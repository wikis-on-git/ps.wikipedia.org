The '''Dominican Republic''', ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República Dominicana'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[re'puβlika domini'kana]}}) is a country located on the eastern two-thirds of the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] island of [[Hispaniola]], bordering [[Haiti]]. Hispaniola is the second-largest of the [[Greater Antilles]] islands, and lies west of [[Puerto Rico]] and east of [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]]. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule lasted for much of the [[20th century]]; the move towards [[representative democracy]] has improved vastly since the death of military dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] in [[1961]]. Dominicans sometimes refer to their country as '''Quisqueya''', a name for Hispaniola used by [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Taíno]] people. The Dominican Republic is not to be confused with [[Dominica]], another Caribbean country.  

== تاريخ ==
:''Main article: [[History of the Dominican Republic]]''
The country has had a history of changing ownership, with occasional attempts at independence and self-rule.  First a [[Spanish empire|Spanish colony]] and then a [[French colonial empires|French colony]], it was subsequently ruled by Haiti and then Spain again, and later the [[United States]] ruled Dominican territory with a military government from 1916-1924.

In the beginning the island was primarily inhabited by the [[Taíno]], a branch of the [[Arawaks]]. ''Taíno'' means "the good" or "noble" in that native language. A system of [[Cacique|Cacicazgos]] ([[chiefdom]]s) was in place, and Marien, Maguana, Higuey, Magua and Xaragua (Also written as Jaragua) were their names. These chiefdoms were then subdivided into subchiefdoms. The Cacicazgos were based on a system of [[tribute]], consisting of the food grown by the Taino. Among the cultural signs that they left were cave paintings around the country, which have become touristic and nationalistic symbols of the Dominican Republic, and words from their language, including "hurricane" (hurrakan) and "tobacco" (tabakko).

=== The arrival of the Guamikena (the covered ones) ===
On December 5, [[1492]], the Europeans arrived. Believing that these beings from over the horizon were in someway supernatural, the Taínos welcomed the Europeans with all the honors available to them. This was a totally different society from the one the Europeans came from.  One of the things that piqued the curiosity was the amount of clothing worn by the Europeans. Therefore they came to call them "guamikena" (the covered ones). [[Guacanagarix]], the chief who hosted [[Christopher Columbus]] and his men, treated them kindly and provided him with everything they desired. Yet the Taínos' allegedly "egalitarian" system clashed with the Europeans' feudalist system, with more rigid class structures. This led the Europeans to believe the Taínos to be either weak or misleading, and they began to treat the tribes with more violence. Columbus tried to temper this when he and his men departed from Quisqueya and they left on a good note. Columbus had cemented a firm alliance with Guacanagarix, who was a powerful chief on the island. After the shipwrecking of the Santa Maria, he decided to establish a small fort with a garrison of men that could help him lay claim to this possession. The fort was called La Navidad, since the events of the shipwrecking and the founding of the fort occurred on Christmas day. The garrison, in spite of all the wealth and beauty on the island, was wracked by divisions within and the men took sides, that evolved  into conflict amongst these first Europeans. The more rapacious ones began to terrorize the Taíno, Ciguayo and Macorix tribesmen up to the point of trying to take their women.

Viewed as weak by the Spaniards and even some of his own people, Guacanagarix tried to come to an accommodation with the Spaniards, who saw his appeasement as the actions of someone who submitted, they treated him with contempt and even took some of his wives too.  The powerful cacique of the maguana, Caonabo could brook no further affronts, attacked the Europeans and destroyed La Navidad. Guacanagarix, dismayed as he was by this turn of events did not try too hard to aid these guamikena, probably hoped that the troublesome outsiders would never return. However, they did return.

=== شلمه پېړۍ ===
The twentieth century was marked by repeated U.S. intervention in local affairs. The reason for this was the island's strategic location in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. During the World Wars the islands of the Caribbean were used as stop-off points for German [[U-boats]] from which to plan possible attacks against the North American continent. During the [[Cold War]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and capitalist ideologies clashed openly on the island. Apart from tentative U.S. support for the [[Rafael Leonidas Trujillo|Trujillo]] dictatorship (1930-1961) (though this faded during his final years), the largest example of this was the [[1965]] invasion by American troops in the midst of a Dominican civil war, an uprising that was sparked by an attempt to restore the republic's first democratically-elected president of the 20th century, [[Juan Bosch]], who had been overthrown by a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[coup]] in 1963. Following this civil war, and America's deployment of troops in [[Operation Power Pack]], [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (1966-1978) was democractically elected, winning by 57%. Juan Bosch's constitutional government never returned to power. The [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson administration]] justified the 1965 intervention by stating that it suspected many of Bosch's supporters were pro-[[Cuba]]n [[communism|Communists]]

== سياست ==
:''Main article: [[Politics of the Dominican Republic]]''

The Dominican Republic is a [[representative democracy]] whose national powers are divided among independent [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches. The [[President of the Dominican Republic|president]] appoints the cabinet, executes laws passed by the legislative branch, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president and vice president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for four-year terms.

Legislative power is exercised by a bicameral [[National Congress of the Dominican Republic|National Congress]] — the [[Senate of the Dominican Republic|Senate]] (32 members), and the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (150 members). Presidential elections are held in years evenly divisible by four. Congressional and municipal elections are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four.

:''Main article: [[Geography of the Dominican Republic]]''
The capital of the country is the city of [[Santo Domingo]] -full name Santo Domingo de Guzman, located in the south part of the island. Originally a single city located within the province Distrito Nacional (National District), it has now been divided into a Province of Santo Domingo and the National District. The Province of Santo Domingo is comprised of several municipalities: Santo Domingo Norte (North Santo Domingo), Santo Domingo Este (East Santo Domingo, which is the provincial capital), Santo Domingo Oeste (West Santo Domingo) and Boca Chica. The Ozama River serves a natural border between the National District and the Province of Santo Domingo. Thus the capital city of the Country is the City of Santo Domingo de Guzman, Province of National District. The second largest city is [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], more commonly referred to as simply Santiago.

[[دوتنه:IMG_1281.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of Juan Pablo Duarte in front of La Pelona]]

The country has three major mountain ranges: The Central Mountains (Cordillera Central), which originate in Haiti and span the central part of the island, ending up in the south. This mountain range boasts the highest peak in the [[Antilles]], [[Pico Duarte]] (3,087&nbsp;[[meter|m]] / 10,128&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] above [[sea level]]). The Septentrional Mountains, running parallel to the Central Mountains, separate the Cibao Valley and the Atlantic coastal plains. The highest point here is Pico Diego de Ocampo. The lowest and shortest of the three ranges is the Eastern Mountains, in the eastern part of the country. There are also the Sierra Bahoruco and the Sierra Neyba in the southwest. This is a country of many rivers, including the navigable Soco, Higuamo, Romana, Yaque del Norte, Yaque del Sur, Yuna, Yuma, and Bajajabonicoco.

== Demographics ==
:''Main article: [[Demographics of the Dominican Republic]]''
The majority of Dominicans are of Mixed African, European and Native American (Taino) Blood. A small presence of [[Asian]], mostly of [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] descent, and [[Middle East]]erners, mostly [[Lebanese]], can be found. Dominican culture is essentially Latin coated with a elements of [[Spain]]'s culture, like language and religion. African culture also is a major factor, with elements such as the music and Carnival testimony to the rich slave heritage.  It also has many Antilliean, European, and American influences.

Since the early [[1960s]], economic problems have led to a vast migration of Dominicans to the U.S., mainly to large east coast cities, and coming on the heels of a similar migration of [[Puerto Ricans]]. [[New York City]]'s [[Washington Heights]] is so densely populated by Dominicans, it is sometimes referred to as '' Quisqueya Heights''. ''Quisqueya'' is a popular name for Hispaniola that many believe derives from the island's original Arawak name, although this is disputed by some historians. Dominicans are now one of the largest [[Latino]] groups in the US; less numerous than the Mexican majority and Puerto Ricans, and about even with Cubans. There are also sizeable Dominican emigre communities in the [[Netherlands]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Spain]], and [[St. Maarten]].

Dominican Republic has a history of race and prejudice issues, mostly of [[mullato]]s against [[blacks]]. This phenomenon is common in the island and much more pronounced in Haiti. In recent years, illegal immigration from Haiti has dramatically increased as the Dominican economy improves and the Haitian economy remains virtually moribund. Most Haitian immigrants work at low-paying, unskilled labor jobs, including construction work and household cleaning. The Dominican sentiment towards these immigrants is frequently negative, and at times in its history, including the period during and after Haiti merged the two nations (the [[19th century]] and the reign of [[Rafael Leonidas Trujillo]]), there have been anti-Haitian pogroms, slaughtering 18,000 Haitians at the border [http://haitiforever.com/windowsonhaiti/warwh.shtml]. This also led to Dominican Republic paying Haiti $750,000 to avert war.  [http://www.thediamondangle.com/marasco/negleg/trujillo.html] Many foreigners reside in the country for business, religious, and leisure reasons, and there are significant populations of Americans, Canadians, Germans, French, and Koreans in the country.

== اقتصاد ==
:''Main article: [[Economy of the Dominican Republic]]''
The Dominican Republic is a middle-income developing country primarily dependent on [[agriculture]], [[trade]], and [[services]], especially [[tourism]]. Although the service sector has recently overtaken agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due principally to growth in tourism and [[Free Trade Zones]]), agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place (behind [[mining]]) in terms of [[export]] earnings. Tourism accounts for more than $3 billion in annual earnings. [[Free Trade Zone]] earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. [[Remittances from overseas|Remittances]] from Dominicans living abroad are estimated to be about $3 billion per year.

Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the [[GDP]] fell by up to 5% and consumer price [[inflation]] reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of moderate growth and declining inflation until 2002 after which the economy entered a [[recession]], after the second [[commercial bank]] of the country collapsed, caused by a major [[fraud]]. GDP dropped by 1% in 2003 while inflation ballooned by over 27%.

Despite a widening merchandise [[trade deficit]], tourism earnings and remittances have helped build [[foreign exchange reserves]]. The Dominican Republic is current on foreign [[Consumer debt|private debt]], and has agreed to pay arrears of about $130 million to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture's]] [[Commodity Credit Corporation]].

According to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommitee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked #71 in the world for resource availability, #94 for human development, and #14 in the world for resource mismanagement.  These statistics emphasize the national government corruption, the foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.

== پېسه ==
:''Main article: [[Dominican Peso]]''
The [[Dominican Peso]] (RD$) is the national currency of the country although the [[US dollar]] is often acceptable in some places, especially tourist oriented shops and hotels. Initially, the peso was worth the same as a [[US dollar]].  In more recent years, however, the value has decreased relative to the US dollar.  The exchange rate to the US dollar was about RD$14.00 in 1993 and RD$16.00 in 2000, but in early 2004 reached RD$54.00 per US dollar.  It ended the year 2005 at about RD$34.00 per dollar.

The exchange rate to the US dollar currently fluctuates on a daily basis, and is usually between $33.50-35.00 pesos as of February 2006. The International Monetary Fund revealed a growth of 7.6% over inflation index for 2006, which implies that the national currency of the Dominicans could naturally finish the year with a average basis between 35.70 and touching 38 per dollar roof. Another factor which would have a certain impact over the currency exchange market of Dominicana is the fluctuations of the American Dollar at international currency market.  The US dollar is implicated over almost all commercial actions of the Dominican Republic, supporting the theory that explains the devaluation of the peso in front of the dollar in 2005 is the result of the international currency market; On Feb 2005 1.32 USD = one € = 29 DR pesos, later on Oct 2005 1.19 USD = one € = 32 DR pesos. 

Multiple local economists (Andres Dahjalhe Jr. and Magda Azer, principally)and well-recognized commercial analyst firms and institutions estimated an over-evaluation of the Dominican Peso suggesting that the daily basis of the Dominican currency is artificially controled by the government, considerably bordering a free market's policies.

:''Main article: [[Culture of the Dominican Republic]]''
[[Baseball]] is the top national sport in the Dominican Republic and there are many popular Dominicans who play [[Major League Baseball]] in the U.S., including [[Albert Pujols]], [[Sammy Sosa]], [[Vladimir Guerrero]], [[Pedro Martinez]], [[David Ortiz]], [[Miguel Tejada]], and [[Manny Ramirez]].  The Dominican Republic also has its own baseball league, which many MLB players go to during off-season, and which is also a "training ground" for the MLB.

Eighty-nine percent of Dominicans are baptized in the [[Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic|Roman Catholic Church]].  Other substantial religious groups are the Evangelical Christians and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Around one percent of the nation's inhabitants practice pure spiritism, although it is very common for Catholicism and spiritism to be mixed in Santeria's seancees and "saint" parties.

The Dominican Republic is known for a form of music called [[merengue (music)|Merengue]], which has been popular since the mid- to late-[[1900s]]. It has sexually charged syncopated beats using Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass and electric guitars. What was considered unpopular to the youth, until today, is a form of folk music called [[Bachata]]. Bachata is usually slow, romantic, and [[Spanish guitar]] driven. However, bachata's rhythm can be sped up to the same [[syncopation]] as Merengue, and its called ''bacharengue''. Both genres of music are popular throughout the world. [[Reggaeton]], a style of music that orginated in Panama, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, is the dominant music of the country's youth, and defines the party lifestyle of the country. Among the most successful producers of Reggaeton music are [[Luny Tunes]] from [[La Romana]] in the Dominican Republic; Luny Tunes has produced many successfull songs of [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Tego Calderón]], [[Ivy Queen]] and [[Don Omar]]. Reggaeton is a mix of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[bomba]], and [[plena]].
