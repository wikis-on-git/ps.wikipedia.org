'''نايجېريا'''، چې په رسمي توګه '''د نايجېريا فېډرالي جمهوريت''' په نامه يادېږي، د لوېديځې افريقا يو هېواد دی چې د افريقا په لويه وچه کې يې د وګړوشمېر د ټولو نورو افريقايي هېوادونو څخه زيات دی. د نايجېريا هېواد په لويديځه خوا کې د [[بېنين]] جمهوريت، په ختيځ کې يې د [[چاډ]] او [[کېمرون]] هېوادونه، او په سهېل کې يې د [[نايجېر]] هېواد، پولې لري. همدا شان دغه افريقايي هېواد په خپل سوېل کې [[د ګوينا خليج]] سره هم لار لري. د ۱۹۹۹ ز کال نه راپدېخوا، د دغه هېواد [[پلازمېنه]] د هېواد په مېنځنۍ برخه کې پروت ښار [[ابوجا]] کې ده، او تر دې پخوا د نايجېريا هېواد دولتي مرکز په [[لاګوس]] کې وه.

The people of Nigeria have an extensive history, and based on archaeological evidence, human habitation of the area dates back to at least 9000 BC. The [[Benue River|Benue-Cross River]] area is thought to be the original homeland of the [[Bantu|Bantu migrants]] who spread across most of central and southern Africa in waves between the [[1st millennium BC]] and the [[2nd millennium AD]]. However, the Nigerian state came into being on [[October 1]], [[1960]] when Nigeria declared its independence from the British and at present consists of 36 states and the federal capital territory. Nigeria re-achieved democracy in 1999 after a sixteen-year interruption by a series of military [[dictators]]. From 1966 until 1999, Nigeria had been ruled (except the short-lived [[second republic]], 1979-1983) by military dictators who seized power in [[coup]]s and counter-coups. 

== د نوم اصل او تاريخ ==
The country's name first appeared in print in ''[[The Times]]'' in [[1897]] and was suggested by the paper's colonial editor [[Flora Shaw]] who would later marry [[Frederick Lugard]], the first Governor General of the Amalgamated Nigeria. The name comes from a combination of the words "[[Niger River|Niger]]" (the country's longest river) and "Area". Its adjective form is ''Nigeri'''a'''n'', which should not be confused with ''Nigeri'''e'''n'' for [[Niger]].

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د نايجېريا تاريخ}}
Nigeria has had a unique history. More than 2,000 years ago, the [[Nok]] people were producing sculptures. In [[Kano]] and [[Katsina]], recorded history dates back to around 1000. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] kingdoms and the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] prospered as trade posts between North and West Africa. The [[Yoruba]] kingdoms of [[Ife|Ifẹ]] and [[Oyo|Ọyọ]] were founded about 700-900 and 1400 respectively. The Ifẹ produced the terra cotta and bronze heads, the Ọyọ extended as far as modern [[Togo]]. The [[Kingdom of Benin]] developed an efficient and renowned army. The Benin (Edos)are related to the Yoruba by history.  The southeast produced the [[Onitsha]], Nri, and [[Arochukwu]] kingdoms. The Nri kingdom reigned before slavery with Divine priests and powerful Ezenri. There was also the great Ogbunka kingdom which was noted for his ability to repulse every form of aggression. A prominent town they controlled was Igbo Ukwu which was home to [[Bronze]] figures and was a burial site for Kings. Other kingdoms also flourished, like the [[Calabar]], [[Opobo]], [[Bonny]], [[Brass]], Elem kalabari and others which were controlled by the [[Ijaw]], [[Efik]], [[Igbo]], and [[Ibibio]].

Beginning in the 17th century Europeans established ports for slave trafficking. In the early 19th century the [[Fulani]] leader [[Usman dan Fodio]] united most areas in the north under the control of an Islamic [[Fulani Empire]] centred in [[Sokoto]].

The [[17th century]] brought [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders to what is now the Lagos area. In fact, the name Lagos came from the Portuguese word for lagoon, resulting in the name of the area.  However, it was the [[British Empire|British]] in the [[19th century]] that established permanent settlement and control over the region. In [[1901]], Nigeria was made a British protectorate and remained under the control of Britain until its independence in [[1960]].

Newly independent Nigeria's government was coalition of conservative parties: the [[National Party of Nigeria|Nigerian People's Congress]] (NPC), a party dominated by Northerners and those of the [[Islamic]] faith, and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-dominated [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) led by [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], who became Nigeria's maiden [[Governor-General]] in 1960. Forming the opposition was the comparatively liberal [[Action Group]] (AG), which was largely dominated by [[Yorubas]] and led by [[Obafemi Awolowo]]. The nation parted with its British legacy in [[1963]] by declaring itself a [[Federal Republic]], with Azikiwe as the first [[President of Nigeria|president]]. When elections came about in 1965, the AG was outmanouvered for control of Nigeria's Western Region by the [[Nigerian National Democratic Party]] an ammalgamation of conservative Yoruba elements backed heavily by the Federal Government amid dubious electoral circumstances. This left the Igbo NCNC to coalesce with the remnants of the AG in a weak progressive alliance.
[[دوتنه:Nigeria sm02.gif|thumb|250px|right|Map of Nigeria]] 

This disequilibrum in power led in [[1966]] to a back-to-back [[military coup]]s by regional and ethnic cabals. The first was in January led by leftists under [[General]] [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], the then-army head of Igbo extraction, who was installed as head of state. The Igbo-led coup was counter-acted by another successful plot, supported primarily by Northern military officers and engineered by [[Murtala Mohammed]], which allowed Gen. [[Yakubu Gowan]] to become head of state.

Ethnic and religious tensions following independence led to the [[Nigerian Civil War]] and the start of intermittent democratic and military rule that did not end until [[1999]], when the democratic republic was permanently re-established with the election of [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] as its current president. Recently, supporters of Obasanjo had tried and failed to extend [[term limits]] following rejection by the national assembly. New elections are set for [[2007]].

With its economy and infrastructure devastated by years of military rule, corruption, and mismanagement, Nigeria is now reforming and rebuilding itself to be a modern, prosperous nation. It is taking advantage of its position as sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country to push for a more prominent role in African and international politics. Such examples are its chairmanship of [[ECOWAS]] and the deployment of [[peace keeping]] troops to [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], and the [[African Union]] with troop deployments to the [[Sudan]]. Nigeria is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Despite these positive developments, problems abound in Nigeria such as endemic corruption and crime such as the [[419 scams]]; ethnic and religious strife, particularly between Christians and Muslims in the northern half of the country, and [[Niger Delta conflicts|insurgents]] in the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]]. The Niger Delta conflict is hampering Nigeria's oil production capabilities and is even affecting international [[oil prices]].

{{morepolitics|country=نايجېريا}}
Nigeria is a [[Democratic Republic]] modelled after the [[United States]], with [[executive power]] exercised  by the [[president]]. The president's power is checked by a [[Nigerian Senate|Senate]] and a [[House of Representatives of Nigeria|House of Representatives]], which are combined in a body called the [[Nigerian National Assembly|National  Assembly]]. There is also a [[Constitution]]. The current president of Nigeria is [[Obasanjo|Olusegun Obasanjo]] who was elected in [[1999]] following the restoration of democracy after several years of [[military dictatorship]].  

The two major parties in Nigerian politics are the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party of Nigeria]] and the [[All Nigeria People's Party]].

=== Law ===
There are four distinct systems of law in Nigeria:

*[[English Law]] which is derived from its [[British Empire|colonial]] past with Britain
*[[common law]], a development of its post colonial independence
*[[customary law]] which is derived from indigenous traditional norms and practices
*[[Sharia]] law, used only in the predominantly Hausa and Muslim north of the country

While there was some controversy with the implementation of Sharia law, the legal systems seemingly work,  although the practice of sharia is unconstitutionally forced on non Muslims.  There is a [[Judicial branch]] with a [[Supreme Court of Nigeria|Supreme Court]] which is regarded as the highest court of the land.

Nigeria is currently in better foreign relations due to its current state of democracy and with the help of the current president Obasanjo. It is a member of the [[African Union]] and sits on that organization's [[Peace and Security Council]]. Since [[1960]] Nigeria has been a member of the [[United Nations|UN]] and also joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the same year, however they were briefly suspended between [[1995]] and [[1999]]. It currently is the chair of the regional [[IGO]], [[Economic Community of West African States]] or ECOWAS and [[ECOMOG]], its military arm. Both are presently headquartered in the capital Abuja.

Nigeria is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

=== د نايجېريا پوځ ===
{{main|د نايجېريا پوځ}}

The military of Nigeria has played a major role in the country's history, often seizing control of the country and ruling it through major periods of its history. Its last period of rule ended in [[1999]] following the death of the leader of the previous military [[military dictatorship|junta]] [[Sani Abacha]] in [[1998]].

Taking advantage of its role of sub-saharan Africa's most populated country, Nigeria has repositioned its military as an African peacekeeping force. Since 1995, the Nigerian military through ECOMOG mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in [[Liberia]] (1997), [[Ivory Coast]] (1997-1999), [[Sierra Leone]] 1997-1999, and presently in [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] region under an African Union mandate. 

Active duty personnel in the three Nigerian armed services is total approximately 76,000. The [[Nigerian Army]], the largest of the services, has about 60,000 personnel deployed in two mechanized infantry divisions, one composite division (airborne and amphibious), the [[Lagos Garrison Command]] (a division size unit), and the Abuja-based Brigade of Guards. It has demonstrated its capability to mobilize, deploy, and sustain battalions in support of peacekeeping operations in [[Liberia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], [[Angola]], [[Rwanda]], [[Somalia]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. The [[Nigerian Navy]] (7,000 members) is equipped with [[MEKO|frigates]], fast attack craft, corvettes, and coastal patrol boats. The [[Nigerian Air Force]] (9,000 members) flies transport, trainer, helicopter, and fighter aircraft, but most are currently not operational. Nigeria also has pursued a policy of developing domestic training and military production capabilities. Nigeria has continued a strict policy of diversification in her military procurement from various countries.  After the imposition of sanctions by many Western nations, Nigeria turned to the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Russia]], [[North Korea]], and [[India]] for the purchase of military equipment and training.

Located in western Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, Nigeria has a total area of 356,669 [[square mile]]s <!-- Format per WP:MOSNUM -->(923,768&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]]); of that around 5,000 square miles (13,100&nbsp;km²) is water.  Nigeria has a 2,515 [[mile]] (4,047&nbsp;km) border that it shares with Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. 

The highest point in Nigeria is [[Chappal Waddi]] at 7,936&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (2,419&nbsp;m).

Nigeria has a varied landscape. From the [[Obudu Hills]] in the southeast through the beaches in the south, the [[rainforest]], the [[Lagos estuary]] and [[savanna]] in the middle and southwest of the country and the [[Sahel]] and the encroaching [[Sahara Desert]] in the extreme north.

Nigeria's main rivers are the [[Niger River|Niger]], the [[Benue]] which converge and empty out in the [[Niger Delta]], one of the world's largest river deltas.

Nigeria is also an important centre for [[biodiversity]]. It is widely believed that the areas surrounding [[Calabar]], Cross River State contain the world's largest diversity of [[butterflies]]. The [[drill monkey]] is only found in the wild in Southeast Nigeria and neighbouring [[Cameroon]].

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|د نايجېريا اقتصاد}}

Years of [[military dictatorship|military rule]], corruption, and mismanagement have hobbled economic activity and output in Nigeria and continue to do so, despite the restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reform. According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and the [[World Bank]], Nigerian [[GDP]] at [[purchasing power parity]] was only at $170.7 billion as of FY [[2005]]. The GDP per head is at $692. [http://www.economist.com/countries/Nigeria/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet]

Nigeria is a leading [[petroleum]] producer and exporter. It is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter. 
Nigeria also has one of the world's largest proven [[natural gas]] and petroleum reserves and is a founding member of [[OPEC]]. However, due to crumbling infrastructure, ongoing civil strife in the [[Niger Delta]]- its main oil producing region- and corruption, oil production and export is not at 100% capacity. 

More mineral resources that are present in Nigeria but not yet fully exploited are [[coal]] and [[tin]]. Other natural resources in the country include iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead, zinc, and arable land. Agricultural products include [[groundnut]]s, [[palm oil]], [[cocoa]], [[coconut]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[maize]], [[millet]], [[cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]] and [[sugar cane]]. It also has a booming leather and textile industry, with industries located in Kano, Abeokuta, Onitsha, and Lagos.

Like many third world nations, Nigeria has accumulated a significant foreign debt. However many of the projects financed by these debts were inefficient, bedevilled by corruption or failed to live up to expectations. Nigeria defaulted on its debt as arrears and penalty interest accumulated and increased the size of the debt. However, after a long campaign by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement that will see Nigeria's debt reduced by approximately 60%. Nigeria will use part of its oil windfall to pay the residual 40%. This deal will free up at least $1.15 billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. As of April 2006, Nigeria became the first African Country to fully pay off her debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the [[Paris Club]].

The currency unit of Nigeria is the [[Nigerian Naira]].

Nigeria also has significant production and manufacturing facilities such as factories for [[Peugeot]] the French car marker, [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] the English truck manufacturer, now a subsidiary of [[General Motors]], and also manufactures [[t-shirts]] and [[processed food]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Nigeria}}
[[دوتنه:Bevölkerungsdichte Nigerischer Bundesstaaten english.PNG|thumb|Population density in Nigeria]]
Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa but exactly how populous is the subject of speculation. The [[United Nations]] estimates that the population in [[2004]] was at 131,530,000 [http://esa.un.org/unpp/], with the population distributed as 48.3% Urban and 51.7% rural and population density at 139 people per square km. National census results in the past few decades have been disputed.

According to the United Nations, Nigeria has been undergoing explosive population growth and one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world. By their projections, Nigeria will be one of the countries in the world that will account for most of the world's total population increase by [[2050]]. [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/pop918.doc.htm]. According to current data, one out of every four Africans are Nigerian. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5072244.stm] Presently, [[World population|Nigeria is the ninth most populous country in the world]], and even conservative estimates conclude that more than 20% of the world's black population lives in Nigeria.

=== Ethnic groups ===
{{main|Ethnic groups in Nigeria}}
[[دوتنه:Nigeria linguistic 1979.jpg|thumb|[[Ethno-linguistic]] map of Nigeria]]
Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The largest ethnic groups are the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] (Ibo), [[Ijaw]], [[Kanuri]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], and [[Tiv]]. <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ni.html CIA - The World Factbook-- Nigeria]. ''Retrieved June 29, 2006.''</ref>

There are small minorities of [[Afrikaners]], [[English people|English]], [[Americans]], [[India|East Indians]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Lebanese]] and refugees and immigrants from other West African nations. These minorities mostly reside in major cities such as [[Lagos]] and [[Abuja]], or in the [[Niger Delta]] as employees for the major oil companies. A number of [[Cuba]]ns settled Nigeria as political refugees following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. A number of them include [[Afro-Cuban]]s and mixed-raced Cubans.

{{main|د نايجېريا ژبې}}
There are a total of 250 languages spoken in Nigeria which correspond with the estimated number of ethnic groups in Nigeria.

The  major languages spoken in Nigeria are [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo language|Igbo]].

=== مذهب ===
{{main|د نايجېريا مذهب}}
Nigerians adhere to a variety of religions which tend vary regionally, this situation accentuates regional and ethnic distinctions but has often times been seen as a major source of sectarian conflict amongst the population. All religions represented in Nigeria were practised in every major city in the 1990s. [[Islam]] dominates in the north with some northern states having incorporated [[Shari'a law]] amid much controversy.

[[Protestantism]] and local [[Syncretism|syncretic]] [[Christianity]] predominate in [[Yoruba]] areas, while [[Catholicism]] has a strong historical presence amongst the [[Igbo]] and closely-related ethnic groups. Indigenous Beliefs such as [[Orisha]] and [[Voodou]] are still widely held amongst the Yoruba and other ethnic groups in the southwest of the country. Recently however, such worship has undergone significant decline, as many adherents are being converted to Christianity. Christianity is undergoing a major resurgence in the country, particularly following visits by Pope [[John Paul II]] in the 1990s.

[[Judaism]] is also present in Nigeria, practised largely by people of the Igbo ethnic group (see [[Jews of Nigeria]]) who have an oral tradition of having originated from certain of the  [[Lost tribes of Israel]]. [http://www.rabbihowardgorin.org/Ibo-Benei-Yisrael.pdf]

Nigerian music includes many kinds of [[folk music|folk]] and [[popular music|popular]] music, some of which are known worldwide. Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of [[Demographics of Nigeria#Ethnic groups|ethnic groups]] in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments and songs. As a result, there are many different types of music that come from Nigeria. Many late 20th century musicians such as [[Fela Kuti]] have famously fused cultural elements of various [[indigenous music]] with American [[Jazz]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] to form [[Afrobeat]] music. [[Jùjú music|JuJu]] music which is [[percussion]] music fused with traditional music from the [[Yoruba]] nation and made famous by [[King Sunny Ade]], is also from Nigeria. There is also a budding [[Nigerian hip hop|hip hop]] movement. World famous musicians that come from Nigeria [[Fela Kuti]], [[Femi Kuti]], [[King Sunny Ade]], [[Ebenezer Obey]]. Nigeria has been called "the heart of [[music of Africa|African music]]" because of its role in the development of West African [[highlife]] and [[palm-wine music]], which fuses native rhythms with techniques imported from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]] and elsewhere.

The Nigerian Film Industry also known as [[Nollywood]] is famous throughout [[Africa]]. Many of the [[film studio]]s are based in Lagos and Abuja and the industry is now a very lucrative income for these cities. As opposed to [[cinemas]], the industry relies heavily on selling [[VCD]]'s or what are often known as home movies. The movies are normally based around domestic issues though some have ventured further, this has led to some commentators branding the story lines as being trite.

This was Nigeria's poorest World Cup outing; they were defeated in their first two games, but managed to get 1 point through a 0 - 0 draw with England.

==== Best International Outing ====
Nigeria's best outing was in the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta 1996 Olympics]] defeating Brazil 4 -3 in the semi-finals and finishing with a 3 - 2 win over Argentina in the gold medal game.

== Societal issues ==
Despite its vast government revenue from the mining of petroleum, Nigeria is beset by a number of societal problems due primarily to a history of inept governance. Some of these problems are listed below.

=== Crime ===
Nigeria is widely associated with international [[419 scams]] or advance fee fraud, a fraudulent scheme to extract money from victims.  The basic operation is the scammer contacts a potential victim (usually at random) by fax, e-mail or traditional paper mail, claiming to have an enormous amount of money that they are having trouble moving from one country to another.  The reasons given vary widely, including war, political unrest, or economic necessity.  The scammer flatters the victim, making it appear as if they have searched for and found the ideal partner who can be loyal and trusting.  They ask to use the victim's bank account to transfer the money, and in return they will give the victim a significant portion of the fortune.  People who respond to the scam are then told a fee (usually bank or customs) is necessary to complete the transaction, which the victim will need to pay.  From there it is stretched out to however much money the victim supplies.  The success rate for these scams can be as low as 1%, but with the Internet the scammers can send out an enormous number of contacts.  Some victims have lost their entire savings, and a few who have traveled to Nigeria, either to confront the scammers or to further participate in it, have been killed.    

The origin of the 419 scam is currently debated, but the term "419" is based on the section it is written under in Nigerian law (section 419). Many critics believe that the scam slowly began in Nigeria, possibly developing from earlier forms of fraud practised by Nigerian [[petroleum]] companies, criminal gangs, and government agencies in the [[1970s]] or [[1980s]]. The modern 419 scam well predated the widespread use of e-mail, and earlier variants were often sent via fax or even [[Telex]]. In recent years the 419ers as they are also known, have come to use the [[internet]] as a major tool for their scam, whereas before letters or phone calls were used.

Another increasingly common aspect of internet crime that is strongly associated with Nigeria is [[romance scam]]ming whereby victims are targeted on dating websites and internet chatrooms. The perpetrators are very presentable, claim to be westerners working or visiting Nigeria temporarily, usually post (stolen) photos of physically attractive individuals and can be incredibly charming, often persistently pursuing their victims for many months so as to induce feelings of love. Once in the romantic grip of the perpetrator, he (almost always a man)confesses that he cannot make the trip home to be united with his online lover for a wide range of reasons but mainly because he has not been able to cash his pay checks in Nigeria. They therefore request the victim to help them by cashing these checks and sending the money to Nigeria so as to to assist their beloved make it to them (victim). Of course the checks are either stolen or forged and the perpetrator never shows up and the victim is left with a broken heart and many thousands of pounds of debt.

A new version of scam, which so far has not been named, involves consumer goods for sale by private sellers at online websites, typically electronics like games or cameras.  The seller is contacted and told the buyer is interested in purchasing the item for a friend (or relative, a wide variety of false pretenses are used) who is in Africa.  The country turns out to almost invariably be Nigeria.  If the buyer follows through, payment is typically made by a stolen credit card or false money order that bounces.  Often the money order is for an amount greater than the purchase price, so that when the victim cashes it they send out both the item that  was "purchased" and additional money.

More sophisticated schemes have the scammer issuing forged e-mails that appear to come from a payment service, promising payment once a shipment tracking number is supplied.  Some scammers resort to outright extortion, claiming to have paid for an item that was never sold, and anticipating the seller will cave in to their demands.  

The failure of the Federal Government to exercise effective law enforcement has led to the emergence of numerous popular vigilante groups. Some, such as the [[Bakassi Boys]] in southeastern Nigeria, enjoy the open endorsement of state governments.

=== Public health ===
While the [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] rate in Nigeria is much lower compared to the other African nations, because of its large population, Nigeria has a much higher percentage of total HIV/AIDS patients worldwide as it currently the third highest in the world. [http://www.avert.org/aids-nigeria.htm] Nigeria, like many developing countries, also suffers from a [[Polio]] crises as well as periodic outbreaks of [[Cholera]], [[Malaria]], and [[Sleeping Sickness]]. As of [[2004]], there has been a vaccination drive spearheaded by the [[World Health Organization|W.H.O]] to combat [[Polio]] and [[Malaria]] that was met with controversy in some regions.

===Strife and sectarian violence===

Due to its multitude of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria has been beset since prior to independence with sectarian tensions and violence. This is particularly true in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. The civilian population, and especially certain ethnic groups like the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]], has experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction. However, when these groups have attempted to protest these injustices, they have been met with repressive measures by Nigerian government and military forces. As a result, strife and deterioration in this region continues [[as of 2006]].
	 
There are also significant tensions on a national scale, especially between the primarily [[Islamic]], highly conservative northern population and the more liberal [[Christianized]] and indigenous groups who reside in the south. Extant animosity between major social groupings was exacerbated during the colonial era, as the [[British Empire|British]] utilized divide and rule tactics to subdue and facilitate governance over a diverse and agitated population. Following the victory of the Nigerian state in the [[Nigerian Civil War]] during the 1960s, when the largely [[Igbo]] southeast attempted to secede and form the independent nation of [[Biafra]].

Since the ending of the civil war in [[1970]], racial and religious violence has continued. Violence between Christians and Muslims (usually Igbo [[Christians]] and [[Hausa]] or [[Fulani]] [[Muslims]]) has been incessant.

In [[February 2006]], Muslims in Northern Nigeria protesting [[caricatures]] of the [[Prophet Muhammed]] (published in [[Denmark]], see: [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammed cartoons controversy]]) attacked Christians and burned churches in violence that left dozens dead or injured. A majority of the dead were Igbo's of Christian or Jewish extraction.

In [[2004]], in the city of [[Kano]] (Nigeria's largest Muslim city) angry young Muslim men attacked "nonbelievers" with machetes, while others burned cars, stores and apartments. The violence came hours after thousands of Muslim protesters — some carrying daggers, sickles and clubs — marched from the main mosque in the northern city. Muslim Hausa-speaking men armed with sticks, knives and clubs were searching cars for Christians and animists asking passengers to recite Muslim prayers.

In 2002, organisers of the [[Miss World|Miss World Pageant]] announced that they would move the pageant from the Nigerian capital, [[Abuja]], to [[London]] in the wake of violent protests in the Northern, Muslim part of the country that left more than 100 people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after a newspaper suggested the Prophet Muhammed would have approved of the Miss World beauty contest because the women looked "beautiful". The death toll in the town of [[Kaduna]] was an estimated 105 with a further 521 injured taken to hospital. Angry mobs in the mainly Muslim city 600 kilometres (375 miles) northwest of Lagos burnt Christian churches and rampaged through the streets stabbing, bludgeoning and burning bystanders to death.

Courtesy of the oil boom years of the 1970s, tertiary education was expanded to reach every subregion of Nigeria. The Federal Government and the State Governments were previously the only bodies licensed to operate universities in Nigeria. Recently, licenses have also been granted to individuals, corporate bodies and religious bodies to establish private universities in Nigeria. The [[National Universities Commission]] ([[NUC]]) is the major accreditation body that enforces uniform standard and sets admissions capacity of every university in Nigeria.
