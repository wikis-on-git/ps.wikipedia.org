'''جوليوس روبرټ اوپنهايمر'''{{#tag:ref |The meaning of the 'J' in J. Robert Oppenheimer has been a source of confusion. Historians Alice Kimball Smith and Charles Weiner sum up the general historical opinion in their volume ''Robert Oppenheimer: Letters and recollections'', on page 1: "Whether the 'J' in Robert's name stood for Julius or, as Robert himself once said, 'for nothing' may never be fully resolved. His brother Frank surmises that the 'J' was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a 'junior.'" It is not Jewish custom to name children after living relatives. In Peter Goodchild's ''J. Robert Oppenheimer: Shatterer of Worlds'', it is said that Robert's father, Julius, added the empty initial to give Robert's name additional distinction, but Goodchild's book has no footnotes so the source of this assertion is unclear. Robert's claim that the 'J' stood "for nothing" is taken from an autobiographical interview conducted by Thomas S. Kuhn on November 18, 1963, which currently resides in the Archive for the History of Quantum Physics. When investigating Oppenheimer in the 1930s and 1940s, the FBI itself was befuddled by the 'J', deciding that it probably stood for Julius or Jerome. On the other hand, Oppenheimer's birth certificate reads "Julius Robert Oppenheimer".|name="name" |group="note"}} (۲۲ د اپرېل،۱۹۰۴ ز. – ۱۸ د اپرېل، ۱۹۶۷ ز.) يو امريکايي فيزيکپوه او د کاليفورنيا د بېرکلي د پوهنتون د فيزيک پوهاند و. هغه د مانهاتان د پروژې د ساينسي ريس په توګه ښه پېژندل شوی. د مانهاتان پروژه د ۲ مې نړيوالې جګړې يوه پروژه وه چې لومړنۍ هستوي وسلې يې جوړې کړې او له همدې کبله هغه ته کله نا کله د اتومي بم د پلار په نامه اشاره شوې.<ref>{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=xi}}</ref> In reference to the [[Trinity test]] in New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb was detonated, Oppenheimer famously recalled the [[Bhagavad Gita]]: "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one... Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."{{#tag:ref |Oppenheimer spoke these words in the  television documentary ''[http://www.atomicarchive.com/Movies/Movie8.shtml The Decision to Drop the Bomb]'' (1965).<ref name="The Decision to Drop the Bomb"/> In the literature, the quote normally appears in the form ''shatterer'' of worlds, because this was the form in which it first appeared in print, in [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] on November 8, 1948.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time]] |date=November 8, 1948 |title=The Eternal Apprentice |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853367-8,00.html |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> It later appeared in Robert Jungk's ''Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists'' (1958),<ref name="Jungk, p. 201">{{harvnb|Jungk|1958|p=201}}</ref> which was based on an interview with Oppenheimer.<ref>{{harvnb|Hijiya|2000|pp=123-124}}</ref>|name="quote" |group="note"}}

After the war Oppenheimer was a chief advisor to the newly created [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and used that position to lobby for international control of [[nuclear power]] to avert [[nuclear proliferation]] and a [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken political opinions during the [[Second Red Scare]], he had his [[security clearance#United States|security clearance]] revoked in a much-publicized and politicized hearing in 1954. Though stripped of his direct political influence Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write and work in physics. A decade later President [[John F. Kennedy]] awarded (and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] presented) Oppenheimer with the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] as a gesture of [[political rehabilitation]].

Oppenheimer's notable achievements in physics include the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]] for molecular [[wavefunction]]s, work on the theory of [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s, the [[Oppenheimer–Phillips process]] in [[nuclear fusion]] and the first prediction of [[quantum tunneling]]. With his students he also made important contributions to the modern theory of [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, as well as the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]] and the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s. As a teacher and promoter of science, Oppenheimer is remembered as a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s. After World War II, he became the Senior Professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, a position previously held by [[Albert Einstein]].
