د '''خلکو جمهوري بنګله دېش''' په سوېلي آسيا کې يو هېواد دی چې د [[هندوستان]]، [[ماينامار(برما)|ماينامار]] او د [[بنګال خليج]] سره خپلې پولې لري. Together with the [[West Bengal]] state of India, it comprises the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. The name ''Bangladesh'' is written as বাংলাদেশ and pronounced {{IPA2|'baŋlad̪eʃ}}. It means "Country of Bengal"  but the origin of the word ''Bangla'' (Bengal) is obscure.

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د بنګله دېش تاريخ}}
Remnants of [[civilization]] in the greater [[Bengal]] region date back three millennia when the region was settled by [[Dravidian people|Dravidians]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burmans]]. It mostly fractured into unaffiliated units, ruled by various foreign and domestic kingdoms and empires. After the arrival of [[Indo-Aryans]], Bengal was ruled by Hindus [[Gupta Empire]] from the [[4th century|4th]] through [[6th century|6th]] centuries [[Common Era|CE]]. Then, a dynamic Bengali [[Shashanka]] erected an impressive but short-lived kingdom. With the 8th century [[Buddhist]] [[Pala dynasty]], the region reached its most ascendent moment, but retreated during the 12th century [[Sena dynasty]].

[[Islam]] was introduced to Bengal in the 12th century by [[Sufi]] missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests help spread Islam throughout the region. [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a Turkic general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal. The region was ruled by local rulers like [[Isa Khan]] and the fabled ''Baro Bhuiyans'' for the next few hundreds years. By the 16th century, the [[Mughal]] empire controlled Bengal and [[Dhaka]] became an important provincial center of Mughal administration as the seat of the [[Nawab]].

European traders arrived late in the 15th century and their influence grew till the [[British East India Company]] gained control of Bengal following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857 known as the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] resulted in transfer of authority to the  [[British Crown|crown]], with a British [[viceroy]] running the administration. A pattern of economic exploitation continued as famine racked the subcontinent many times, including at least two major famines in Bengal. Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, with [[Dhaka]] being the capital of the eastern zone.<ref name="johnsong">Johnson, G (1973). ''Partition, Agitation and Congress: Bengal 1904 to 1908'', Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 7, No. 3., pp. 533-588.</ref>

When the British left in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines, the [[West Bengal|western part]] going to India, while the eastern part joined [[Pakistan]] as a province called [[East Bengal (province)|East Bengal]], with its capital in [[Dhaka]]. In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal through the abolition of the feudal [[zamindari]] system.<ref name="ahmedi"> Ahmed, I and Timmons, J (1971). ''Current Land Reforms in East Pakistan'', Land Economics, Vol. 47, No. 1. pp. 55-64.</ref>
      
The upper levels of Pakistan's government and military were dominated by the feudal classes from the west, despite the economic and demographic weight of the east. The [[Language Movement]] of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan. In 1955, the province's name was changed to [[East Pakistan]] but tension with West Pakistan continued to rise. The Bengali [[Awami League]] agitated for autonomy, and in 1966, its president [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was jailed. 

[[دوتنه:TIMEfreedomofBangladesh.jpg|left|thumb|A ''[[TIME magazine|TIME]]'' magazine issue covering the newly independent Bangladesh.]]

In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated coastal East Pakistan, and the central government responded poorly. The anger was compounded when [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], whose [[Awami League]] fairly won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections<ref name="baxterc">Baxter, C. (1971). ''Pakistan Votes -- 1970'', Asian Survey, Vol. 11, No. 3, pp. 197-218.</ref>, was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President Yahya Khan arrested him and on [[March 25]],[[1971]] launched an all-out [[Operation Searchlight|military assault]] on East Pakistan. Yahya's methods were extremely bloody, as he intended to intimidate the Bengalis into total submission. His slaughter of unarmed innocents was one of the worst [[genocides]] in world history, similar in scale to that of [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]] [http://www.gendercide.org/case_bangladesh.html].  Chief targets included [[intellectual]]s and Hindus. Ten million [[refugee]]s fled to neighbouring India. Estimates of those massacred range from several hundred thousand to 3 million [http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm#Bangladesh],
[http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/history/holocaust.html], [http://www.negotiation.com/bangladeshi-independence.html].

The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for 9 months. The [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Mukti Bahini]] and Bengali regulars eventually received support from the [[Indian Armed Forces]] in December 1971. Under the command of [[Jagjit Singh Aurora|Lt. General J.S. Arora]], the [[Indian army]] achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan, taking over 90,000 prisoners of war<ref name="burkes">Burke, S. (1973). ''The Postwar Diplomacy of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971'', Asian Survey, Vol. 13, No. 11., pp. 1036-1049. </ref> in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. 

[[دوتنه:Map Bangladesh RoadRail.png|thumb|right|250px|Bangladesh - also showing Rail and Road links.]]

After independence, Bangladesh initially became a parliamentary democracy, with Mujib as the Prime Minister. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974. On [[January 25]], [[1975]], Mujib became President and initiated one party rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. All but four Government [[newspaper]]s were banned. On [[August 15]], [[1975]], Mujib and his family were assassinated by mid-level military officers. A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the following three months culminated in the ascent to power of General [[Ziaur Rahman]]. Under Zia, foreign relations improved, but at the same time, Zia removed [[secularism]] and [[socialism]] as the basic principles of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]], replacing them with "Complete Faith and Trust in Allah" and "Social justice". Zia founded [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) which won the 1978 election. However, amid declining popularity, he was assassinated in 1981 by elements of the military. Bangladesh's next major ruler was General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]] who gained power in a bloodless coup in 1982. He made [[Islam]] the state religion. He ruled from 1982 until 1990, when he was ousted in a popular uprising.

Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow [[Khaleda Zia]] rose to head the BNP and the country from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001. She maintains a bitter rivalry with one of Mujib's surviving daughter [[Sheikh Hasina]] who heads the Awami League and was in power from 1996 to 2001.

Inspite of widespread poverty and corruption, Bangladesh has remained a democracy. Bangladesh has instituted an unique system of transfer of power.  At the end of the tenure of the government, power is handed over to members of the [[Caretaker|civil society]] for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was adopted to the constitution in 1996.

{{National symbols of Bangladesh}}
[[دوتنه:Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (Roehl).jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]], designed by [[Louis I. Kahn]], houses the National Parliament of Bangladesh]]

Bangladesh is a [[parliamentary democracy]]. The [[President of Bangladesh|President]] is the [[head of state]], a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], who is [[head of government]]. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], mainly in controlling the transition to a new government.

The [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|prime minister]] is ceremonially appointed by the president and must be a member of parliament (MP) commanding the confidence of the majority of other MPs. The [[cabinet]] is composed of [[minister]]s selected by the prime minister and appointed by the president. The [[unicameral]] Bangladeshi [[parliament]] is the House of the Nation or [[Jatiyo Sangshad]], which has 300 members elected by popular vote from single territorial constituencies for five-year terms of office. There used to be 30 special seats are reserved for women, who were elected by the 300 regular members of the parliament. This transitory provision is no longer in place, and no new provision has been inacted. There is [[universal suffrage]], citizens attain the right to vote at age 18.

The most important legal document in Bangladesh is the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]]. The constitution<ref name="shongbidhan"> [http://www.pmo.gov.bd/constitution/index.htm Constitution of Bangladesh]</ref> was written in 1972 and has undergone thirteen [[amendment]]s [http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/C_0336.htm]. All other laws of the country are made by the Parliament conforming to the tenets of the constitution. The highest [[judiciary]] body is the Supreme Court, whose chief justices and other judges are appointed by the president. The judiciary is not separate from the administration, which has caused much commotion in recent years. Laws are loosely based on [[English common law]]. But family laws (regarding marriage, inheritance, etc.) are based on religious texts, and hence differ for various religious communities.

== سياست ==
{{main|List of political parties in Bangladesh}}
[[Khaleda Zia]] began her second (non-contiguous) 5-year term as Prime Minister in 2001. She is the head of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) which has formed a coalition with [[Jatiya Party]] and the two moderate Islamist parties [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and [[Islami Oikya Jot]]. The opposition is led by [[Sheikh Hasina]] and the [[Awami League]], which has been a key party since and prior to independence. Awami tends to adopt a more secular stance and tilts towards India, while BNP has closer relations with China. Awami-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. This has been partly attributed to the personal animosity that continues to exist between the main two female leaders.

Two radical Islamist parties, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB) and Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), were banned in February, 2005.  Since then, a series of bomb attacks have been blamed on those groups, and hundreds of their suspected members have been detained in numerous security operations. The first recorded case of a suicide bomb attack in Bangladesh took place in November 2005.

== جغرافيه ==
[[دوتنه:Bangladesh divisions english.png|thumb|250px|Map of Bangladesh showing the six administrative divisions]]
{{main|Divisions of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh is divided into six administrative divisions, all named after their respective divisional headquarters:
* [[Barisal division|Barisal]]  বরিশাল
* [[Chittagong division|Chittagong]]  চট্টগ্রাম
* [[Dhaka division|Dhaka]]  ঢাকা
* [[Khulna division|Khulna]]  খুলনা
* [[Rajshahi division|Rajshahi]]  রাজশাহী
* [[Sylhet division|Sylhet]]  সিেলট

The next level of administrative unit is a district or ''zila'' (িজলা) (in [[Bengali language|Bangla]]). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh. For more information, see [[Districts of Bangladesh]].

Each district is further subdivided into ''thana'' or Police stations (formerly called upa-zila or sub-districts). Each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions. The unions consist of many villages. In the metropolitan areas, the unit is a ward, which consists of several ''mahalla'' or areas. At the district level there is no elected officials, only the government appointed administration. Direct elections are held for each union, in both cases electing a chairperson and a number of members of comissioners. In 1997, a parliamentary amendment was passed to reserved 3 seats (out of 12) for female candidates in every union.<ref name="unionwomen">''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997. </ref>

[[Dhaka]] is the country's capital and largest city. Other major cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet]], and [[Khulna]].

{{main|د بنګله دېش جغرافيه}}
Bangladesh consists mostly of a low-lying [[river delta]] located on the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the geographic region called the [[Ganges Delta]] or Ganges-Brahmaputra River Delta. This densely populated delta is formed by the confluence of the [[Ganges]] (local name ''Padma'' or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra]] (''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna]] rivers and their tributaries as they flow down from the [[Himalaya]]. It is the largest river delta in the world. Bangladesh's [[alluvial soil]] is highly fertile but vulnerable to flood and [[drought]]. Hills rise above the plain only in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] (highest point: in the Mowdok range at 1,052&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (3,451&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), N&nbsp;21°47'12"&nbsp;E&nbsp;92°36'36", not [[Keokradong]], 883&nbsp;m (2,897&nbsp;ft) not 1,230&nbsp;m (4,035&nbsp;ft) as sometimes reported) in the far southeast and the [[Sylhet division]] in the northeast. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than 10 meters above sea level, and it is belived that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 meter.<ref name="alia">Ali, A (1996). ''Vulnerability of bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges'', Water, Air, & Soil Pollution. 92(1-2). pp 171-179.</ref>

A large part of the coastline consists of the  [[marsh]]y [[jungle]] known as the [[Sundarbans]]. Sundarbans, one of the largest [[mangrove]] [[forests]] in the world, is home to very diverse flora and fauna, including the (Royal) [[Bengal Tiger]]. This region is endangered and half the size it used to be 150 years ago with subtantial reduction in diversity as well.<ref name="sundwild">''Sundarban wildlife sanctuaries Bangladesh'', World Heritage Nomination-IUCN Technical Evaluation.</ref>

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the Bangladeshi climate is [[Tropics|tropical]] with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June, and a humid, warm rainy [[monsoon]] from June to October. Natural calamities, such as [[flood]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[tidal bore]]s affect the country almost every year, combined with the effects of [[deforestation]], [[soil degradation]] and [[erosion]]. [[Cox's Bazar]], south of the city of [[Chittagong]], has a sea beach that stretches uninterrupted over 120 kilometres (75&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]); it is frequently quoted as the World's longest natural sea beach (although this claim is difficult to prove or disprove).

{{main|د بنګله دېش اقتصاد}}
[[دوتنه:Cox's Bazaar Fishermen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fishermen near the town of Cox's Bazaar in southern Bangladesh. Many industries in Bangladesh are still primitive by modern standards.]]

Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains an underdeveloped, [[overpopulation|overpopulated]], and ill-governed nation. The par capita income in 2004 was a low 440$, and many other economic indicators were less than impressive [http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html]. Yet, as the [[World Bank]] notes in its July 2005 Country Brief, the country has made impressive progress in human development by focusing on increasing [[literacy]], achieving gender parity in schooling, and reducing population growth.

[[Jute]] was once Bangladesh's economic engine. Its share of the world export market peaked in the late 1940s at 80% [http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/J_0135.HTM] and even in the early 1970s accounted for 70% of its export earnings. But after [[polypropylene]] products began to substitute jute products in the world economy, Bangladesh's jute industry started to slow down.

Bangladesh also grows significant quantities of [[rice]], [[tea]] and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. Although two-thirds of Bangladeshis are farmers, nowadays more than three quarters of Bangadesh's export earnings come from the [[garment industry]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4118969.stm],
which began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s due to cheap labor and low conversion cost. In 2002, the industry exported $5 billion worth of products. <ref name="rahs">Rahman, Shahidur (2004). ''Global Shift: Bangladesh Garment Industry in Perspective'', Asian Affairs, 26(1), pp 75-91.</ref> The industry now employs more than 3 million workers, 90% of whom are women.<ref name="begn">Begum, N (2001). ''Enforcement of Safety Regulations in Garment sector in Bangladesh'', Growth of Garment Industry in Bangladesh: Economic and Social dimension. pp 208-226</ref> A significant amount of foreign currency earnings also come from the remittances sent by expatriate Bangladeshis living in other countries.

Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged [[port]] facilities, a growth in the labor force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as [[natural gas]]), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. According to the World Bank's Country Brief updated July, 2005: "Among Bangladesh’s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions." 
[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/BANGLADESHEXTN/0,,menuPK:295769~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295760,00.html]

In spite of the hurdles, since 1990 the country has achieved an average annual growth rate of 5% according to the World Bank. The [[middle class]] and the [[consumer]] industry have seen some growth. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging "BRIC" economies ([[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], and [[China]]), [[Goldman Sachs]] named Bangladesh one of the "Next Eleven,"<ref name="nextele"> [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000177&sid=aoJ4WG5LSf1s&refer=market_insight South Korea, Another `BRIC' in Global Wall]</ref> along with [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], Pakistan, the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]] and [[Vietnam]]. Bangladesh has seen a sharp increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. A number of multinational corporations, including [[Unocal]] and [[Tata]], have made significant investments, with the [[natural gas]] sector a priority. In December 2005, the Central Bank of Bangladesh projected GDP growth between 6.3% to 6.8%.

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[Microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus]] through the [[Grameen Bank]]. Already in late 1990's Grameen Bank had 2.3 million members, with a further 2.5 million members of other similar organizations.<ref name="schm">Schreiner1, Mark (2003). ''A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh'', Development Policy Review, 21(3), pp 357-382</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Bangladesh}}

Bangladesh has a population of 144 million (July 2005 est.) making it the 7th most populous country in the world. Bangladesh is the one of the [[List of countries by population density|most densely populated countries in the world]] at about 1,000 persons per square kilometre (2,585/sq.&nbsp;mi). In the mid-1980's, the government promoted [[birth control]], which helped to reduce the population growth rate to about 2%. However, Most of the people are relatively young, (the 0-25 age group represents 60 percent of the total population and only 3 percent being 65 or older). Life expectancy rate is 61 years.

Bangladesh is ethnically homogeneous, with Bengalis comprising 98% of the population. The remainder are mostly [[Bihari]] migrants and indegenous tribal groups.  There are 13 tribal groups located in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], the most populous of the tribes are the [[Chakma]]s. The region has been a source for ethnic tension since the inception of Bangladesh.<ref name="rashm"> Rashiduzzaman, M (1998). ''Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord: Institutional Features and Strategic Concerns''. Asian Survey, 38(7), pp. 653-670.</ref> The largest tribal groups outside the Hill Tracts are the [[Santal|Santhals]] and the [[Garo (tribe)|Garos (Achiks)]].

The main language, as in [[West Bengal]], is [[Bangla]] (Bengali), an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] of [[Sanskrit]] origin (like [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi]], and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and others). The language is written in its own [[Bengali script]]. Bangla is the official language of Bangladesh, but [[English language|English]] is widely spoken as a second language among the middle and upper classes, and is often used in official tasks and higher education.

The two major religions practiced in Bangladesh are [[Islam]] (83% [[CIA]] est. 1998, 88% US State Department est. 2005) and [[Hinduism]] (16% CIA est. 1998, 11% US State Dept. 2005). The ethnic Biharis are predominantly [[Shia]] Muslims. There are also some [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhists]], [[Christianity|Christians]], and [[animism|Animists]].

Health and education levels have improved steadily, poverty levels have gone down. Nevertheless, Bangladesh remains among the poorest nations in the world. Most Bangladeshis are rural and poor, living on subsistence farming. Nearly half of the population lives on less than 1 USD per day [http://www.usaid.gov/policy/budget/cbj2005/ane/bd.html]. Health problems abound, ranging from [[surface water]] contamination, to [[arsenic]] in the [[ground water]],<ref name="arsenic">Nickson, R. McArthur, J. Burgess, W. Ahmed, K. M. Ravenscroft, P. Rahman, M. (1998). ''Arsenic poisoning of Bangladesh groundwater'', Nature, Issue 6700, p. 338</ref> and diseases including [[malaria]], [[leptospirosis]] and [[dengue]]. Literacy rates are 54% among men and 32% among women.

{{main|د بنګله دېش کلتور/فرهنگ}}
Bangladesh has a vibrant culture that encompasses traditions both old and new. The [[Bangla language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, mostly shared by Bangladesh and [[West Bengal]]. The first literary text in Bangla is the seventh century [[Charyapada]]. The medieval ages saw much activity in Bangla literature by poets like [[Alaol]] and [[Chandidas]]. Bangla literature matured in the nineteenth century. The greatest literary icons are [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Rabindranath wrote what was later adopted as Bangladesh's national anthem [[Amar Shonar Bangla]], whereas a song of Nazrul was adopted as the Martial song. Contemporary Bangladesh keeps producing a substantial amount of litearture of all forms. Bangladesh also has a rich tradition in folk literature, evidenced by ''Môemonshingha gitika'', ''Ţhakurmar Jhuli'' or stories related to ''Gopal Bhar'' and ''[[Birbal]]''.

The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music, and [[Lalon Fakir]] perhaps the best-known of Bauls. There are numorous other musical traditions in Bangladesh, and vary from one region to the other. [[Gombhira|Gambhira]], Bhatiali, Bhawaiya are some well known musical forms. Folk music of Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara|êktara]], a string instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol|đhol]], [[khanjan]], and [[tabla]], among others. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Indian classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Perhaps the most famous classical musician from Bangladesh is [[Allauddin Khan|Ustad Allauddin Khan]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms also draw from folk traditons, specially those of the various tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition. Bangladesh produces about 60 films a year. However Bangladeshis are avid consumers of [[Bollywood]]-made cinema, as well as films from [[Kolkata]], in West Bengal, which has its own thriving Bengali-language movie industry.

The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relation to Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine as well as having many distinctive traits. Rice and fish are traditional favorites, so much so that a common saying goes "Rice and fish make a Bengali" (machhe bhate bangali). Meat is becoming more common due to increased production in recent times.

{{main|Education in Bangladesh}}

The literacy rate in Bangladesh is approximately 41% [http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/countries.cfm?c=BGD]. Education in Bangladesh is highly subsidized by the Government, which operates many [[school]]s and colleges at the [[primary school|primary]], [[secondary school|secondary]] and higher secondary level as well as many public [[university|universities]]. To increase the literacy level, many innovative programs have been introduced in the country. Among the most sucessful ones are Food for education (FFE) program introduced in 1993.<ref name="ahma">Ahmed, A and del Nino, C (2002).''The food for education program in Bangladesh: An evaluation of its impact on educational attainment and food security'', FCND DP No. 138, International Food Policy Research Institute</ref> The Government also greatly subsidises the salaries of teachers in non-government schools. To promote literacy among women, a stipend program for women till the higher secondary level was instituted in 1994. A government-funded program gives incentives like [[stipend]]s and food for continuing education in the secondary level. Administratively, the country is divided into seven education boards (Barishal, Chittagong, Comilla, Dhaka, Jessore, Rajshahi and Sylhet Education Boards) which oversee education from the primary to the higher secondary level, and conduct the primary and junior scholarship examinations, the [[SSC|Secondary School Certificate]] examination, and the [[HSC|Higher Secondary Certificate]] examination. 

[[Higher education]] is also subsidized by the government, and most of the students seeking college education are enrolled in a public instituition. [[Dhaka University]] is the largest and oldest of all the public universities in Bangladesh. The National University regulates all public colleges in the country, hence an undergraduate student at a public college receives a degree from the National University. [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]] (BUET), located in Dhaka, is the foremost instituition for technology in the country. There are newer universities in Chittagong, Khulna, Gazipur, Rajshahi and Sylhet that also provide engineering education. Public education in medical sciences is provided by Medical Colleges, each regulated by a public university. Postgraduate education in medical sciences is provided by BSMM University in Dhaka. [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] in [[Mymensingh]] is the premier institution for agricultural studies, though other institutes exists as well. There are also a number of polytechnic institutes providing diplomas in specific technologies. Bangladesh also has a [[leather]] institute, a textile institute and other specialized education centers. Since the 1990's, higher education has boomed with the introduction of private universities. There are many private universities providing general, engineering and medical education.

Notable reseach institutions include [[BRRI|Bangladesh Rice Research Institute]] and [http://www.icddrb.org/ International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research].
