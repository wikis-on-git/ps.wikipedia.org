The '''Kingdom of Spain''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Galician]]: ''Reino de España''; [[Catalan]]: ''Regne d'Espanya''; [[Basque]]: ''Espainiako Erresuma''; [[Occitan]]: ''Regne d'Espanha'') is the largest of the three sovereign states that make up the Iberian peninsula—the others are [[Portugal]] and [[Andorra]]—located in southwestern Europe. To the west (and, in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], south), it borders [[پرتګال]]. To the south, it borders [[Gibraltar]] and, through its cities in North Africa ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]), [[ماراکو]]. To the northeast, along the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, it borders [[فرانسه]] and the tiny [[principality]] of [[Andorra]]. It also includes the [[Balearic Islands]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Canary Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the [[strait of Gibraltar]], known as ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]'', such as the [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarine]] islands, the "rocks" (''peñones'') of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez]] and [[Peñón de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]], and the tiny [[Isla Perejil]] ([[Disputed territories|disputed]]). In the Northeast along the [[Pyrenees]], a small [[exclave]] town called [[Llívia]] in [[Catalonia]] is surrounded by [[France|French]] territory.

{{main|Politics of Spain}}
Spain is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with a hereditary [[monarch]] and a bicameral [[parliament]], the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' or National Assembly. The [[executive branch]] consists of a Council of Ministers presided over by the President of Government (comparable to a [[prime minister]]), proposed by the monarch and elected by the National Assembly following legislative elections.

The [[legislative branch]] is made up of the Congress of Deputies (''Congreso de los Diputados'') with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and a [[Senate]] or ''Senado'' with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.

Spain is, at present, what is called a ''[[State]] of Autonomies'', formally unitary but, in fact, functioning as a [[Federation]] of [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]], each one with different powers (for instance, some have their own educational and health systems, others do not) and laws. There are some differences within this system, since power has been devolved from the centre to the periphery asymmetrically, with some autonomous governments (especially those dominated by nationalist parties) seeking a more federalist—or even [[confederation|confederate]]—kind of relationship with Spain, now the Central Government is dealing with autonomous governments for the transfer of more autonomy. This novel system of asymmetrical [[devolution]] has been described as a [[coconstitutionalism]] and has similarities to the devolution process adopted by the [[United Kingdom]] since 1997.

The terrorist group, [[ETA]] (Basque Homeland and Freedom), is attempting to achieve Basque independence through [[violence|violent]] means, including bombings and killings of politicians, police and militaries. They consider themselves a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] organization. Although the Basque Autonomous government does not condone any kind of violence, their different approaches to the separatist movement are a source of tension between the federal and Basque governments.

On [[17 May]] [[2005]], all the parties in the Congress of Deputies, except the PP, passed the Central Government's motion of beginning peace talks with the ETA with no political concessions and only if it gives up all its weapons. PSOE, CiU, ERC, PNV, IU-ICV, CC and the mixed group -BNG, CHA, EA y NB- supported it with a total of 192 votes, while the 147 PP parliamentaris objected.

On February 20th 2005, Spain became the first country to allow its people to vote on the European Union constitution that was signed in October 2004. The rules state that if any country rejects the constitution then the constitution will be declared void. Despite a very low participation (42%), the final result was very strongly in affirmation of the constitution, making Spain the first country to approve the constitution via [[referendum]] ([[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Slovenia]] approved it before Spain, but they did not hold referenda).

On July 3rd 2005, Spain became the third country in the world to allow [[same-sex marriages]] (see [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] for more information about this).

=== جغرافيه ===
{{main articles|[[Provinces of Spain]] and [[Comarcas of Spain]]}}

The Spanish kingdom has also a provincial structure. Spain is divided into 50 [[provinces]] (''provincias''). This structure is prior to that of the autonomous communities (dates back to 1833). Therefore, autonomous communities group provinces (for instance, [[Extremadura]] is made of two provinces: [[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres]] and [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]]). The autonomous communities of [[Asturias]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Cantabria]], [[La Rioja]], [[Navarre]], [[Murcia]], and [[Madrid]] (the nation's [[Capital city|capital]]) are each composed of a single province. Traditionally, provinces are usually subdivided into historic regions or ''comarcas''.

=== Places of sovereignty ===
There are also five enclaves (''[[plaza de soberanía|plazas de soberanía]]'') on and off the [[Africa]]n coast: the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] are administered as autonomous cities, an intermediate status between cities and communities; the islands of the [[Islas Chafarinas]], [[Penon de Alhucemas|Peñón de Alhucemas]], and [[Penon de Velez de la Gomera|Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]] are under direct Spanish administration.

The [[Canary islands]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], although not officially historic communities, enjoy a special status.

== جغرافيه ==
[[دوتنه:spain.png|right|thumb|330px|Map of mainland Spain]]
{{main|Geography of Spain}}
Mainland Spain is dominated by high plateaus and mountain ranges such as the [[Pyrenees]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]. Running from these heights are several major rivers such as the [[Tajo]], the [[Ebro]], the [[Duero]], the [[Guadiana]] and the [[Guadalquivir]]. Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in [[Andalusia]], in the east there are alluvial plains with medium rivers like [[Segura]], [[Júcar]] and [[Turia]]. Spain is bound to the east by [[Mediterranean Sea]] (containing the [[Balearic Islands]]), to the north by the [[Bay of Biscay]] and to its west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where the [[Canary Islands]] off the [[Africa]]n coast are found.

Spain's [[climate]] can be divided in four areas:

* The Mediterranean: mostly temperate in the eastern and southern part of the country; rainy seasons are spring and autumn. Mild summers with pleasant temperatures. ''Hot records'': Murcia 47.2&nbsp;°C, Malaga 44.2&nbsp;°C, Valencia 42.5&nbsp;°C, Alicante 41.4&nbsp;°C, Palma of Mallorca 40.6&nbsp;°C, Barcelona 39.8&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Gerona -13.0&nbsp;°C, Barcelona -10.0&nbsp;°C, Valencia -7.2&nbsp;°C, Murcia -6.0&nbsp;°C, Alicante -4.6&nbsp;°C, Malaga -3.8&nbsp;°C.

* The interior: Very cold winters (frequent snow in the north) and hot summers. ''Hot records'': Sevilla 47.0&nbsp;°C, Cordoba 46.6&nbsp;°C, Badajoz 45.0&nbsp;°C, Albacete and Zaragoza 42.6&nbsp;°C, Madrid 42.2&nbsp;°C, Burgos 41.8&nbsp;°C, Valladolid 40.2&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Albacete -24.0&nbsp;&nbsp;°C, Burgos -22.0&nbsp;°C, Salamanca -20.0&nbsp;°C, Teruel -19.0&nbsp;°C, Madrid -14.8&nbsp;°C, Sevilla -5.5&nbsp;°C.

* Northern Atlantic coast: precipitations mostly in winter, with mild summers (slightly cold). ''Hot records'': Bilbao 42.0&nbsp;°C, La Coruña 37.6&nbsp;°C, Gijón 36.4&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Bilbao -8.6&nbsp;°C, Oviedo -6.0&nbsp;°C, Gijon and La Coruña -4.8&nbsp;°C.

* The Canary Islands: subtropical weather, with mild temperatures (18&nbsp;°C to 24&nbsp;°C [[Celsius]]) throughout the year. ''Hot records'': Santa Cruz de Tenerife 42.6&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Santa Cruz de Tenerife 8.1&nbsp;°C.

=== Territorial disputes ===
==== Territories claimed by Spain ====
Spain has called for the return of [[Gibraltar]], a tiny [[United Kingdom|British]] possession on its southern coast. It was conquered during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1704 and was ceded to Britain in perpetuity in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. An overwhelming majority of Gibraltar's 30,000 inhabitants want to remain British, as they have repeatedly proven in referenda on the issue. The UN resolutions (2231 (XXI) and 2353 (XXII)) call on the UK and Spain to reach an agreement to end the colonial status of Gibraltar. According to Spain, these resolutions overule the Treaty of Utrecht. There is also dispute regarding the demarcation line. Britain extended its control up to the 18th century picket line in 1939 after General Franco's victory made it seem likely that Spain would enter the Second World War on the Axis side. Gibraltar is officially a non-self governing territory or colony according to the UN.

==== Spanish territories claimed by other countries ====
[[Morocco]] claims the Spanish cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the uninhabited [[Penon de Velez de la Gomera|Vélez]], [[Penon de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]], [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarinas]], and [[Isla Perejil|Perejil]] islands, all on the Northern coast of [[Africa]]. Morocco points out that those territories were obtained when Morocco could not do anything to prevent it and has never signed treaties ceding them. Spain claims that these territories are integral parts of Spain and have been Spanish or linked to Spain since before the Islamic invasion of Spain in 711 and returned to Spanish rule only a few years after the conquest of Granada. Spain claims that Morocco's only claim on these territories is geographical. Parallelism with Egyptian ownership of the Sinai (in Asia) or Turkish ownership of Istambul (in Europe) is often used to support the Spanish position.

[[Portugal]] does not recognize Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]]. The Portuguese claim that the Treaty of Vienna (1815), to which Spain was a signatory, stipulated return of the territory to Portugal. Spain alleges that the Treaty of Vienna left the provisions of the Treaty of Badajoz intact.

[[دوتنه:2e es.png|thumb|right|120px|King Juan Carlos, depicted on the Spanish €2 coin]]
{{main|Economy of Spain}}
Spain's mixed economy supports a GDP that on a per capita basis is 87% that of the four leading [[Western Europe|West European]] economies. The centre-right government of former Prime Minister [[Aznar]] worked to gain admission to the first group of countries launching the European single [[currency]], the [[euro]], on [[1 January]] [[1999]]. The Aznar administration continued to advocate liberalization, privatisation, and deregulation of the economy and introduced some [[tax]] reforms to that end. [[Unemployment]] fell steadily under the Aznar and Zapatero administration. It now is 8.7% (December 2005). This (still unacceptable) level must be seen in the light of levels of over 20% at the start of the 1990s. Growth of 2.4% in 2003 was satisfactory given the background of a faltering European economy, and has steadied since at an annualized rate of about 3.3% in mid 2005. The Prime Minister [[Rodríguez Zapatero]], whose party won the election three days after the [[Madrid]] train bombings in March 2004, plans to reduce government intervention in business, combat tax fraud, and support innovation, research and development, but also intends to reintroduce labour market regulations that had been scrapped by the Aznar government. Adjusting to the monetary and other economic policies of an integrated Europe - and reducing unemployment - will pose challenges to Spain over the next few years. According to [http://www.worldbank.org/data/databytopic/GDP.pdf World Bank GDP figures]from 2004, Spain has the 8th largest economy in the world.

There is general concern that Spain's model of economic growth (based largely on mass tourism, the construction industry, and manufacturing sectors) is faltering and may prove unsustainable over the long term. The first report of the Observatory on Sustainability (''Observatorio de Sostenibilidad'') - published in 2005 and funded by Spain's Ministry of the Environment and Alcalá University - reveals that the country's per capita GDP grew by 25% over the last ten years, while greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 45% since 1990. Although Spain's population grew by less than 5% between 1990 and 2000, urban areas expanded by no less than 25% over the same period. Meanwhile, Spain's energy consumption has doubled over the last 20 years and is currently rising by 6% per annum. This is particularly worrying for a country whose dependence on imported oil (meeting roughly 80% of Spain's energy needs) is one of the greatest in the EU. Large-scale unsustainable development is clearly visible along Spain's Mediterranean coast in the form of housing and tourist complexes, which are placing severe strain on local land and water resources. Other perennial weak points of Spain's economy include one of the lowest rates of investment in Research and Development, and in education in the EU. This is particularly worrying, given that the country's generally poorly-trained workforce is no longer as competitive in price terms as it was several decades ago. As a result, many manufacturing jobs are going abroad - mainly to Eastern Europe and Asia.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Spain}}
The Spanish Constitution, although affirming the sovereignty of the Spanish Nation, recognizes historical nationalities.

The Castilian-derived '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]''' (called both ''español'' and ''castellano'' in the language itself) is the official language throughout Spain, but other [[regional language]]s are also spoken. Without mentioning them by name, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]] recognizes the possibility of regional languages being co-official in their respective autonomous communities. The following languages are co-official with Spanish according to the appropriate [[Autonomy Statute (Spain)|Autonomy Statutes]].

* '''[[Catalan language|Catalan]]''' (''català'') in [[Catalonia]] (''Catalunya''), the [[Balearic Islands]] (''Illes Balears''), [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (''València''), [[Aragon]]'s eastern strip (''Aragó''), Alguer (Sardinia), Rosellón (France).
* '''[[Basque language|Basque]]''' (''euskara'') in [[Basque Country]] (''Euskadi''), and parts of [[Navarre]] (Nafarroa). Basque is not known to be related to any other language.
* '''[[Galician language|Galician]]''' (''galego'') in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (''Galicia'' or ''Galiza'').
* '''[[Occitan language|Occitan]]''' (the [[Aranese]] dialect). Spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia.

Catalan, Galician, Aranese (Occitan) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Castilian) are all descended from [[Latin]] and have their own dialects, some championed as separate languages by their speakers (the [[Valencià]] of [[València]], a dialect of Catalan, is one example).


There are also some other surviving [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[minority language]]s: [[Asturian language|Asturian / Leonese]], in [[Asturias]] and parts of [[León (province)|Leon]], [[Zamora]] and [[Salamanca]], and the [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]] in [[Caceres]] and [[Salamanca]], both descendants of the historical Astur-Leonese dialect; the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] or ''fabla'' in part of [[Aragon]]; the ''fala'', spoken in three villages of Extremadura; and some Portuguese dialectal towns in Extremadura and Castile-Leon. However, unlike Catalan, Galician, and Basque, these do not have any official status.

In the touristic areas of the Mediterranean ''[[costa]]s'' and the islands, German and English are spoken by tourists, foreign residents and tourism workers.

According to the Spanish government there are 3.7 million legal foreign residents in Spain. Of these around 500 000 are Morrocan and another half a million are Ecuatorian. More than 300 000 are Romanian and 270 000 are Colombian. There are also important numbers of British and German citizens. In 2005 alone, the immigrant population of Spain increased by 700 000 people. Spain has the highest immigration rate of the European Union. [http://about.reuters.com/dynamic/countrypages/argentina/1137502080nL17757149.ASP]

Many linguists claim that most of the Spanish language variants spoken in [[Latin America]] (Mexican, Argentinian, Colombian, Peruvian, etc. variants) descended from the Spanish spoken in south-western Spain ([[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]] and Canary Islands).

== Identities ==
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], in its second article, recognizes historic entities ("nationalities," a carefully chosen word in order to avoid "nations") and regions, inside the unity of the Spanish nation.

But Spain's identity is sometimes, in fact, an overlap of different regional identities, some of them even conflicting.

Castile is considered by many to be the "core" of Spain. However, this may just be a reflection of the fact that the Castilian national identity was the first one to be quashed by the Spanish Empire in the revolt of the Communards (''[[comuneros]]'') in 1518-1520.

The opposite is the case of a large part of [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Basque people|Basques]] and, in some measure, [[Galician people|Galicians]], who quite frequently identify, respectively, primarily with [[Catalonia]], the [[Basque Country]], and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] first, with Spain only second, or even third after Europe. For example, according to the last CIS survey, 44% of Basques identify themselves first as Basques (only 8% first as Spaniards); 40% of Catalans do so with their autonomous community (20% identify firstly with Spain), and 32% Galicians with Galicia (9% with Spain). Other regional groups, such as the [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]] have strong, but not as strong identities.  Almost all communities have a majority of people identifying as much with Spain as with the Autonomous Community (except Madrid, where Spain is the primary identity, and Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia, and the Balearics, where people tend to identify more with their Autonomous Community). Even Castille-Leon has 57% of people regarding themselves as much Spaniards as they are Castilians.

The situation is even more confusing, since there are regions with ambiguous identities, like [[Navarre]], [[Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], etc. There has been a lot of internal migration ([[rural exodus]]) from regions like Galicia, Andalusia and Extremadura to Madrid, Catalonia, Basque Country and the islands.

Spain became a unified crown with the union of [[Castile]] and [[Aragon]] and the conquest of Granada in 1492, and the annexation of [[Navarre]] in 1515. Until 1714, Spain was a loose confederation of kingdoms and statelets under one king, until King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] (Felipe V) removed the autonomous status of the Aragonese crown. Navarre and the Basque Provinces, however, kept a high degree of autonomy within their legal and financial system ([[Fueros]]). Moreover, the creation of a unified state in the 19th and 20th centuries has led to the present situation, which is apparently simple, but sometimes extremely confusing. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1936), Catalonia, the Basque country and Galicia were given limited self-government, which was lost after the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) and restored in 1978 during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]].

=== Minority groups ===
Since the 16th century, the most important minority group in the country have been the [[Gitanos]], a [[Roma in Spain|Roma group]]. Other historical minorities are [[Merchero]]s (or [[Quinqui]]s) and [[Vaqueiros de alzada]]. The latter, meaning "mountain  cattle ranchers" dwell in mountain ranges in the Principality of Asturias and have kept historically apart from the valley dwellers.

The number of [[immigrant]]s or foreign residents has tripled to 3,691,547 in less than five years, according the latest figures (2005) of National Statics Institute. They currently make up around 8.5 % of the official total population. The rise of population in Spain in recent years was largely due to them. Nearly half of all immigrants have neither residence nor work permits.

As of October 2005, and according to the official Ministry of Labour data [http://extranjeros.mtas.es/en/general/ObservatorioPermanente_index.html Permanent Immigration Observatory], there are 2,597,014 foreigners with valid residence permits, of which the largest are 552,694 EU citizens, also with 144,283 Britons, 473,048 Moroccans, 333,251 Ecuadorians, 192,965 Colombians and 174,590 Romanians.

A sizeable and increasing number of Spanish citizens (as Spain applies ''[[ius soli]]'' and provides special measures for immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries in order to acquire the citizenship) also descend from these communities.

[[دوتنه:1928SpanishStamppeseta-pio11-alfonso13.jpg|thumb|right|240px|1928 Spanish one-peseta postage stamp pairs [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]]]]
{{seealso|Religion in Spain}}
[[Roman Catholic]]ism is, by far, the most popular religion in the country. According to several sources (CIA World Fact Book 2005, Spanish official polls and others), from 80% to 94% self-identify as Catholics, whereas around 6% to 13% identify with either other religions or none at all. Spain is also the location of one of the Roman Catholic church's most important [[List of holy cities|holy cities]]; [[Santo Toribio de Liébana]], which holds the largest single piece of the [[true cross]]. It is important to note, however, that many Spaniards identify themselves as Catholics just because they were baptised, even though they are not very religious at all (in fact some polls show that 14% do not believe in any God). According to recent surveys (New York Times, April 19, 2005) only around 18 % of Spaniards regularly attend mass. Of those under 30, only about 14 % attend.

Further evidence of the secular nature of modern Spain can be seen in the widespread support for the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] - over 70% of Spaniards support gay marriage according to a 2004 study by the [http://www.cis.es/ Centre of Sociological Investigations]. Indeed, in June 2005 a bill was passed by 187 votes to 147 to allow gay marriage, making Spain the third country in the European Union to allow same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones. This vote was split along conservative-liberal lines, with PSOE and other left-leaning parties supporting the measure and PP against it. Proposed changes to the divorce laws to make the process quicker and to eliminate the need for a guilty party are also popular. In truth, there is a growing rift between the urban areas of Spain and parts of the periphery, such as Catalonia, who support the secularisation of the state, and the rural areas and conservative parts of the periphery, like Galicia, who support keeping the social ideals inherent with their religious past.

According to membership [http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_jw.html], the second religion of Spain is the organization of the [[Jehovah's Witness]]es with 103,784 active publishers; there are also many Protestant denominations, all of them with less than 50&nbsp;000 members, and about 20,000 [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|Mormons]]. [[Evangelism]] has been better received among [[Roma people|Gypsies]] than among the general population; pastors have integrated [[flamenco]] music in their liturgy. Taken together, all self-described "Evangelicals" slightly surpass Jehovah's Witnesses in number. Other religious faiths represented in Spain include the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] Community.

The recent waves of immigration have led to an increasing number of [[Muslim]]s, who have about 800,000 members. Muslims either converted in 1492 or given the option to leave. By the 16th century most of them had left the Spanish kingdom. 

Since the expulsion of the [[Sephardi]]m in 1492, [[Judaism]] was practically nonexistent until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 14,000 Jews in Spain, all arrivals in the past century. There are also many Spaniards (in Spain and abroad) who claim Jewish ancestry to the [[Conversos]], and still practice certain customs. Spain is believed to have been about 8 % [[Judaism|Jewish]] on the eve of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. {{see|History of the Jews in Spain}}

Over the past thirty years, Spain has become a more secularised society. The number of believers has decreased significantly and for those who believe the degree of accordance and practice to their church is diverse.

According to the latest official poll [http://www.cis.es/Catalogo/Estudio.aspx?year=&barometro=&ultimosestudios=&tema=119&estudio=2170&cuestionario=2190&muestra=5485 (CIS, 2002)], 80% of Spaniards self-identify as [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], 12% as ''non-believer'', and 1% as ''other'' (the remaining 7% declined to state). Of the 1.4% identifying as ''other'', 29% identified as [[Evangelical Christian]], 26% as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and 3.5% as Muslim (the rest either mentioned smaller religions or declined to state). According to the same poll, 73% believe in God, 14% don't and 12% are unsure (1% declined to state). Additionally, according to this poll, only 41% believe in [[Heaven]]. 24% of the Spaniards think that the [[Bible]] is just a fable. Only 25% of [[Catholics]] go to church at least once a week.
