A '''movie theater''' ([[North America]]), also known as '''cinema''' ([[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], as well as North America), a '''movie house''', or the '''pictures''', is a venue, usually a building, for viewing [[film|movie]]s.  Most cinemas are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend  by purchasing a [[ticket]]. The film is projected with a [[movie projector]] onto a large [[projection screen]] at the front of the [[auditorium]].  Some movie theaters are now equipped for [[Digital cinema#Digital projection|digital cinema projection]], removing the need to create and transport a physical [[Filmstock#Intermediate and print stocks|film print]].

==Spelling and alternative terms==

Outside of North America most English speaking countries use the term cinema, while "theatre" usually refers to live-performance venues. In the [[United States]], the customary spelling is "theater", but the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] uses the spelling "theatre" to refer to cinemas. 

Colloquial expressions, mostly used for cinemas collectively, include ''the silver screen'', ''the big screen'' (contrasted with the "small screen" of [[television]]) and (in England) ''the pics'', ''the flicks'', and ''the flea pit'', which derives from the long standing belief that the seats were infested with fleas as they were so uncomfortable to sit on, resulting in frequent fidgeting. 

A "screening room" usually refers to a small facility for viewing movies, often for the use of those involved in the production of motion pictures, or in large private residences.

==تاريخ==
[[Image:HoustonRiverOaksTheater.JPG|thumb|right|Many older movie theaters, such as the [[River Oaks Theatre]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], have been restored and play [[arthouse]] movies; newer multiplexes in the areas with restored theaters show first run films.]]
=== د 1900 کال نه مخکې ===
Noting that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was at [[Koster & Bials Music Hall]] on 34th Street in New York City on April 23, 1896, the first theater in the US dedicated exclusively to showing motion pictures was Vitascope Hall, established on [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] June 26, 1896.  In the basement of the new [[Ellicott Square Building]], Main Street, [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Mitchell Mark]] added what they called [[Edison]]’s [[Vitascope Theater]], which they opened to the general public on Monday, 19 October 1896, in collaboration with Rudolph Wagner, who had moved to Buffalo after spending several years working at the Edison laboratories. Terry Ramsaye, in his book, A Million and One Nights [p. 276], notes that this “was one of the earliest permanently located and exclusively motion-picture exhibitions.” According to the Buffalo News (Wednesday, 2 November 1932), “There were seats for about 90 persons and the admission was three cents. Feeble, flickering films of travel scenes were the usual fare." 
=== 1900-1919  ===
The first permanent structure designed for screening of movies was [[Tally's Electric Theater]], completed in [[1902]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The [[1913]] opening of the Regent Theater in [[New York City]] signalled a new respectability for the medium, and the start of the two-decade heyday of American cinema design. The ornate [[Al Ringling Theater]] was the very first "Movie Palace" it was built in Baraboo, WI by Al Ringling, one of the founders of the Ringling Bros. Circus for the then incredible sum of $100,000.00.  Later, Los Angeles promoter [[Sid Grauman]] continued the trend of theatre-as-destination with his ornate "[[Million Dollar Theatre]]", using the same design firm as Ringling (the MDT was the first to signify its primary use for motion pictures with the "theatre" spelling), and opened on Broadway in [[downtown Los Angeles]] in [[1918]].

=== د 1920 نه تر 1980 ===
In the next ten years, as movie revenues exploded, independent promoters and movie studios (who owned their own proprietary chains until an [[antitrust]] ruling in 1948) raced to build the most lavish, elaborate, attractive theatres.  These forms morphed into a unique architectural genre&mdash;the '''[[movie palace]]'''&mdash;a unique and extreme architectural genre which came to an end with the deepening of the [[Great Depression]].  The movie chains were also among the first industries to install [[air conditioning]] systems which gave the theatres an additional lure of comfort in the summer period.

Several [[movie studio]]s achieved [[vertical integration]] by acquiring and constructing theatre chains. The so-called "Big Five" theatre chains of the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] were all owned by studios: [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner]], [[Loews Theatres|Loews]] (owned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[Twentieth Century Fox|Fox]], and [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. All were broken up as a result of the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in the [[1948]] ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[anti-trust]] case.

In the [[1970]]s, [[adult theater|porn theatres]] started to have rampant ubiquity in some areas.  However, the introduction of the low-cost [[VHS]] video system for home televisions has decommissioned many porno cinemas as well as many 'second-run' theatres.

=== د 1980 نه وروسته ===

People can pay to watch movies at home, through [[cable television]] or {{ml|Internet|Streaming_media|streamed from the internet}}: [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and [[video on demand]] (VOD). This may decommission even more movie theatres.

==Design==
[[Image:MovieTheatre_gobeirne.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Interior of a [[Hoyts]] movie theater in [[Australia]], complete with [[Architectural acoustics|acoustic]] [[curtain|wall hangings]], wall-mounted [[loudspeaker|speakers]], and [[cup holder]]s.]]
Traditionally a movie theater, like a stage [[theater]], consists of a single auditorium with rows of comfortable seats, as well as a [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] area containing a [[box office]] for buying [[ticket]]s, a counter and/or selfservice facilities for buying snacks and drinks, and [[washroom]]s.  Stage theaters are sometimes converted into movie theatres by placing a screen in front of the stage and adding a [[movie projector|projector]]; this conversion may be permanent, or temporary for purposes such as showing [[arthouse]] fare to an audience accustomed to plays. The familiar characteristics of relatively low admission and open seating can be traced to [[Samuel Roxy Rothafel]], an early movie theater [[impresario]]. Many of these early theatres contain a [[balcony]], an elevated platform above the theater's rearmost seats. The rearward main floor "loge" seats were sometimes larger, softer, and more widely spaced and sold for a higher price.

In conventional low pitch viewing floors the preferred seating arrangement is to use staggered rows. While a less efficient use of floor space this allows a somewhat improved sight line between the patrons seated in the next row toward the screen, provided they do not lean toward one another.

"[[Stadium seating]]" is employed in many modern theaters, giving patrons a clear sight line over the heads of those seated in front of them.  Originally employed for flat-screen [[IMAX]] viewing (which has a very tall screen) this feature has proven popular with theatre patrons.

Rows of seats are divided by one or more aisles so that there are seldom more than 20 seats in a row.  This allows easier access to seating, as the space between rows is very narrow. Depending on the angle of rake of the seats, the aisles have steps.  Each step in the aisles is outlined with small [[lighting|light]]s to prevent patrons from tripping in the darkened theatre.

=== Multiplexes and megaplexes ===
North America's first two-screen theatre, The [[Elgin Theatre (Ottawa)|Elgin Theatre]] was created in 1957 by Nat Taylor in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] when he expanded the 20 year old facility.  Taylor is credited as inventor of the multiplex or cineplex, and later founded the [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]], opening the 18-screen [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] Cineplex, the world's largest at the time.[http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10229]
   
Stanley Durwood of American Multi-Cinema (now [[AMC Theatres]]) pioneered what would become the ''multiplex'' in 1963 after realizing that he could operate several attached auditoriums with the same staff needed for one through careful management of the start times for each movie.

Since that time multiple-screen theatres have become the norm, and many existing venues have been retrofitted so that they have multiple auditoriums. A single lobby is shared among them.  Because of the late development of multiplexes, the term "cinema" or "theater" may refer either the whole complex or a single auditorium, and sometimes "screen" is used to refer to an auditorium.  

A popular movie may be shown on multiple screens at the same multiplex, which reduces the choice of movies but offers more choice of viewing times or a greater number of seats to accommodate patrons. Two or three screens may be created by dividing up an existing cinema (as Durwood did with his Roxy in 1964), but newly built multiplexes usually have at least six to eight screens, and often as many as twelve, fourteen or even sixteen. In these large modern theaters, an electronic display in the ticket hall often shows a list of movies with starting time, auditorium number, admission rating, and whether it is sold out. Sometimes the number of remaining available seats is shown as well. At the entrance of each auditorium there may be a one-line electronic display with the title of the movie. After the movie has started, it can display the title and time of the next scheduled showing.

Although definitions vary, a large multiplex with 20 or more screens is usually called a [[megaplex]]. The first megaplex is generally considered to be the [[Kinepolis]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], which opened in 1988 with 25 screens and a seating capacity of 7,500.  The first megaplex in the [[United States]] was Studio 28 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], which reopened in 1988 with 20 screens and a seating capacity of 6,000.

=== IMAX ===

[[IMAX]] is a system using film with more than 10 times the frame size of a 35mm film to produce image quality far superior to conventional film.  IMAX theaters use an oversized screen as well as special projectors.  The first permanent IMAX theater was at [[Ontario Place]] in [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto, Canada]].

===Drive-in ===

A [[Drive-in theater|drive-in movie theatre]] is basically an outdoor parking area with a screen at one end and a projection booth at the other. Moviegoers drive into the parking spaces which are sometimes sloped upwards at the front to give a more direct view of the movie screen.  Movies are usually viewed through the car windscreen (windshield) although some people prefer to sit on the hood of the car.  Sound is either provided through portable [[loudspeaker]]s located by each parking space, or is broadcast on an FM radio frequency, to be played through the car's stereo system.  Because of their outdoor nature, drive-ins usually only operate seasonally, and after sunset.  Drive-in movie theatres are mainly found in the [[United States]], where they were especially popular in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]].  They are now almost extinct.  In some cases, multiplex or megaplex theatres were built on the sites of former drive-in theatres.

===Other venues===
Some outdoor movie theatres are just cleared areas where the audience sits upon chairs or blankets and watch the movie on a temporary screen, or even the wall of a convenient building. There is a nice outdoor cinema along the seafront in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

In the late [[1990s]], student organizations in universities and schools started to show movies in auditoriums equipped with multimedia projectors. Before the ubiquity of classic and modern films in DVD and VHS formats, student groups at large universities often sponsored screenings of films on 16 mm projectors in lecture halls as a way to raise money. Many small colleges also had student-run film groups that projected 16 mm films on a regular basis to students.

Some alternative methods of showing movies have been popular in the past. In the [[1980s]] the introduction of [[VHS]] cassettes made possible video-salons, small rooms where visitors viewed the film on a large TV. These establishments were especially popular in the [[Soviet Union]], where official distribution companies were slow to adapt to changing demand, and so movie theatres could not show popular [[Hollywood]] and [[cinema of Asia|Asian films]].

Movies are also commonly shown on [[airliner]]s in flight, using large screens in each cabin or smaller screens for each group of rows or each individual seat; the [[airline]] company sometimes charges a fee for the [[headphones]] needed to hear the movie's sound. Movies can also be shown on [[train]]s.

==Programming==
Movie theaters may be classified by the type of movies or when they are shown:

*''First-run theater'': A theater that runs primarily [[mainstream]] film fare from the major film companies and [[film distributor|distributors]], during the initial new release period of each film.
*''Second-run'' or ''discount theater'': A theater that runs films that have already shown in the first-run theaters and presented at a lower ticket price. (These are sometimes known as [[dollar theaters]] or "Cheap Seats".)
*''Repertoire/repertory theater'' or ''arthouse'': A theater that presents more alternative and [[art film]]s as well as second-run and classic films (often known as an "Independent Cinema" in the UK).
*A ''sex theater'' or ''adult theater'' specializes in showing [[pornographic movie]]s.
*[[IMAX]] theaters can show conventional movies, but the major benefits of the IMAX system are only available when showing movies filmed using it. While a few mainstream feature films have been produced in IMAX, [[IMAX#Content|IMAX movies]] are often [[documentary film|documentaries]] featuring spectacular natural scenery, and may be limited to the 45-minute length of a single reel of IMAX film.

==Presentation ==
Usually an admission is for one [[feature film]]. Sometimes two feature films are sold as one admission (''double feature''), with a break in between. Separate admission for a [[short subject]] is rare, it is either an extra before a feature film or part of a series of short subjects sold as one admission (this mainly occurs at film festivals). See also [[anthology film]].
 
Historically, many movie theatres presented a number of shorter items in addition to the feature film.  This might include a [[newsreel]], live-action comedy [[short film]]s, documentary short films, musical short films, and/or [[animated cartoon|cartoon shorts]] (many classic cartoons series such as the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' shorts were created for this purpose).  Some theatres ran on ''continuous showings'', where the same items would repeat throughout the day, with patrons arriving and departing at any time rather than having distinct entrance and exit cycles.  Newsreels gradually became obsolete by the 1960s with the rise of television news, and most material now shown prior to a feature film is of a commercial or promotional nature.  

A typical modern theatre presents [[television commercial|commercial advertising short]]s, then [[movie trailer]]s, and then the feature film.  Advertised start times are usually for the entire programme or session, not the feature itself.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4287273.stm "The love and loathing of cinema ads"], BBC News website, 23 February 2005</ref>

Thus people who want to avoid commercials might want to enter later, and those who want to avoid the trailers, again later. This is easiest and causes the least inconvenience when it is not crowded, and/or one is not very choosy about where one wants to sit. If one has a ticket for a specific seat (see below) one is formally assured of that, but it is still inconvenient and disturbing to find and claim it during the commercials and trailers, unless it is near an aisle.

Some movie theaters have some kind of [[intermission|break]] during the presentation.  There may also be a break between the introductory material and the feature. Some countries such as the [[Netherlands]] have a tradition of incorporating an intermission in regular feature presentations, though many theaters have now abandoned that tradition <ref>[http://www.boomchicago.nl/Section/Real-Amsterdam/330 BoomChicago.nl website]</ref>, while in North America this is very rare, and usually limited to special circumstances involving extremely long movies.

==Pricing and admission==
In order to obtain admission to a movie theater, the prospective theater-goer must usually purchase a [[ticket]], which may be for an arbitrary seat ("open" or "free" seating) or for a specific one. Movie theaters in North America generally have open seating.  Movie theaters in Europe can have free seating or have seating systems where the attendee can pick seats from a screen.

The price of a ticket may be discounted during off-peak times e.g. for [[wiktionary:matinée|matinées]], and higher at busy times, typically evenings and/or weekends. In [[Canada]], when this practice is used, it is traditional to offer the lower prices for Tuesday for all showings, one of the slowest days of the week in the movie theatre business, which has led to the nickname "cheap Tuesday."  Almost all movie theaters employ economic [[price discrimination]]: tickets for youth, students, and seniors are typically cheaper.
Large theater chains, such as AMC Theaters, also own smaller theaters that show "second runs" of popular films, at very reduced ticket prices.  

Some movie theaters and  chains sell passes for unlimited entrance.  Some examples:
:
*"Pathé Unlimited Card" (PUC) for the chain of 12 multi- and megaplex theatres of [[Movie theaters in the Netherlands|Pathé in the Netherlands]] (100 screens), for 17.50 euro/month; there are 15,000 pass holders (April 2006)
*"Unlimited Card" for the chain of movie theaters of [[Cineworld]] (formerly UGC) in the UK and Ireland, for £13.99/month, or £10.99 excluding those in London's West End. 
*Carte "Le Pass" for the chain of movie theatres of [[Pathé]]/[[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] in Paris, for 20 euro/month; ditto for each of a number of other French cities (same price, even though the pass is valid for much fewer screens)
*"UGC Illimité" pass for all [[UGC]] movie theaters in France, for 18 euro/month, and an entrance fee of 30 euro.
*"UGC Unlimited" pass for the four UGC movie theaters in Belgium, for 15 euro/month
*"SF Movie Passport" pass for all the movies shown in [[SF Group]] theaters in Thailand, valid for a month for one person and one show per movie, at the price of 800 [[baht]] or eqv USD 20

Note that in Thailand there is the restriction of one show per movie, while in the Netherlands one can see any movie as many times as one wants.

===Age restrictions ===
Admission to a movie may also be restricted by a [[motion picture rating system]]. According to such systems, children or teenagers below a certain age may be forbidden access to theaters showing certain movies, or only admitted when accompanied by a parent or other adult. In some jurisdictions a rating may legally impose this on movie theaters. Furthermore, where movie theaters do not have this legal obligation, they may enforce restrictions on their own.

Accordingly, a movie theater may either not be allowed to program an unrated film, or voluntarily refrain from that. In the US many mainstream movie theaters do not even show movies rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#The 5 ratings|NC-17]] ("No one 17 and under admitted"). Often, instead, an edited R-rated version ("Restricted. Persons under 17 are not admitted unless accompanied by parent or adult guardian.") is shown. {{dubious}}

===Ticket check; movie hopping===
In some movie theater complexes, the theaters are arranged such that tickets are checked at the entrance into the entire plaza, rather than before each theater.  This has led to ''movie hopping'', also called ''theater hopping'' and ''plexing'', the practice of buying a ticket for one film and illicitly attending additional showings within the complex without buying the required tickets. Younger patrons may also use this practice to enter auditoriums showing age-restricted movies.

At a theater with a sold-out show there is often an additional ticket check, to make sure that everybody with a ticket for that show can find a seat.

The lobby may be before or after the ticket check, see below.

===Revenue===
[[Movie studio]]s/[[film distributor]]s in the U.S. traditionally drive hard bargains entitling them to more than 70, 80, or 90% of the gross ticket revenue during the first week (and then the balance changes in 10% increments per week from there).<ref>Darren Filson, David Switzer and Portia Besocke, "At the movies: the economics of exhibition contracts," ''Economic Inquiry'' 43, no. 2 (April 2005): 354-370.</ref> See also '''[[box office]]'''.

==Movie theater culture==
Movie theaters are associated with [[dating]], [[3D glasses]], [[popcorn]] and expensive treats. It is rather common to throw and leave your garbage on the floor in a movie theater, than elsewhere, which is defiant to the cultural standard of cleaning up after oneself.

===Intimacy===
Sometimes couples go to a movie theater for the additional reason that it provides the possibility of some [[physical intimacy]], where the dark provides some privacy (with additional privacy in the back-row), i.e., the same amount of intimacy is a lesser form of [[public display of affection]]. This applies in particular for young people who still live with their parents, and these parents tend to monitor and/or forbid certain activities, and in the case of other social or even legal problems with public displays of affection. Compared with being together in a room without other people, it may also be reassuring for one or both of the couple (and for parents) that the intimacy is necessarily limited.

[[Chair#Armrests|Arm rests]] pose a hindrance to intimacy. Some theaters have love seats: seats for two without an armrest in the middle. The most modern theaters have movable armrests throughout the theater that when down can hold a food container as well as act as an armrest or partition between the seats and when up allow closer contact between the couple. More expensive theaters may have large comfortable sofas.

===Lobby, food and drinks===
Movie theaters usually sell various [[snack food]]s and drinks on [[concession stand]]s. There may be a counter, selfservice where one pays at the counter, and/or coin-operated machines. Sometimes the area of sale is more like a self-service shop than a lobby (it is not suitable for consuming the goods), and one pays at the check-out between the shop and the area with the screens.

The facilities for buying snacks and drinks often represent the theater's primary source of profit since most of the ticket revenue goes to the film distributor (and onward to the movie studio). Some movie theaters forbid eating and drinking inside the viewing room (restricting such activities to the lobby), while others encourage it by such devices as selling large portions of [[popcorn]]; in either case, bringing one's own food and drinks may be forbidden. Concessions is currently a huge area of expansion with many companies in the U.S. offering a wider range of snacks, including [[hot dog]]s and [[nacho]]s. The noise of people eating, including the opening of wrappers, is frowned upon by some moviegoers.

Many theaters have embraced the "brew and view" concept, serving alcoholic beverages, in addition to snacks and popcorn.  Some movie theaters offer full restaurant service at one's seat, though this is not as widespread.  [[McMenamins]] is a chain of [[restaurant]]/[[brewpub]] establishments in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington]], many of which have full movie theaters.

The lobby may be before or after the ticket check. If it is after, sometimes entrance to the lobby is restricted to a specific time, such as half an hour before the movie starts.

It is quite common for the lobby to include an [[arcade game]] area.

Sometimes moviegoing teenagers throw various foodstuffs &mdash; most notably [[popcorn]] &mdash; at each other, though sometimes at other moviegoers. This is frowned upon by management. In Ireland, mobile phones have also been banned in all cinemas, with some going to the extreme of installing equipment that blocks mobile phone signals.

==Business practice controversies==
*''Advertising'' - Many filmgoers complain about [[television commercial|commercial advertising short]]s, arguing that their absence would be one of the main advantages of going to a movie theater. Other critics such as [[Roger Ebert]] have expressed concerns that these advertisements, plus an excessive number of [[movie trailer]]s, could lead to pressure to restrict the preferred length of the feature films themselves to facilitate playing schedules.  So far, the theatre companies have typically been highly resistant to these complaints, citing the need for the supplementary income. Some chains like Famous Players and AMC Theatres have compromised with the commercials restricted to being shown before the scheduled start time for the trailers and the feature film. Individual theaters within a chain also sometimes adopt this policy.

*''Presentation'' - Another major recent concern is that the dramatic improvements in [[Sound reinforcement system|stereo sound systems]] have led to cinemas playing the soundtracks of presented films at unacceptably high volume levels. Usually, the trailers are presented at a very high sound level, presumably to overcome the sounds of a busy crowd. The sound is not adjusted downward for a sparsely occupied theater, and some patrons employ earplugs for the trailer period.

*''Piracy'' - In recent years cinemas have started to show warnings, before the movie starts, against using [[camera]]s and [[camcorder]]s during the movie. These warnings threaten customers with being removed from the cinema and arrested by the police. This example was shown at cinemas in the [[United Kingdom]]:

: ''You are not permitted to use any camera or recording equipment in this cinema. This will be treated as an attempt to breach copyright. Any person doing so can be ejected and such articles may be confiscated by the police. We ask the audience to be vigilant against any such activity and report any matters arousing suspicion to cinema staff. Thank you.'' 

:Some theaters (including those with IMAX stadiums) have detectors at the doors to pick up recording smugglers.

*''Crowd control'' - As movie theaters have grown into multiplexes and megaplexes, [[crowd control]] has become a major concern. An overcrowded megaplex can be rather unpleasant, and in an emergency can be extremely dangerous. Therefore, all major theater chains have implemented crowd control measures. The most well-known measure is the ubiquitous '''holdout line''' which prevents ticketholders for the next showing of that weekend's most popular movie from entering the building until their particular auditorium has been cleared out and cleaned. Since the 1980s, some theater chains (especially AMC Theatres) have developed a policy of co-locating their theaters in [[shopping center]]s (as opposed to the old practice of building stand-alone theaters). They deliberately build lobbies and corridors that cannot hold as many people as the auditoriums, thus making holdout lines necessary. In turn, ticketholders may be enticed to shop or eat while stuck outside in the holdout line.

*''Other Practices'' - The multiplex offers a great amount of flexibility to a theater operator, enabling multiple theaters to exhibit the same popular production in multiple theaters with staggered starting times.

The colocation of theaters and the rotation of start times results in a great economy of scale for the sale of so-called "[[junk food]]" &mdash; sugary soda pop, popcorn, and the like. In addition to poor nutritional values, the foodstuffs sold are also characterised by extremely high [[Markup (business)|markup]] and the profit from their sales can form the bulk of the [[Margin|gross margin]] of a theater.
