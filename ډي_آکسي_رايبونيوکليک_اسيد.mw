'''ډي آکسي رابونيوکليک اسيد''' (په انګرېزي: '''DeoxyriboNucleic Acid''') يو ډول [[نيوکليک اسيد]] دی چې د ژوندي اورګانيزمونو د کړنو، دندو او ودې جنيټيکي لارښوونې په ځان کې لري. د ځينو [[ويروس|ويروسونو]] او د [[آر ان اې (RNA)|آر ان اې]] د [[جينوم|جينومونو]] په استثنا، نور ټول ژوندي د ډي ان اې نه برخمن دي. په ژونکو (سلولونو) کې د ډي ان اې اهمه دنده د اوږدمهالو جنيټيکي مالوماتو زېرمه کول دي. په ډي ان اې کې شته جنيټيکي عملي لارښوونې، په ژونکو کې د پروټينونو او د آر ان اې د ماليکيولونو په جوړولو کې کارېږي. د ډي ان اې هغه برخې چې د ځان سره جنيټيکي مالومات لېږدوي د [[جين]] په نامه يادېږي، خو د ډي ان اې ځينې نورې کړۍ، د جوړېدو او رغولو په مقصد کارېږي او يا هم دا سلسلې د جنيټيکي مالوماتو په څرګندولو او منظم کولو کې ښکېل دي. د کيميايي جوړښت له مخې ډي ان اې له دوؤ اوږدؤ پوليميري ريتاړو، چې جوړښتي يوونونه (واحدونه) يې [[نيوکليوټايډ|نيوکليوټايډونه]] دي جوړه شوې. د ډي ان اې همدا [[پوليمر|پوليمري]] ريتاړې د يو ډول کيميايي شمزۍ چې د قندونو او فاسفېټونو د ډلو نه جوړه ده سره يوځای نښلوي. د ډي ان اې دا دوه ريتاړې يو بل ته په موازي ډول پرتې دي. د ډي ان اې شمزۍ په ځان کې څلور ډوله ماليکيولونه لري چې د [[نيوکليوبېز|بېزونو]] په نامه يادېږي او دا د همدغو څلورو بېزونو د تسلسل سبب دی چې جنيټيکي مالومات د کوډونو په توګه خوندي پراته دي. د ډي ان اې تر ټولو لويه دنده د جنيټيکي کوډونو په کارولو سره د [[امينو اسيد|امينو اسيدو]] د لړۍ نه د [[پروټين|پروټينو]] جوړېدنه ده. 

په [[ايوکاريوټ|ايوکاريوټونو]] کې لکه ژوي او بوټي، ډي ان اې د ژونکو په هستو کې وي، خو په [[پروکاريوټ|پروکاريوټونو]] کې لکه [[باکټريا]]، ډي ان اې د ژونکو په [[سايټوپلازم]] کې موندل کېږي. [[انزايم|انزايمونو]] ته ناورته، ډي ان اې په ماليکيولونو مستقيمه اغېزه نه لري، بلکه د بېلابېلو انزايمونه کړنې ډي ان اې اغېزمن کوي، او د نورو ډي ان اې په جوړولو کې، د ډي ان اې په ريپلېکېشن يا تکرار او يا هم د پروټيونو په ټرانسکرايب يا مخليکنې کې د ډي ان اې مالومات کاپي کوي. په [[کروموزوم|کروموزومونو]] کې، [[کروماټين|کروماټيني]] پروټين لکه [[هېسټون|هېسټونونه]]، ډي ان اې سره راټولوي او منظموي يې. همدا شان په هستې کې دننه، کروموزومونه د نورو پروټينو سره، د خپلمنځي تعاملاتو په کنټرول کې مرسته کوي.

The nucleotide repeats contain both the backbone of the molecule, which holds the chain together, and a base, which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix. In general, a base linked to a sugar is called a [[nucleoside]] and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a [[nucleotide]]. If multiple nucleotides are linked together, as in DNA, this polymer is referred to as a [[polynucleotide]].<ref name=IUPAC>[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html Abbreviations and Symbols for Nucleic Acids, Polynucleotides and their Constituents] IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN) Accessed 03 Jan 2006</ref>

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating [[phosphate]] and [[sugar]] residues.<ref name=Ghosh>{{cite journal | author = Ghosh A, Bansal M | title = A glossary of DNA structures from A to Z | journal = Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr | volume = 59 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 620-6 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12657780}}</ref> The sugar in DNA is the [[pentose]] (five carbon) sugar 2-deoxyribose. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon atoms in the sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand. This arrangement of DNA strands is called antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of a strand of DNA bases are referred to as the [[5' end|5']] (''five prime'') and [[3' end|3']] (''three prime'') ends. One of the major differences between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with 2-deoxyribose being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.<ref name=berg/>

The DNA double helix is held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the bases attached to the two strands. The four bases found in DNA are [[adenine]] (abbreviated A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G) and [[thymine]] (T). These four bases are shown below and are attached to the sugar/phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate.

These bases are classified into two types, adenine and guanine are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s called [[purine]]s, while cytosine and thymine are six-membered rings called [[pyrimidine]]s.<ref name=IUPAC/> A fifth pyrimidine base, called [[uracil]] (U), replaces thymine in [[RNA]] and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. Uracil is normally only found in DNA as a breakdown product of cytosine, but a very rare exception to this rule is a [[phage|bacterial virus]] called PBS1 that contains uracil in its DNA.<ref name="nature1963-takahashi">{{cite journal | author=Takahashi I, Marmur J. | title=Replacement of thymidylic acid by deoxyuridylic acid in the deoxyribonucleic acid of a transducing phage for Bacillus subtilis | journal=Nature | year=1963 | pages=794-5 | volume=197 | id=PMID 13980287}}</ref>

The double helix is a right-handed spiral. As the DNA strands wind around each other, they leave gaps between each set of phosphate backbones, revealing the sides of the bases inside (see animation). There are two of these grooves twisting around the surface of the double helix: one groove is 22&nbsp;angstroms wide and the other 12&nbsp;angstroms wide.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson R | title = Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5784 | pages = 755-8 | year = 1980 | id = PMID 7432492}}</ref> The larger groove is called the major groove, while the smaller, narrower groove is called the minor groove. The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually read the sequence by making contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pabo C, Sauer R | title = Protein-DNA recognition | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 293-321 | year = | id = PMID 6236744}}</ref>

=== Base pairing ===
{{further|[[Base pair]]}}
Each type of base on one strand forms a bond with just one type of base on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with A bonding only to T, and C bonding only to G. This arrangement of two nucleotides joined together across the double helix is called a base pair. In a double helix, the two strands are also held together by [[force]]s generated by the [[hydrophobic effect]] and [[pi stacking]], but these forces are not affected by the sequence of the DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ponnuswamy P, Gromiha M | title = On the conformational stability of oligonucleotide duplexes and tRNA molecules | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 169 | issue = 4 | pages = 419-32 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 7526075}}</ref> As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub H | title = Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1300792&blobtype=pdf | journal = Biophys J | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 1997-2007 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10733978}}</ref> As a result of this complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. Indeed, this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.<ref name=Alberts/>

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of [[hydrogen bond]]s, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, left). The GC base-pair is therefore stronger than the AT base pair. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determine the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC content have strongly interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weakly interacting strands.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Chalikian T, Völker J, Plum G, Breslauer K | title = A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=22151&blobtype=pdf | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 7853-8 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 10393911}}</ref> Parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in bacterial [[promoter]]s, tend to have sequences with a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.<ref>{{cite journal | author = deHaseth P, Helmann J | title = Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 817-24 | year = 1995 | id = PMID 7476180}}</ref> In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature required to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[melting temperature]] (also called ''T<sub>m</sub>'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J | title = Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 51 | pages = 15996-6010 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15609994}}</ref> The base pairing, or lack of it, can create various topologies at the [[DNA end]]. These can be exploited in [[biotechnology]].

=== Sense and antisense ===
{{further|[[Sense (molecular biology)]]}}

DNA is copied into RNA by [[RNA polymerase]] enzymes that only work in the 5' to 3' direction.<ref name=Joyce>{{cite journal | author = Joyce C, Steitz T | title = Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=177480&blobtype=pdf | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 177 | issue = 22 | pages = 6321-9 | year = 1995 | id = PMID 7592405}}</ref> A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is copied by these enzymes and then translated into protein. The sequence on the opposite strand is complementary to the sense sequence and is therefore called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense sequences are transcribed, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N | title = Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 289-97 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15851066}}</ref> One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Munroe S | title = Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns | journal = J Cell Biochem | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 664-71 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15389973}}</ref>

A few DNA sequences in [[prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryotes]], and more in [[plasmids]] and [[viruses]], blur the distinction made above between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Makalowska I, Lin C, Makalowski W | title = Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes | journal = Comput Biol Chem | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1-12 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15680581}}</ref> In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read 5' to 3' along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction (still 5' to 3') along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Johnson Z, Chisholm S | title = Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes | journal = Genome Res | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 2268-72 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15520290}}</ref> While in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lamb R, Horvath C | title = Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 261-6 | year = 1991 | id = PMID 1771674}}</ref> Another way of reducing genome size is seen in some viruses that contain linear or circular single-stranded DNA as their genetic material.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Davies J, Stanley J | title = Geminivirus genes and vectors | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 77-81 | year = 1989 | id = PMID 2660364}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Berns K | title = Parvovirus replication | journal = Microbiol Rev | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 316-29 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2215424}}</ref>

=== Supercoiling ===
{{Further|[[DNA supercoil]]}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. Normally, with DNA in its "relaxed" state a strand circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Benham C, Mielke S | title = DNA mechanics | journal = Annu Rev Biomed Eng | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 21-53 | year = | id = PMID 16004565}}</ref> If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix this is positive supercoiling and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction this is negative supercoiling and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called [[topoisomerase]]s.<ref name=Champoux>{{cite journal | author = Champoux J | title = DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 369-413 | year = | id = PMID 11395412}}</ref> These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as [[transcription]] and [[DNA replication]].<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal | author = Wang J | title = Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective | journal = Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 430-40 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12042765}}</ref>

Which conformation DNA adopts depends on the sequence of the DNA, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases and also solution conditions, such as the concentration of metal ions and [[polyamine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Basu H, Feuerstein B, Zarling D, Shafer R, Marton L | title = Recognition of Z-RNA and Z-DNA determinants by polyamines in solution: experimental and theoretical studies | journal = J Biomol Struct Dyn | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 299-309 | year = 1988 | id = PMID 2482766}}</ref> Of these three conformations, the "B" form described above is most common under the conditions found in cells. The two alternative double-helical forms of DNA differ in their geometry and dimensions.

The A form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow and wide minor groove and a narrower and deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological conditions in dehydrated samples of DNA, while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wahl M, Sundaralingam M | title = Crystal structures of A-DNA duplexes | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 45-63 | year = 1997 | id = PMID 9097733}}</ref> Segments of DNA where the bases have been [[methylation|methylated]] may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the [[Z-DNA|Z form]].

=== Quadruplex structures ===
At the ends of the linear [[chromosome]]s are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme [[telomerase]], as normal [[DNA polymerase]]s working on the [[lagging strand]] cannot copy the extreme 3' ends of their DNA templates.<ref name=Greider>{{cite journal | author = Greider C, Blackburn E | title = Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts | journal = Cell | volume = 43 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 405-13 | year = 1985 | id = PMID 3907856}}</ref> If a chromosome lacked telomeres it would become shorter each time it was replicated.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilise chromosome ends by forming very unusual quadruplex structures.

The expression of genes is influenced by modifications of the bases in DNA.

DNA can be damaged by many different sorts of [[mutagen]]s. These include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[alkylating agent]]s and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet light]] and [[x-rays]].

== Overview of biological functions ==
DNA contains the genetic [[information]] that allows living things to function, grow and reproduce. This information is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. Genetic information in genes is transmitted through complementary base pairing. For example, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence in a process called transcription. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation. Alternatively, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles, here we focus on the interactions that happen in these processes between DNA and other molecules.

=== Transcription and translation ===
{{further|[[Genetic code]], [[Transcription (genetics)]], [[Protein biosynthesis]]}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence which then defines a protein sequence. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT). In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into [[messenger RNA]] by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (<math>4^3</math> combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]]. Most amino acids, therefore, have more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region, these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

[[دوتنه:Dnareplication.png|frame|DNA replication. The double helix (blue) is unwound by a [[helicase]]. Next, [[DNA polymerase III]] (green) produces the [[leading strand]] copy (red). A DNA polymerase I molecule (green) binds to the [[lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] (violet) joins them together.]]

=== Replication ===
{{further|[[DNA replication]]}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but when a cell divides it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5' to 3' direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Albà M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11178285 | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11178285}}</ref> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

== Genes and genomes ==
{{further|[[Cell nucleus]], [[Gene]], [[Non-coding DNA]]}}
DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]] of eukaryotes, as well as small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = J Cell Biochem | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15988757}}</ref> The DNA is usually in linear [[chromosome]]s in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. In the [[human genome]], there is approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Venter J, ''et al.'' | title = The sequence of the human genome | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = 5507 | pages = 1304-51 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11181995}}</ref> The genetic information in a genome is held within [[gene]]s. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, as well as [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter]]s and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control the expression of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the [[human genome]] consists of protein-coding [[exons]], with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wolfsberg T, McEntyre J, Schuler G | title = Guide to the draft human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 824-6 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11236998}}</ref> The reasons for the presence of so much [[non-coding DNA]] in [[eukaryotic]] genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species represent a long-standing puzzle known as the "[[C-value enigma]]".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gregory T | title = The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/1/133 | journal = Ann Bot (Lond) | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 133-46 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15596463}}</ref>

Some non-coding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes.

== Interactions with proteins ==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can either be non-specific, or the protein can only bind to a particular DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes between DNA and structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sandman K, Pereira S, Reeve J | title = Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal = Cell Mol Life Sci | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350-64 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9893710}}</ref> The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a [[nucleosome]], which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones making [[ionic bond]]s to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are therefore largely independent of the base sequence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Luger K, Mäder A, Richmond R, Sargent D, Richmond T | title = Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 6648 | pages = 251-60 | year = 1997 | id = PMID 9305837}}</ref> Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include [[methylation]], [[phosphorylation]] and [[acetylation]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jenuwein T, Allis C | title = Translating the histone code | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5532 | pages = 1074-80 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11498575}}</ref> These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to [[transcription factor]]s and changing the rate of [[transcription]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ito T | title = Nucleosome assembly and remodelling | journal = Curr Top Microbiol Immunol | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 1-22 | year = | id = PMID 12596902}}</ref> Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins found in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind preferentially to bent or distorted DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thomas J | title = HMG1 and 2: architectural DNA-binding proteins | journal = Biochem Soc Trans | volume = 29 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 395-401 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11497996}}</ref> These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into more complex chromatin structures.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Grosschedl R, Giese K, Pagel J | title = HMG domain proteins: architectural elements in the assembly of nucleoprotein structures | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 94-100 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 8178371}}</ref>

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-characterised member of this family and is essential for most processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec J | title = Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal = Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 141-80 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 10473346}}</ref> These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to specifically bind particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various classes of [[transcription factor]]s. These proteins control gene transcription. Each one of these proteins bind to one particular set of DNA sequences and thereby activates or inhibits the transcription of genes with these sequences close to their [[promoter]]s. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins, this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Myers L, Kornberg R | title = Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 729-49 | year = | id = PMID 10966474}}</ref> Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter, this will change the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Spiegelman B, Heinrich R | title = Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal = Cell | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 157-67 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15479634}}</ref>

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee W, Zhang M, Ren B | title = A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12808131 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 14 | pages = 8164-9 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12808131}}</ref> Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that mediate responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the DNA sequence. Most of these base interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pabo C, Sauer R | title = Protein-DNA recognition | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 293-321 | year = | id = PMID 6236744}}</ref>

=== DNA-modifying enzymes ===
==== Nucleases and ligases ====
Nucleases are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently-used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5'-GAT|ATC-3' and makes a cut at the vertical line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bickle T, Krüger D | title = Biology of DNA restriction | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=372918&blobtype=pdf | journal = Microbiol Rev | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434-50 | year = 1993 | id = PMID 8336674}}</ref> In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[clone (genetics)|molecular cloning]] and [[DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands, using the energy from either [[adenosine triphosphate]] or [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]].<ref name=Doherty>{{cite journal | author = Doherty A, Suh S | title = Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases. | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11058099 | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 28 | issue = 21 | pages = 4051-8 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 11058099}}</ref> Ligases are particularly important in [[lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].<ref name=Doherty/>

==== Topoisomerases and helicases ====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzyme work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling, the enzyme then seals the DNA break.<ref name=Champoux/> Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schoeffler A, Berger J | title = Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal = Biochem Soc Trans | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1465-70 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16246147}}</ref> Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.<ref name=Wang/>

Helicases are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[adenosine triphosphate]] to break the hdrogen bonds between bases and unwind a DNA double helix into single strands.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tuteja N, Tuteja R | title = Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111%2Fj.1432-1033.2004.04094.x | journal = Eur J Biochem | volume = 271 | issue = 10 | pages = 1849-63 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15128295}}</ref> These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

==== Polymerases ====
Polymerases are enzymes that synthesise polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. They function by adding nucleotides onto the 3ˈ [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl group]] of the previous nucleotide in the DNA strand. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5' to 3' direction.<ref name=Joyce/> In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the nucleoside triphosphate substrate base-pairs to a single-stranded polynucleotide template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesise the complementary strand of this template. Polymerases are classified depending of the type of template they use.

In [[DNA replication]] a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] make a DNA copy of a DNA sequence. Accuracy is vital in this process, so many of these polymerases have a [[proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3' to 5' [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 133-63 | year = | id = PMID 12045093}}</ref> In most organisms DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Johnson A, O'Donnell M | title = Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal = Annu Rev Biochem | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 283-315 | year = | id = PMID 15952889}}</ref>

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialised class of polymerases that copy the sequence of a RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of [[telomere]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola M, Nevinsky G, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S | title = The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/8/8/497 | journal = FASEB J | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 497-503 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 7514143}}</ref><ref name=Greider/> Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure.<ref name=Nugent/>

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a [[promoter]] and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the [[human genome]], operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Martinez E | title = Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal = Plant Mol Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 925-47 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12516863}}</ref>

{{further|[[Genetic recombination]]}}
[[دوتنه:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|250px|left|Recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two re-arranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix does not usually interact with other segments of DNA and in human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "chromosome territories".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cremer T, Cremer C | title = Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 292-301 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11283701}}</ref> This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is when they [[genetic recombination|recombine]]. Recombination is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin. In eukaryotes this process usually occurs during [[meiosis]], when the two sister [[chromatid]]s are paired together in the center of the cell. Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pál C, Papp B, Lercher M | title = An integrated view of protein evolution | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 337-48 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16619049}}</ref> Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Driscoll M, Jeggo P | title = The role of double-strand break repair - insights from human genetics | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45-54 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16369571}}</ref>

The most common form of recombination is [[chromosomal crossover|homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as ''recombinases'', such as [[Cre recombinase]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ghosh K, Van Duyne G | title = Cre-loxP biochemistry | journal = Methods | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 374-83 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12431441}}</ref> In the first step, the recombinase creates a nick in one strand of a DNA double helix, allowing the nicked strand to pull apart from its [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand and [[Annealing (biology)|anneal]] to one strand of the double helix on the opposite chromatid. A second nick allows the strand in the second chromatid to pull apart and anneal to the remaining strand in the first helix, forming a structure known as a ''cross-strand exchange'' or a [[Holliday junction]]. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure which can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dickman M, Ingleston S, Sedelnikova S, Rafferty J, Lloyd R, Grasby J, Hornby D | title = The RuvABC resolvasome | journal = Eur J Biochem | volume = 269 | issue = 22 | pages = 5492-501 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12423347}}</ref>

== Uses in technology ==
=== Forensics ===
{{further|[[Genetic fingerprinting]]}}

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] at a crime scene to identify a perpetrator. This process is called [[genetic fingerprinting]] or more accurately, DNA profiling. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeats]] and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a criminal.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins A, Morton N | title = Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/13/6007.pdf | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 91 | issue = 13 | pages = 6007-11 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 8016106}}</ref> However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Weir B, Triggs C, Starling L, Stowell L, Walsh K, Buckleton J | title = Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal = J Forensic Sci | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213-22 | year = 1997 | id = PMID 9068179}}</ref> DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jeffreys A, Wilson V, Thein S | title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA. | journal = Nature | volume = 316 | issue = 6023 | pages = 76-9 | year = | id = PMID 2989708}}</ref> and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Enderby murders]] case.<ref>[http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork - first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 Dec 2006</ref> People convicted of certain types of crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for a database. This has helped investigators solve old cases where only a DNA sample was obtained from the scene. DNA profiling can also be used to identify victims of mass casualty incidents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |date=September 2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}</ref>

=== Bioinformatics ===
{{further|[[Bioinformatics]]}}
[[Bioinformatics]] involves the manipulation, searching, and [[data mining]] DNA sequence data. The development of techniques to store and search DNA sequences have led to widely-applied advances in [[computer science]], especially [[string searching algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]] and [[database theory]].<ref>Baldi, Pierre. Brunak, Soren. ''Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach'' MIT Press (2001) ISBN 978-0-262-02506-5</ref> String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, was developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides.<ref>Gusfield, Dan. ''Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology''. Cambridge University Press, 15 January [[1997]]. ISBN 978-0-521-58519-4.</ref> In other applications such as [[text editor]]s, even simple algorithms for this problem usually suffice, but DNA sequences cause these algorithms to exhibit near-worst-case behaviour due to their small number of distinct characters. The related problem of [[sequence alignment]] aims to identify [[homology (biology)|homologous]] sequences and locate the specific [[mutation]]s that make them distinct. These techniques, especially [[multiple sequence alignment]], are used in studying [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationships and [[protein]] function.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sjölander K | title = Phylogenomic inference of protein molecular function: advances and challenges | url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/2/170 | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 170-9 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 14734307}}</ref> Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the [[Human Genome Project]], are difficult to use without annotations, which label the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by [[gene finding]] algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular [[gene product]]s in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally.<ref name="Mount">{{cite book|author = Mount DM | title = Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis | edition = 2 | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location | Cold Spring Harbor, NY | date = 2004 | isbn = 0879697121}}</ref>

=== DNA and computation ===
{{further|[[DNA computing]]}}
DNA was first used in computing to solve a small version of the directed [[Hamiltonian path problem]], an [[NP-complete]] problem.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adleman L | title = Molecular computation of solutions to combinatorial problems | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5187 | pages = 1021-4 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 7973651}}</ref> [[DNA computing]] is advantageous over electronic computers in power use, space use, and efficiency, due to its ability to compute in a highly parallel fashion (see [[parallel computing]]). A number of other problems, including simulation of various [[abstract machine]]s, the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], and the bounded version of the [[travelling salesman problem]], have since been analysed using DNA computing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parker J | title = Computing with DNA. | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12524509 | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 7-10 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12524509}}</ref> Due to its compactness, DNA also has a theoretical role in [[cryptography]], where in particular it allows unbreakable [[one-time pad]]s to be efficiently constructed and used.<ref>Ashish Gehani, Thomas LaBean and John Reif. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/gehani99dnabased.html DNA-Based Cryptography].
Proceedings of the 5th DIMACS Workshop on DNA Based Computers, Cambridge, MA, USA, 14 – 15 June 1999.</ref>

=== History and anthropology ===
{{further|[[Phylogenetics]]}}
Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information and by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their [[phylogeny]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wray G | title = Dating branches on the tree of life using DNA | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11806830 | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS0001 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11806830}}</ref> This field of [[phylogenetics]] is a powerful tool in [[evolutionary biology]]. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, [[population genetics|population geneticists]] can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from [[ecological genetics]] to [[anthropology]], for example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]].<ref>''Lost Tribes of Israel'', [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]], PBS airdate: 22 February 2000. Transcript available from [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2706israel.html PBS.org,] (last accessed on 4 March 2006)</ref><ref>Kleiman, Yaakov.

Accessed 4 March 2006.</ref>

DNA has also been used to look at modern family relationships, such as establishing family relationships between the descendants of [[Sally Hemings]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. This usage is closely related to the use of DNA in criminal investigations detailed above. Indeed, some criminal investigations have been solved when DNA from crime scenes has matched relatives of the guilty individual.<ref>Bhattacharya, Shaoni.

== تاريخ ==

{{further|[[History of molecular biology]]}}
DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] who discovered a substance he called "nuclein" in 1869.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dahm R | title = Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA | journal = Dev Biol | volume = 278 | issue = 2 | pages = 274-88 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15680349}}</ref> In 1929 this discovery was followed by [[Phoebus Levene]]'s identification of the base, sugar and phosphate nucleotide unit.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Levene P, | title = The structure of yeast nucleic acid | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/40/2/415 | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 415-24 | year = 1919}}</ref> Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups. However Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In 1937 [[William Astbury]] produced the first [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Astbury W, | title = Nucleic acid | journal = Symp. SOC. Exp. Bbl | volume = 1 | issue = 66 | year = 1947}}</ref>

In 1943, [[Oswald Theodore Avery]] discovered that traits of the "smooth" form of the ''Pneumococcus'' could be transferred to the "rough" form of the same bacteria by mixing killed "smooth" bacteria with the live "rough" form. Avery identified DNA as this [[transforming principle]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avery O, MacLeod C, McCarty M | title = Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types. Inductions of transformation by a desoxyribonucleic acid fraction isolated from pneumococcus type III | url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/reprint/149/2/297 | journal = J Exp Med | volume = 149 | issue = 2 | pages = 297-326 | year = 1979 | id = PMID 33226}}</ref> DNA's role in heredity was confirmed in 1953, when [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] in the [[Hershey-Chase experiment]], showed that DNA is is the [[genetic material]] of the [[T2 phage]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hershey A, Chase M | title = Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage | url=http://www.jgp.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/39.pdf | journal = J Gen Physiol | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 39-56 | year = 1952 | id = PMID 12981234}}</ref>

Using [[X-ray diffraction]] data from [[Rosalind Franklin]] and the information that the bases were paired, [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] produced the first accurate model of DNA structure in 1953 in their article [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|The Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids]].<ref name=Watson/> Watson and Crick proposed the [[central dogma]] of molecular biology in 1957, describing how proteins are produced from [[cell nucleus|nucleic]] DNA. In 1962 Watson, Crick, and [[Maurice Wilkins]] jointly received the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 Dec 06</ref>

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the "[[Central Dogma]]", which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the "adaptor hypothesis".<ref>Crick, F.H.C. [http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf On degenerate templates and the adaptor hypothesis (PDF).] genome.wellcome.ac.uk (Lecture, 1955). Accessed 22 Dec 2006</ref> Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the [[Meselson-Stahl experiment]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Meselson M, Stahl F | title = The replication of DNA in Escherichia coli | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 671-82 | year = 1958 | id = PMID 16590258}}</ref> Further work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, allowing [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] to decipher the [[genetic code]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1968] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 Dec 06</ref> These findings represent the birth of [[molecular biology]].
