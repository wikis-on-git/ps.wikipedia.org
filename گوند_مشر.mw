The party leader is typically responsible for managing the party's relationship with the general public. As such, he or she will take a leading role in developing and communicating [[party policy]], especially election platforms, to the electorate. He or she is also typically the public face of the party and the principal media contact.

In many [[representative democracy|representative democracies]], party leaders compete directly for high [[political office]]. For example, leaders of parties in [[presidential republic|presidential]] and [[semi-presidential republic]]s will often run for [[President]]. In [[parliamentary]] systems of government, party leaders typically seek to become [[prime minister]]. It is thus typical in such states (e.g., in the [[Westminster system]]) for the party leader to seek election to the [[legislature]], and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's [[parliamentary group leader|parliamentary leader]]. 

Sometimes, a party leader will simultaneously hold the post of [[party chair|chairman]]. However, this is rare in the [[Westminster system]].

The method of selection of the party leader varies from party to party, though often it will involve an election involving all or part of the party membership. In some parties, only current members of the [[parliamentary party]], or particular party office holders, may vote; in others, such as the [[British Labour Party]], though the entire membership is eligible to vote, some electors may have a much larger share of the vote than others (see also [[Superdelegate]] for a similar concept). If only one candidate emerges, he or she is said to have been "elected by [[acclamation]]" or "[[ratify|ratified]]" by the general membership (sometimes the term "[[anointing|anointed]]" is used informally or in media discourse). In [[Canada]], all major parties elect their leaders at a [[leadership convention]].

The leaders of [[Communist party|communist parties]] often hold the title of [[General secretary]] (eg. [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]).
