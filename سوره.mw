'''Sura''' (sometimes spelt "Surah" {{lang|ar|سورة}} ''{{ArabDIN|sūrah}}'', plural "Suwar" {{lang|ar|سور}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term literally meaning "something enclosed or surrounded by a fence or wall." The term is commonly used to mean a "chapter" of the [[Qur'an]], each of which is traditionally ordered roughly in reverse order to its length. Each Sura is named for a word or name mentioned in an [[ayah]] (section), of that 'Sura'. Some 'Sura' were surprising to Muslims at the time of the 'Revelation'; for example, the elevated status of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] - a Jewish woman and the mother of the Christian [[Jesus]] at the time of the 'Revelation' - which is mentioned in [[Sura 19]] ("Maryam/Mary").
