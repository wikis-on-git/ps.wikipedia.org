'''Negara Brunei Darussalam''', more commonly referred to as the '''Sultanate of Brunei''' or simply '''Brunei''', is a country located on the [[island]] of [[Borneo]], in [[southeast Asia]]. Apart from its coastline with the [[South China Sea]], it is completely surrounded by [[East Malaysia]]. The [[Petroleum ]] and [[natural gas|gas]]-rich Brunei is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the (British) [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== تاريخ==
[[Image:Brunei3.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Brunei on Borneo, shown <font color=green>in green</font>.]]
{{main|History of Brunei}}

The [[Sultanate]] of Brunei was very powerful from the [[14th century|14th]] through the [[16th century]]. Its realm covered the southern [[Philippines]], [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]]. [[Europe]]an influence gradually brought an end to this [[regional power]]. Later, there was a brief war with [[Spain]] in which Brunei was victorious. The [[19th century]] however saw Brunei losing much of its territory to the [[White Rajahs]] of Sarawak.

There was a small [[rebellion]] against the [[monarchy]] during the [[1960s]], which was prevented by the [[United Kingdom]]. This event became known as the [[Brunei Revolt]] and was partly responsible for the failure to create the [[North Borneo Federation]]. The rebellion also affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the [[Malaysia|Malaysian Federation]]. Brunei was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protectorate]] from [[1888]] to [[1984]].

== سياست==
{{main|Politics of Brunei}}

[[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]] of Brunei, whose [[List of Sultans of Brunei|title has passed within the same dynasty]] since the [[15th century]], is the head of state and head of government in Brunei. The Sultan is advised by several [[Council|councils]] and a cabinet of [[Minister|ministers]] although he is effectively the supreme ruler. The [[media]] is extremely pro-government and the Royal family retains an almost godlike status within the country. There is no elected [[legislative]] body. In September [[2004]] the Sultan convened an appointed [[Parliament]] which had not met since independence in [[1984]]. 

The country has been under hypothetical [[martial law]] since a rebellion occurred in the early [[1960s]] and was put down by [[United Kingdom|British]] troops from [[Singapore]]. A [[battalion]] from the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] is still stationed in Brunei under agreement with the Sultan to protect the [[petroleum|oil]] [[Oil field|fields]] in the West of the country. Other units from the British Army are present to support and train the [[Brunei Army]]. 

Brunei also claims territory in [[Sarawak]] and is one of many nations to lay claim to the disputed [[Spratly Islands]].

== Districts ==
[[Image:Brunei.geohive.gif|thumb|340px|right|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]
{{main|Districts of Brunei}}
Brunei is divided into four [[district]]s, called ''daerah''. These are:
* [[Belait District|Belait]]
* [[Brunei and Muara]]
* [[Temburong]]
* [[Tutong District|Tutong]]

A sub-division of a district, [[province]], is called ''Mukim''.

== جغرافيه==
{{main|Geography of Brunei}}

Brunei consists of two unconnected parts; 97% of the population lives in the larger western part, only about 10,000 live in the mountainous eastern part, the district of [[Temburong]]. Major towns are the capital [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] (about 46,000 inhabitants), the port town [[Muara]] and the oil producing districts of [[Seria]] and [[Kuala Belait]]. 

The [[climate]] in Brunei is [[equatorial]]-[[Tropical climate|tropical]], with high temperatures, a high [[humidity]] and heavy rainfall.

== اقتصاد==
{{main|Economy of Brunei}}
This small, [[Wealth|wealthy]] [[economic system|economy]] is a mixture of [[foreign]] and [[Domestic policy|domestic]] entrepreneurship, government regulation, [[social welfare|welfare]] measures, and [[village]] [[tradition]]. Crude [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] production account for nearly half of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all [[medical]] services and subsidizes [[rice]] and housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal [[social cohesion]] although it became a more prominent player by serving as [[chairman]] for the 2000 [[APEC]] (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Stated plans for the future include upgrading the [[labour (economics)|labor]] force, reducing [[unemployment]], strengthening the [[banking]] and [[Tourism|tourist]] sectors, and, in general, further widening the economic base.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Brunei}}

About two-thirds of the Brunei population are of [[Malay people|Malay]] origin. The most important [[Minority|ethnic minority group]] are the [[China|Chinese]], with about 15%. These groups also reflect the most important [[Language|languages]]: [[Malay language|Malay]], which is the official language, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. [[English language|English]] is also widely spoken and there is a relatively large [[expatriate]] community.

[[Islam]] is the official [[religion]] of Brunei, and the sultan is the head of the religion in the country. Other faiths practised are [[Buddhism]] (mainly by the Chinese), [[Christianity]] and very small communities still practice [[indigenous]] religions.

== کلتور/فرهڼ==
{{main|Culture of Brunei}}

The culture of Brunei is similar to Malay culture, with heavy influences from [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]].
