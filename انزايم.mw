'''Enzymes''' are [[protein]]s that [[catalysis|catalyze]] (''i.e.'' [[reaction rate|accelerate]]) [[chemical reaction]]s.<ref>Smith AD (Ed) ''et al.'' (1997) ''Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'' Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-854768-4</ref> In enzymatic reactions, the [[molecule]]s at the beginning of the process are called [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]], and the enzyme converts them into different molecules, the products. Almost all processes in a [[cell (biology)|biological cell]] need enzymes in order to occur at significant rates. Since enzymes are extremely selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which [[metabolic pathway]]s occur in that cell.

Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the [[activation energy]] (''E''<sub>a</sub> or Δ''G''<sup>‡</sup>) for a reaction, thus dramatically accelerating the rate of the reaction. Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable uncatalyzed reactions. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.expasy.org/NAR/enz00.pdf|author= Bairoch A.|year= 2000|title= The ENZYME database in 2000 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=28|pages=304–305|id= PMID 10592255 }}</ref> Although almost all enzymes are proteins, not all biochemical catalysts are enzymes, since some [[RNA]] molecules called [[ribozyme]]s also catalyze reactions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lilley D |title=Structure, folding and mechanisms of ribozymes |journal=Curr Opin Struct Biol |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=313-23 |year=2005 |pmid=15919196}}</ref> Synthetic molecules called [[artificial enzyme]]s also display enzyme-like catalysis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Groves JT |title=Artificial enzymes. The importance of being selective |journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6649 |pages=329-30 |year=1997 |pmid=9311771}}</ref>

Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules. [[enzyme inhibitor|Inhibitors]] are molecules that decrease enzyme activity; [[enzyme activator|activators]] are molecules that increase activity. Many [[drug]]s and [[poison]]s are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by [[temperature]], chemical environment (e.g. [[pH]]), and the [[concentration]] of substrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of [[antibiotic]]s. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions (''e.g.'', enzymes in biological [[washing powder]]s break down protein or [[fat]] stains on clothes; enzymes in [[meat tenderizer]]s break down proteins, making the meat easier to chew).

Enzymes are generally globular proteins and range from just 62 amino acid residues in size, for the [[monomer]] of [[4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase|4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen LH, Kenyon GL, Curtin F, Harayama S, Bembenek ME, Hajipour G, Whitman CP |title=4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase, an enzyme composed of 62 amino acid residues per monomer |journal=J.

The activities of enzymes are determined by their [[quaternary structure|three-dimensional structure]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anfinsen C.B.|year= 1973|title= Principles that Govern the Folding of Protein Chains|journal= Science|pages= 223–230|id= PMID 4124164}}</ref> Most enzymes are much larger than the substrates they act on, and only a small portion of the enzyme (around 3–4 [[amino acid]]s) is directly involved in catalysis.<ref>[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/CSA/ The Catalytic Site Atlas at The European Bioinformatics Institute] Accessed 04 April 2007</ref> The region that contains these catalytic residues, binds the substrate, and then carries out the reaction is known as the [[active site]]. Enzymes can also contain sites that bind [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]], which are needed for catalysis. Some enzymes also have binding sites for small molecules, which are often direct or [[#Metabolic pathways|indirect]] products or substrates of the reaction catalyzed. This binding can serve to increase or decrease the enzyme's activity, providing a means for [[feedback]] regulation.

Like all proteins, enzymes are made as long, linear chains of amino acids that [[protein folding|fold]] to produce a [[tertiary structure|three-dimensional product]]. Each unique amino acid sequence produces a specific structure, which has unique properties. Individual protein chains may sometimes group together to form a [[protein complex]]. Most enzymes can be [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]]—that is, unfolded and inactivated—by heating, which destroys the [[Tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]] of the protein. Depending on the enzyme, denaturation may be reversible or irreversible.

=== Specificity ===
Enzymes are usually very specific as to which reactions they catalyze and the [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] that are involved in these reactions. Complementary shape, charge and [[hydrophilic]]/[[hydrophobic]] characteristics of enzymes and substrates are responsible for this specificity. Enzymes can also show impressive levels of [[stereospecificity]], [[regioselectivity]] and [[chemoselectivity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Jaeger KE, Eggert T.|year= 2004|title= Enantioselective biocatalysis optimized by directed evolution.| journal=Curr Opin Biotechnol.|volume= 15(4)|pages= 305–313|id= PMID 15358000}}</ref>

Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and expression of the [[genome]]. These enzymes have "proof-reading" mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such as [[DNA polymerase]] catalyses a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Shevelev IV, Hubscher U.|year= 2002|title= The 3' 5' exonucleases.| journal= Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol.|volume= 3|issue= 5|pages= 364–376|id= PMID 11988770}}</ref> This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity [[mammal]]ian polymerases.<ref>Berg J., Tymoczko J. and Stryer L.

Freeman and Company ISBN 0-7167-4955-6</ref> Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in [[RNA polymerase]],<ref>{{cite journal |author= Zenkin N, Yuzenkova Y, Severinov K.|year= 2006|title= Transcript-assisted transcriptional proofreading.| journal= Science.|volume= 313|pages= 518–520|id= PMID 16873663}}</ref> [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ibba M, Soll D.|year= 2000|title= Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis.| journal= Annu Rev Biochem.|volume= 69|pages= 617–650|id= PMID 10966471}}</ref> and [[ribosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Rodnina MV, Wintermeyer W.|year= 2001|title= Fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection on the ribosome: kinetic and structural mechanisms.| journal= Annu Rev Biochem.|volume= 70|pages= 415–435|id= PMID 11395413}}</ref>

Some enzymes that produce [[secondary metabolite]]s are described as promiscuous, as they can act on a relatively broad range of different substrates. It has been suggested that this broad substrate specificity is important for the evolution of new biosynthetic pathways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~drf1/rdf_sp1.htm |title=The Screening Hypothesis - a new explanation of secondary product diversity and function |accessdate=2006-10-11 |last=Firn |first=Richard }}</ref>

==== "Lock and key" model ====
Enzymes are very specific, and it was suggested by [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] in 1894 that this was because both the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Fischer E.|year= 1894|title= Einfluss der Configuration auf die Wirkung der Enzyme| journal=Ber. Dt.
Chem. Ges.|volume=27|pages=2985–2993|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90736r/f364.chemindefer }}</ref> This is often referred to as "the lock and key" model. However, while this model explains enzyme specificity, it fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve.
The "lock and key" model has proven inaccurate and the induced fit model is the most currently accepted enzyme-substrate-coenzyme figure.

==== Induced fit model ====
[[دوتنه:Induced fit diagram.svg|thumb|450px|Diagrams to show the induced fit hypothesis of enzyme action.]]
In 1958 [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.|Daniel Koshland]] suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continually reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/44/2/98|author=Koshland D. E.|year= 1958|title= Application of a Theory of Enzyme Specificity to Protein Synthesis|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.|volume=44|issue=2|pages=98–104|id= PMID 16590179}}</ref> As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site, the amino acid [[side chain]]s which make up the active site are moulded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vasella A, Davies GJ, Bohm M.|year= 2002|title= Glycosidase mechanisms.|journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol.|volume=6|issue=5|pages=619–629|id= PMID 12413546}}</ref> The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge is determined.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Rodney |title=Concepts in Biochemistry |origyear=2002 |accessdate=2007-04-21 |edition=2nd ed.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |location=New York, Chichester, Weinheim, Brisbane, Singapore, Toronto. |language=English |isbn=0-470-00379-0 |pages=137–138 |chapter=6}}</ref>

=== Mechanisms ===

Enzymes can act in several ways, all of which lower ΔG<sup>‡</sup>:<ref>Fersht, A (1985) ''Enzyme Structure and Mechanism'' (2nd ed) p50–52 W H Freeman & co, New York ISBN 0-7167-1615-1</ref>

* Lowering the [[activation energy]] by creating an environment in which the transition state is stabilized (e.g. straining the shape of a substrate -  by binding the transition-state conformation of the substrate/product molecules, the enzyme distorts the bound substrate(s) into their transition state form, thereby reducing the amount of energy required to complete the transition).

* Lowering the energy of the transition state, but without distorting the substrate, by creating an environment with the opposite charge distribution to that of the transition state.

* Providing an alternative pathway. For example, temporarily reacting with the substrate to form an intermediate ES complex, which would be impossible in the absence of the enzyme.

* Reducing the reaction entropy change by bringing substrates together in the correct orientation to react. Considering ΔH<sup>‡</sup> alone overlooks this effect.

Interestingly, this entropic effect involves destabilization of the ground state,<ref> Jencks W.P. "Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology." 1987, Dover, New York </ref> and its contribution to catalysis is relatively small.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Villa J, Strajbl M, Glennon TM, Sham YY, Chu ZT, Warshel A |title=How important are entropic contributions to enzyme catalysis? |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=97 |issue=22 |pages=11899-904 |year=2000 |pmid=11050223 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/22/11899}}</ref>

==== Transition State Stabilization ====

The understanding of the origin of the reduction of ΔG<sup>‡</sup> requires one to find out how the enzymes can stabilize its transition state more than the transition state of the uncatalyzed reaction. Apparently, the most effective way for reaching large stabilization is the use of electrostatic effects, in particular, by having a relatively fixed polar environment that is oriented toward the charge distribution of the transition state.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warshel A, Sharma PK, Kato M, Xiang Y, Liu H, Olsson MH |title=Electrostatic basis for enzyme catalysis |journal=Chem. Rev. |volume=106 |issue=8 |pages=3210-35 |year=2006 |pmid=16895325}}</ref> Such an environment does not exist in the uncatalyzed reaction in water.

==== Dynamics and function ====

Recent investigations have provided new insights into the connection between internal dynamics of enzymes and their mechanism of catalysis.<ref> Eisenmesser EZ, Bosco DA, Akke M, Kern D. ''Enzyme dynamics during catalysis.'' Science. 2002 February 22;295(5559):1520–3. PMID: 11859194  </ref><ref> Agarwal PK. ''Role of protein dynamics in reaction rate enhancement by enzymes.''

''Intrinsic dynamics of an enzyme underlies catalysis.'' Nature. 2005 November 3;438(7064):117-21. PMID: 16267559</ref>
An enzyme's internal dynamics are described as the movement of internal parts (''e.g.'' amino acids, a group of amino acids, a loop region, an alpha helix, neighboring beta-sheets or even entire domain) of these biomolecules, which can occur at various time-scales ranging from [[femtoseconds]] to seconds. Networks of protein residues throughout an enzyme's structure can contribute to catalysis through dynamic motions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.structure.org/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS096921260500167X|author=Yang LW, Bahar I.|title=Coupling between catalytic site and collective dynamics: A requirement for mechanochemical activity of enzymes.| journal=Structure.|year=2005|month=June|day=5|volume=13|pages=893–904|id=PMID 15939021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/5/2794|author=Agarwal PK, Billeter SR, Rajagopalan PT, Benkovic SJ, Hammes-Schiffer S.|title=Network of coupled promoting motions in enzyme catalysis.| journal=Proc.

PMID: 15311922 </ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRP-4D4JYMC-6&_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2004&_alid=465962916&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6240&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=613585a6164baa38b4f6536d8da9170a|author=Tousignant A, Pelletier JN.|title=Protein motions promote catalysis.|journal=Chem Biol.|year=2004|month=Aug|volume=11|issue=8|pages=1037–42|id=PMID 15324804}}</ref> Protein motions are vital to many enzymes, but whether small and fast vibrations or larger and slower conformational movements are more important depends on the type of reaction involved. These new insights also have implications in understanding allosteric effects and developing new drugs.

It should be clarified, however, that the dynamical time-dependent processes are not likely to help to accelerate enzymatic reactions, since such motions randomize and the rate constant is determined by the probability (P) of reaching the transition state, (P = exp {ΔG<sup>‡</sup>/RT}).<ref> Olsson M.H.M., Parson W.W. and Warshel A. "Dynamical Contributions to Enzyme Catalysis: Critical Tests of A Popular Hypothesis" Chem. Rev., 2006 105: 1737-1756 </ref> Furthermore, the reduction of ΔG<sup>‡</sup> requires having relatively smaller motions (in relation to the corresponding motions in solution reactions) for the transition between the reactant and the product states. Thus, it is not clear that motional or dynamical effects contribute to the catalysis of the chemical step.

=== Allosteric modulation ===
[[Allosteric]] enzymes change their structure in response to binding of [[effector (biology)|effectors]]. Modulation can be direct, where the effector binds directly to [[binding site]]s in the enzyme, or indirect, where the effector binds to other proteins or [[protein subunit]]s that interact with the allosteric enzyme and thus influence catalytic activity.

== Cofactors and coenzymes ==
{{main|Cofactor (biochemistry)|Coenzyme}}
=== Cofactors ===
Some enzymes do not need any additional components to show full activity. However, others require non-protein molecules to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either [[inorganic]] (''e.g.'', metal ions and [[iron-sulfur cluster]]s) or [[organic molecules|organic compounds]], (e.g., [[flavin]] and [[heme]]). Organic cofactors (coenzymes) are usually [[prosthetic groups]], which are tightly bound to the enzymes that they assist. These tightly-bound cofactors are distinguished from other coenzymes, such as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], since they are not released from the active site during the reaction.

An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is [[carbonic anhydrase]], and is shown in the ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound in its active site.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Fisher Z, Hernandez Prada JA, Tu C, Duda D, Yoshioka C, An H, Govindasamy L, Silverman DN and McKenna R.|year= 2005|title= Structural and kinetic characterization of active-site histidine as a proton shuttle in catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase II.| journal=Biochemistry.|volume= 44(4)|pages= 1097-115|id= PMID 15667203}}</ref> These tightly-bound molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in [[redox]] reactions.

Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called '''apoenzymes'''. An apoenzyme together with its cofactor(s) is called a '''holoenzyme''' (''i.e.'', the active form). Most cofactors are not covalently attached to an enzyme, but are very tightly bound. However, organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (''e.g.'', [[thiamine pyrophosphate]] in the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]).

=== Coenzymes ===
[[دوتنه:NADH-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Molecular graphics#Space-filling models|Space-filling model]] of the coenzyme NADH]]
Coenzymes are small organic molecules that transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another.<ref>AF Wagner, KA Folkers (1975) ''Vitamins and coenzymes.'' Interscience Publishers New York| ISBN 0-88275-258-8</ref> Some of these chemicals such as [[riboflavin]], [[thiamine]] and [[folic acid]] are [[vitamins]], this is when these compounds cannot be made in the body and must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the [[hydride]] ion (H<sup>-</sup>) carried by [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD or NADP<sup>+</sup>]], the acetyl group carried by [[coenzyme A]], formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by [[folic acid]] and the methyl group carried by [[S-adenosylmethionine]]. 

Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 700 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.<ref>[http://www.brenda.uni-koeln.de/ BRENDA The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System] Accessed 04 April 2007</ref>

Coenzymes are usually regenerated and their concentrations maintained at a steady level inside the cell: for example, NADPH is regenerated through the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] and ''S''-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase.

== Thermodynamics ==
{{main |Activation energy|Thermodynamic equilibrium|Chemical equilibrium}}
[[دوتنه:Activation2 updated.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a catalytic reaction, showing the energy ''niveau'' at each stage of the reaction. The substrates usually need a large amount of energy to reach the transition state, which then decays into the end product. The enzyme stabilizes the transition state, reducing the energy needed to form this species and thus reducing the energy required to form products.]]

As all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. Usually, in the presence of an enzyme, the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly. However, in the absence of the enzyme, other possible uncatalyzed, "spontaneous" reactions might lead to different products, because in those conditions this  different product is formed faster.

Furthermore, enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavorable one. For example, the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is often used to drive other chemical reactions.

Enzymes catalyze the forward and backward reactions equally. They do not alter the equilibrium itself, but only the speed at which it is reached. For example, [[carbonic anhydrase]] catalyzes its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration of its reactants.

: <math>\mathrm{CO_2 + H_2O
{}^\mathrm{\quad Carbonic\ anhydrase}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

\overrightarrow{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}
CO_2 + H_2O}</math> (in [[lung]]s; low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration)

Nevertheless, if the equilibrium is greatly displaced in one direction, that is, in a very [[exergonic]] reaction, the reaction is ''effectively'' irreversible. Under these conditions the enzyme will, in fact, only catalyze the reaction in the thermodynamically allowed direction.

== Kinetics ==
{{main|Enzyme kinetics}}
[[دوتنه:Simple mechanism.svg|thumb|left|300px|Mechanism for a single substrate enzyme catalyzed reaction. The enzyme (E) binds a substrate (S) and produces a product (P).]]
Enzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are obtained from [[enzyme assay]]s. 

In 1902 [[Victor Henri]] <ref>{{cite journal|author=Henri, V.|year=1902|title= Theorie generale de l'action de quelques diastases|journal=Compt. rend. hebd. Acad. Sci. Paris|volume= 135|pages= 916-919}}</ref> proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, but his experimental data were not useful because the significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet appreciated. After [[Peter Lauritz Sørensen]] had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sørensen,P.L.|year=1909|title= Enzymstudien {II}. Über die Messung und Bedeutung der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration bei enzymatischen Prozessen|journal=Biochem. Z.|volume= 21|pages= 131-304}}</ref> the German chemist [[Leonor Michaelis]] and his Canadian postdoc [[Maud Leonora Menten]] repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation which is referred to as [[Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] (sometimes also [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]]).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Michaelis L., Menten M.|year=1913|title= Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung|journal=Biochem. Z.|volume= 49|pages= 333–369}} [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/menten.html English translation] Accessed 6 April 2007</ref> Their work was further developed by [[George Edward Briggs|G. E. Briggs]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]], who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.<ref> {{cite journal|url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/019/0338/bj0190338_browse.htm|author=Briggs G. E., Haldane J. B. S.|year=1925|title= A note on the kinetics of enzyme action|journal=Biochem. J.|volume=19|pages=339–339|id= PMID 16743508}}</ref>

The major contribution of Henri was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product.

[[دوتنه:Michaelis-Menten saturation curve of an enzyme reaction.svg|thumb|300px|right|Saturation curve for an enzyme reaction showing the relation between the substrate concentration (S) and rate (''v'').''']]
Enzymes can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. For example, the reaction catalyzed by [[orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase]] will consume half of its substrate in 78 million years if no enzyme is present. However, when the decarboxylase is added, the same process takes just 25 milliseconds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Radzicka A, Wolfenden R.|year= 1995|title= A proficient enzyme. |journal= Science |volume=6|issue=267|pages=90–931|id= PMID 7809611}}</ref> Enzyme rates depend on solution conditions and substrate concentration. Conditions that denature the protein abolish enzyme activity, such as high temperatures, extremes of pH or high salt concentrations, while raising substrate concentration tends to increase activity. To find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This is shown in the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES form. At the maximum velocity (''V''<sub>max</sub>) of the enzyme, all enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.  
However, ''V''<sub>max</sub> is only one kinetic constant of enzymes. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the [[Michaelis-Menten constant]] (''K''<sub>m</sub>), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum velocity. Each enzyme has a characteristic ''K''<sub>m</sub> for a given substrate, and this can show how tight the binding of the substrate is to the enzyme. Another useful constant is ''k''<sub>cat</sub>, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.

The efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of ''k''<sub>cat</sub>/''K''<sub>m</sub>. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the [[rate constant]]s for all steps in the reaction. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> (M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called ''[[catalytically perfect enzyme|catalytically perfect]]'' or ''kinetically perfect''. Example of such enzymes are [[triosephosphateisomerase|triose-phosphate isomerase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]], [[acetylcholinesterase]], [[catalase]], fumarase, β-lactamase, and [[superoxide dismutase]].

Michaelis-Menten kinetics relies on the [[law of mass action]], which is derived from the assumptions of free [[diffusion]] and thermodynamically-driven random collision.  However, many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of very high concentrations, phase-separation of the enzyme/substrate/product, or one or two-dimensional molecular movement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated |journal=Trends Biochem.

Some enzymes operate with kinetics which are faster than diffusion rates, which would seem to be impossible. Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain this phenomenon. Some proteins are believed to accelerate catalysis by drawing their substrate in and pre-orienting them by using dipolar electric fields. Other models invoke a quantum-mechanical [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] explanation, whereby a proton or an electron can tunnel through activation barriers, although for proton tunneling this model remains somewhat controversial.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Garcia-Viloca M., Gao J., Karplus M., Truhlar D.

{{main|Enzyme inhibitor}}
Enzyme reaction rates can be decreased by various types of [[enzyme inhibitor]]s.

'''Competitive inhibition'''

In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor and substrate compete for the enzyme (i.e., they can not bind at the same time). Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, [[methotrexate]] is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme [[dihydrofolate reductase]], which catalyzes the reduction of [[folic acid|dihydrofolate]] to [[folic acid|tetrahydrofolate]]. The similarity between the structures of folic acid and this drug are shown in the figure to the ''right'' bottom. Note that binding of the inhibitor need ''not'' be to the substrate binding site (as frequently stated), if binding of the inhibitor changes the conformation of the enzyme to prevent substrate binding and ''vice versa''. In competitive inhibition the maximal velocity of the reaction is not changed, but higher substrate concentrations are required to reach a given velocity, increasing the apparent K<sub>m</sub>.

'''Uncompetitive inhibition'''

In uncompetitive inhibition the inhibitor can not bind to the free enzyme, but only to the ES-complex. The EIS-complex thus formed is enzymatically inactive. This type of inhibition is rare, but may occur in multimeric enzymes. 

'''Non-competitive inhibition'''

Non-competitive inhibitors can bind to the enzyme at the same time as the substrate, i.e. they ''never'' bind to the active site. Both the EI and EIS complexes are enzymatically inactive. Because the inhibitor can not be driven from the enzyme by higher substrate concentration (in contrast to competitive inhibition), the apparent V<sub>max</sub> changes. But because the substrate can still bind to the enzyme, the K<sub>m</sub> stays the same.

'''Mixed inhibition'''

This type of inhibition resembles the non-competitive, except that the EIS-complex has residual enzymatic activity. 

In many organisms inhibitors may act as part of a [[feedback]] mechanism. If an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of [[negative feedback]]. Enzymes which are subject to this form of regulation are often multimeric and have allosteric binding sites for regulatory substances. Their substrate/velocity plots are not hyperbolar, but sigmoidal (S-shaped).

[[دوتنه:Methotrexate and folic acid compared.png||thumb|400px|right|The coenzyme folic acid (left) and the anti-cancer drug methotrexate (right) are very similar in structure. As a result, methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of many enzymes that use folates.]]

[[Enzyme inhibitor#Irreversible inhibitors|Irreversible inhibitors]] react with the enzyme and form a [[covalent bond|covalent]] adduct with the protein. The inactivation is irreversible. These compounds include [[eflornithine]] a drug used to treat the parasitic disease [[sleeping sickness]].<ref name=Poulin>Poulin R, Lu L, Ackermann B, Bey P, Pegg AE. [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/267/1/150 ''Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase by alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Characterization of sequences at the inhibitor and coenzyme binding sites.''] J Biol Chem. 1992 Jan 5;267(1):150–8. PMID 1730582</ref> [[Penicillin]] and [[Aspirin]] also act in this manner. With these drugs, the compound is bound in the active site and the enzyme then converts the inhibitor into an activated form that reacts irreversibly with one or more amino acid residues. 


=== Uses of inactivators ===

Inhibitors are often used as drugs, but they can also act as poisons. However, the difference between a drug and a poison is usually only a matter of amount, since most drugs are toxic at some level, as [[Paracelsus]] wrote, "''In all things there is a poison, and there is nothing without a poison.''"<ref>Ball, Philip (2006) ''The Devil's Doctor: Paracelsus and the World of Renaissance Magic and Science.'' Farrar, Straus and Giroux ISBN 0-374-22979-1</ref> Equally, [[antibiotics]] and other anti-infective drugs are just specific poisons that kill a pathogen but not its [[host (biology)|host]].

An example of an inactivator being used as a drug is [[aspirin]], which inhibits the [[Cyclooxygenase|COX-1]] and [[Cyclooxygenase|COX-2]] enzymes that produce the [[inflammation]] messenger [[prostaglandin]], thus suppressing pain and inflammation. The poison [[cyanide]] is an irreversible enzyme inactivator that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme [[cytochrome c oxidase]] and blocks [[cellular respiration]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/265/14/7945|author=Yoshikawa S and Caughey WS.|year=1990|month=May|volume=265|issue=14|title= Infrared evidence of cyanide binding to iron and copper sites in bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase. Implications regarding oxygen reduction.|journal= J Biol Chem.|pages= 7945–7958|id= PMID 2159465}}</ref>

== Biological function ==
Enzymes serve a wide variety of [[function (biology)|functions]] inside living organisms. They are indispensable for [[signal transduction]] and cell regulation, often via [[kinase]]s and [[phosphatase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hunter T.|year= 1995|title= Protein kinases and phosphatases: the yin and yang of protein phosphorylation and signaling.|journal= Cell.|volume= 80(2)|pages= 225–236|id= PMID 7834742}}</ref>  They also generate movement, with [[myosin]] hydrolysing ATP to generate [[muscle contraction]] and also moving cargo around the cell as part of the [[cytoskeleton]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11294886|author= Berg JS, Powell BC, Cheney RE.|year= 2001|title= A millennial myosin census.|journal= Mol Biol Cell.|volume= 12(4)|pages= 780–794|id= PMID 11294886}}</ref> Other ATPases in the cell membrane are [[Ion pump (biology)|ion pumps]] involved in [[active transport]]. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as [[luciferase]] generating light in [[Firefly|fireflies]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=2030669|author= Meighen EA.|year= 1991|title= Molecular biology of bacterial bioluminescence.|journal= Microbiol Rev.|volume= 55(1)|pages= 123–142|id= PMID 2030669}}</ref> [[Virus]]es can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the [[HIV integrase]] and [[reverse transcriptase]], or for viral release from cells, like the [[influenza]] virus [[neuraminidase]].

An  important function of enzymes is in the [[digestive systems]] of animals. Enzymes such as [[amylases]] and [[proteases]] break down large molecules ([[starch]] or [[protein]]s, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyse the starch chains into smaller molecules such as [[maltose]] and eventually [[glucose]], which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In [[ruminants]] which have a [[herbivorous]] diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, [[cellulase]] to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mackie RI, White BA |title=Recent advances in rumen microbial ecology and metabolism: potential impact on nutrient output |journal=J. Dairy Sci. |volume=73 |issue=10 |pages=2971–95 |year=1990 |pmid=2178174 |url=http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/73/10/2971}}</ref>

Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating [[metabolic pathway]]s. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyse the same reaction in parallel, this can allow more complex regulation: with for example a low constant activity being provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme. 

Enzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps, nor be fast enough to serve the needs of the cell. Indeed, a metabolic pathway such as [[glycolysis]] could not exist independently of enzymes. Glucose, for example, can react directly with ATP to become [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] at one or more of its carbons. In the absence of enzymes, this occurs so slowly as to be insignificant.  However, if [[hexokinase]] is added, these slow reactions continue to take place except that phosphorylation at carbon 6 occurs so rapidly that if the mixture is tested a short time later, [[glucose-6-phosphate]] is found to be the only significant product. Consequently, the network of metabolic pathways within each cell depends on the set of functional enzymes that are present.

== Control of activity ==

There are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell.

# '''Enzyme production''' ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] of enzyme genes) can be enhanced or diminished by a cell in response to changes in the cell's environment. This form of [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] is called [[enzyme induction and inhibition]]. For example, bacteria may become [[Antibiotic resistance|resistant to antibiotics]] such as [[penicillin]] because enzymes called [[beta-lactamase]]s are induced that hydrolyse the crucial [[Beta-lactam|beta-lactam ring]] within the penicillin molecule. Another example are enzymes in the [[liver]] called [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s, which are important in [[drug metabolism]]. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause [[drug interaction]]s.
# Enzymes can be '''compartmentalized''', with different metabolic pathways occurring in different [[cellular compartment]]s. For example, [[fatty acids]] are synthesized by one set of enzymes in the [[cytosol]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]] and used by a different set of enzymes as a source of energy in the [[mitochondrion]], through [[β-oxidation]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1218279&blobtype=pdf|author=Faergeman N. J, Knudsen J.|year= 1997|month=April|title= Role of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters in the regulation of metabolism and in cell signalling|journal= Biochem J|volume=323|pages=1–12|id= PMID 9173866}}</ref>
# Enzymes can be regulated by '''[[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] and activators'''. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called ''committed step''), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a [[negative feedback|negative feedback mechanism]], because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells. This helps allocate materials and energy economically, and prevents the manufacture of excess end products. Like other [[homeostasis|homeostatic devices]], the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.
# Enzymes can be regulated through '''[[post-translational modification]]'''. This can include [[phosphorylation]], [[Myristic acid|myristoylation]] and [[glycosylation]]. For example, in the response to [[insulin]], the [[phosphorylation]] of multiple enzymes, including [[glycogen synthase]], helps control the synthesis or degradation of [[glycogen]] and allows the cell to respond to changes in [[blood sugar]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/116/7/1175|author= Doble B. W., Woodgett J. R. |year=2003|month=April|title= GSK-3: tricks of the trade for a multi-tasking kinase|journal=J. Cell. Sci.|volume=116|pages=1175–1186|id= PMID 12615961}}</ref> Another example of post-translational modification is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. [[Chymotrypsin]], a digestive [[protease]], is produced in inactive form as [[chymotrypsinogen]] in the [[pancreas]] and transported in this form to the [[stomach]] where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme is known as a [[zymogen]].
# Some enzymes may become '''activated when localized to a different environment''' (eg. from a reducing ([[cytoplasm]]) to an oxidising ([[periplasm]]) environment, high pH to low pH etc). For example, [[hemagglutinin]] of the [[influenza]] virus undergoes a conformational change once it encounters the acidic environment of the host cell [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] causing its activation.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90260-W|author=Carr C. M., Kim P. S. |year=2003|month=April|title= A spring-loaded mechanism for the conformational change of influenza hemagglutinin|journal=Cell|volume=73|pages=823–832|id= PMID 8500173}}</ref>

== Involvement in disease ==
[[دوتنه:Phenylalanine hydroxylase brighter.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Phenylalanine hydroxylase]]. Created from [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1KW0 PDB 1KW0] ]]
Since the tight control of enzyme activity is essential for [[homeostasis]], any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme can lead to a [[genetic disease]]. The importance of enzymes is shown by the fact that a lethal illness can be caused by the malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in our bodies. 

One example is the most common type of [[phenylketonuria]]. A mutation of a single amino acid in the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]], which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of [[phenylalanine]], results in build-up of phenylalanine and related products.  This can lead to [[mental retardation]] if the disease is untreated.<ref> [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowSection&rid=gnd.section.234 Phenylketonuria: NCBI Genes and Disease] Accessed 04 April 2007</ref> 

Another example is when [[germline mutation]]s in genes coding for [[DNA repair]] enzymes cause hereditary cancer syndromes such as [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer since the body is less able to repair mutations in the genome. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the development of many types of cancer in the sufferer.

== Naming conventions ==

An enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in '''''-ase'''''. Examples are [[lactase]], [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[DNA polymerase]]. This may result in different enzymes, called isoenzymes, with the same function having the same basic name. Isoenzymes have a different amino acid sequence and might be distinguished by their optimal [[pH]], kinetic properties or immunologically. Furthermore, the normal physiological reaction an enzyme catalyzes may not be the same as under artificial conditions. This can result in the same enzyme being identified with two different names. ''E.g.'' [[Glucose isomerase]], used industrially to convert [[glucose]] into the sweetener [[fructose]], is a xylose isomerase ''in vivo''.

The [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] have developed a [[wikt:nomenclature|nomenclature]] for enzymes, the '''[[EC number]]s'''; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by "EC".
The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism:

The top-level classification is
* EC 1 ''[[Oxidoreductase]]s'': catalyze [[oxidation]]/reduction reactions
* EC 2 ''[[Transferase]]s'': transfer a [[functional group]] (''e.g.'' a methyl or phosphate group)
* EC 3 ''[[Hydrolase]]s'': catalyze the [[hydrolysis]] of various bonds
* EC 4 ''[[Lyase]]s'': cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation
* EC 5 ''[[Isomerase]]s'': catalyze [[isomer]]ization changes within a single molecule
* EC 6 ''[[Ligase]]s'': join two molecules with [[covalent bond]]s

The complete nomenclature can be browsed at http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/.

== Industrial applications ==
Enzymes are used in the [[chemical industry]] and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. However, enzymes in general are limited in the number of reactions they have evolved to catalyse and also by their lack of stability in [[organic solvent]]s and at high temperatures. Consequently, [[protein engineering]] is an active area of research and involves attempts to create new enzymes with novel properties, either through rational design or ''in vitro'' evolution.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Renugopalakrishnan V, Garduno-Juarez R, Narasimhan G, Verma CS, Wei X, Li P.|year= 2005|title= Rational design of thermally stable proteins: relevance to bionanotechnology.|journal= J Nanosci Nanotechnol.|volume=5|issue=11|pages= 1759–1767|id= PMID 16433409}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Hult K, Berglund P.|year= 2003|title= Engineered enzymes for improved organic synthesis.|journal= Curr Opin Biotechnol.|volume=14|issue=4|pages= 395–400|id= PMID 12943848}}</ref>
