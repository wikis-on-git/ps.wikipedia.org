'''Slovenia''', officially the '''Republic of Slovenia''' ([[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]: ''Republika Slovenija''), is a coastal [[Alpine countries|Alpine country]] in southern [[Central Europe]] bordering [[اټاليا]] to the west, the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the southwest, [[کروآسيا]] to the south and east, [[هنګري]] to the northeast, and [[اطريش]] to the north. 

Throughout Slovenia's history, the country has been part of the [[Roman Empire]], the Duchy of [[Karantania|Carantania]] (only Slovenia's modern northern part), the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1929) [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]], and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR of Yugoslavia]] from 1945 until gaining independence in 1991. Slovenia became a member of the [[European Union]] on [[1 May]] [[2004]]. Slovenia is also a member of the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], and has observer status in [[La Francophonie]].

== تاريخ ==
{{main|History of Slovenia}}
[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ancestors of the present-day [[Slovenians]] settled in the area in the [[6th century]]. The Slavic Duchy of [[Karantania|Carantania]] was formed in the [[7th century]]. In [[745]], Carantania lost its independence, being largely subsumed into the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[empire]]. Many [[Slavs]] [[christianization|converted to Christianity]].

The [[Freising manuscripts]], the earliest surviving written documents in a Slovenian dialect and the first ever Slavic document in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script, were written around [[1000]] AD. During the [[14th century]], most of Slovenia's regions passed into ownership of the [[Habsburg]]s whose lands later formed the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], with Slovenians inhabiting all or most of the provinces of [[Carniola]], [[Gorizia]] and [[Gradisca]], and parts of the provinces of [[Istria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]].

In [[1848]] a strong programme for a [[United Slovenia]] (''Zedinjena Slovenija'') emerged as part of the [[Spring of Nations]] movement within Austria.

With the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] monarchy in [[1918]], Slovenians initially formed part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which shortly joined the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later renamed (1929) the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Following the re-establishment of Yugoslavia at the end of [[World War II]], Slovenia became a part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], officially declared on [[29 November]] [[1945]]. Present-day Slovenia was formed on [[25 June]] [[1991]] upon its independence from Yugoslavia, defeating the Yugoslav Army in the [[Ten-Day War]]. Slovenia joined [[NATO]] on [[29 March]] [[2004]] and the [[European Union]] on [[1 May]] [[2004]]. Slovenia will hold the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in the first half of 2008, being the first "new" member state to do so.

The Slovenian [[head of state]] is the [[president of Slovenia|president]], who is elected by popular vote every 5 years. The [[executive branch]] is headed by the [[prime minister]] and the council of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] or [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], which are elected by the [[parliament]].

The [[bicameral]] Slovenian [[parliament]] consists of the National Assembly or [[Državni zbor]], and the Državni svet or National Council. The National Assembly has 90 seats, which are partially filled with directly elected representatives, and partially with proportionally elected representatives (two seats reserved for autochthonous Hungarian and Italian minorities). The National Council has 40 seats, and is made up of representatives of social, economic, professional and local interest groups. Parliamentary elections are held every four years.

=== Traditional Regions ===
[[دوتنه:Slo regions marked3.png|thumb|right|250px|Slovenia is traditionally divided into eight regions.]]
As given by [[Enciklopedija Slovenije]] (Encyclopedia of Slovenia), traditional Slovenian [[region]]s, based on the former division of Slovenia into four [[Habsburg]] [[crown land]]s ([[Carniola]], [[Carinthia]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], and the [[Slovenian Littoral|Littoral]]) and their parts, are:

* [[Upper Carniola]] (''Gorenjska'') (denoted on the map by U.C.)
* [[Lower Styria|Styria]] (''Štajerska'') (S)
* [[Prekmurje]] (T)
* [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]] (''Koroška'') (C)
* [[Inner Carniola]] (''Notranjska'') (I.C.)
* [[Lower Carniola]] (''Dolenjska'') (L.C.)
* [[Goriška]] (G)
* [[Istria|Slovenian Istria]] (''Slovenska Istra'') (L)

The last two are usually considered together as the [[Slovenian Littoral|Littoral Region]] (''Primorska''). [[White Carniola]] (''Bela krajina''), otherwise part of Lower Carniola, is usually considered a separate region, as is [[Zasavje]], which is otherwise a part of Upper and Lower Carniola and Styria.

{{legend|#A6D4CA|Panonnian landscape}} 
{{legend|#FAC1B8|Dinaric landscape}}
{{legend|#A7B4D6|Mediterranean landscape}}]]
The first regionalizations of Slovenia were made by geographers [[Anton Melik]] (1935-1936) and [[Svetozar Ilešič]] (1968). The newer regionalization by [[Ivan Gams]] divides Slovenia in the following macroregions:
* the [[Alps]] (visokogorske Alpe) 
* the Prealpine Hills (predalpsko hribovje)
* the [[Ljubljana basin]] (Ljubljanska kotlina)
* Submediterranean ([[Littoral]]) Slovenia (submediteranska - primorska Slovenija)
* the [[Dinaric Alps|dinaric]] [[Karst]] of inner Slovenia (dinarski kras notranje Slovenije)
* Subpannonian Slovenia (subpanononska Slovenija)

According to a newer natural geographic regionalization, the country consists of four [[macroregion]]s. These are the Alpine world, the Mediterranean world, the Dinaric world and the Pannonian world. Macroregions are defined according to major relief units (the Alps, the Pannonian plain, the Dinaric mountains) and climate types (continental, alpine, mediterranean). These are often quite interwoven.

Macroregions consist of multiple and very diverse [[mesoregion]]s. The main factor that defines them is the relief together with the geologic composition. Mesoregions in turn consist of numerous [[microregion]]s.

=== Statistical Regions ===
As of May 2005, only statistical regions exist legally, and, as their name suggests, are only used for [[Statistics|statistical]] purposes. There are 12 of these regions. 

[[دوتنه:Slovenia Regions.png|thumb|right|400px|Map of the 12 statistical regions of Slovenia.]]

The statistical regions are:
<table><td><ol>

<li> {{legend|#B3D9D9|'''Zasavska'''}}
</td></ol></table>

The [[Government]], however, is preparing a plan for new administrative regions. The number of these regions is not yet defined, but is said to be around 12 to 14. The plan will, after being publicly unveiled, need to undergo parliamentary debate. [[Constitution]] changes allowing the creation of regions have already been approved by the National Assembly. If the scenario of 12 administrative regions is selected, the regions will most likely be the same as the current Statistical regions.

=== Municipalities ===
{{main|Municipalities of Slovenia}}

Slovenia is divided into 210 municipalities (''občine'', singular - ''občina''), of which 11 have urban status.

== جغرافيه ==
{{main|Geography of Slovenia}}
[[دوتنه:Slovenia-map-CIA.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of Slovenia]]
[[دوتنه:Triglav.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Triglav]]]]
Four major European geographic regions meet in Slovenia: the [[Alps]], the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], the [[Pannonian plain]], and the [[Mediterranean]]. Slovenia's highest peak is [[Triglav]] (2,864&nbsp;m; 9,396&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]); the country's average height above the sea level is 557 metres (1,827&nbsp;ft). Around one half of the country (10,124&nbsp;km²; 3,909&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) is covered by [[forest]]s; this makes Slovenia the third most forested country in Europe, after [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. Remnants of primeval forests are still to be found, the largest in the [[Kočevje]] area. Grassland covers 5,593 square kilometres (2,159&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of the country and fields and gardens 2,471 square kilometres (838&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). There are also 363 square kilometres (140&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of orchards and 216 square kilometres (83&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of [[vineyard]]s.

Its [[climate]] is Submediterranean on the coast, Alpine in the mountains and continental with mild to hot summers and cold winters in the plateaus and valleys to the east. The average temperatures are -2°[[Celsius|C]] (28°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in January and 21&nbsp;°C (70&nbsp;°F) in July. The average rainfall is 1,000 millimetres (39.4&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) for the coast, up to 3,500 millimetres (138&nbsp;in) for the Alps, 800 millimetres (31.5&nbsp;in) for south east and 1,400 millimetres (55&nbsp;in)for central Slovenia.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Slovenia}}

Slovenia is a high-income economy which enjoys the highest [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita ($23,250 in 2006 <ref>{{en icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2006&ED=2006&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=941-914-946-137-962-122-181-124-963-138-918-964-182-968-960-423-935-128-965-936-961-939-184-172-132-134-174-144-944-186-178-136-112&S=PPPPC&CMP=0&x=49&y=15 | title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects | publisher=International Monetary Fund | accessdate=2006-04-06}}</ref>) of the newly joined EU countries. The country's relatively high rate of [[inflation]] (3.6% in 2004) declined to 2.5% in 2005 and is now comparable to the average in the [[European Union]]. Slovenia's economy has started to [[Economic growth|grow]] more strongly in the last few years (5.1% in Q1 2006, 3.9% in 2005, 4.2% in 2004), after relatively slow growth in 2003 (2.7%). Overall, the country is on a sound economic footing. 

During 2000, privatisations were seen in the [[banking]], [[telecommunications]], and public utility sectors. Restrictions on foreign [[investment]] are slowly being dismantled, and [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) is expected to increase over the next few years. Slovenia is the economic front-runner of the countries that joined the European Union in 2004 and is the first "new" member which will adopt the [[euro]] as the country's only currency on [[1 January]] [[2007]]. Moreover, Slovenia will be the first new member state to hold the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in the first half of 2008.

}}{{main|Demographics of Slovenia}}
Slovenia's main ethnic group is [[Slovenians]] (83%). Nationalities from the [[former Yugoslavia]] ([[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]] & [[Muslims by nationality]]) form 6.3% and the [[Magyars|Hungarian]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Roma people|Roma]] minorities 0.6% of the population. Ethnic affiliation of 8.9% was either undeclared or unknown. Life expectancy in 2003 was 72.2 years for men and 80 years for women.

With 99 inhabitants per square kilometre (256/sq&nbsp;mi), Slovenia ranks low among the European countries in population density (compare with 320/km² (829/sq&nbsp;mi) for the [[Netherlands]] or 195/km² (505/sq&nbsp;mi) for [[Italy]]). The Notranjsko-kraška region has the lowest population density while the Osrednjeslovenska region has the highest. Approximately 51% of the population lives in urban areas and 49% in rural areas.

The official language is [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], which is a member of the [[South Slavic languages|South]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic language group]]. [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] enjoy the status of official languages in the ethnically mixed regions along the Hungarian and Italian border.

By religion, Slovenians have traditionally been largely [[Roman Catholic]]. The pre-[[1945]], pre-[[socialist]]s' rule, percentage is estimated at as high as 88%, while by 1991 this had already dropped to 71.6%, and the number of followers is still falling (57.8% in 2002).

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Slovenia}}

Slovenia's first book was printed by the Protestant reformer [[Primož Trubar]] (1508-1586). It was actually two books, ''Catechismus'' (a [[catechism]]) and [[Abecedarium (Trubar)|Abecedarium]], which was published in 1550 in [[Tübingen]], [[Germany]].

The central part of the country, namely [[Carniola]] (which existed as a part of [[Austria-Hungary]] until the early [[20th century]]) was ethnographically and historically well described in the book [[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]] ([[German language|German]] ''Die Ehre deß Herzogthums Crain'', [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''Slava vojvodine Kranjske''), published in 1689 by [[baron]] [[Janez Vajkard Valvasor]] (1641-1693).

Slovenia's two greatest writers were the poet [[France Prešeren]] (1800-1849) and writer [[Ivan Cankar]] (1876-1918). The most important Slovenian painters are [[Ivana Kobilca]] and [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[Rihard Jakopič]]. The most famed Slovenian architect is [[Jože Plečnik]] who worked in [[Vienna]] as well as in [[Prague]].

Slovenia is a homeland of numerous musicians and composers, including [[Renaissance]] composer [[Jacobus Gallus]] (1550-1591), who greatly influenced Central European classical music. In the 20th century, [[Bojan Adamič]] was a renowned film music composer.

Contemporary popular musicians have been [[Slavko Avsenik]], [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]], [[Vlado Kreslin]], [[Zoran Predin]], [[Pero Lovšin]], [[New Swing Quartet]], [[DJ Umek]], [[Siddharta (band)|Siddharta]], [[Magnifico]], recently also [[Atomik Harmonik]] and others.

Slovenian cinema has more than a century-long tradition with [[Karol Grossmann]], [[Janko Ravnik]], [[Ferdo Delak]], France Štiglic, [[Mirko Grobler]], [[Igor Pretnar]], France Kosmač, Jože Pogačnik, Matjaž Klopčič, Jane Kavčič, [[Jože Gale]], Boštjan Hladnik and [[Karpo Godina]] as its most established filmmakers. Contemporary film directors [[Janez Burger]], Jan Cvitkovič, [[Damjan Kozole]], [[Janez Lapajne]] and [[Maja Weiss]] are most notable representatives of the so-called ''renaissance of Slovenian cinema''.

Slovenia's learned men include [[chemist]] and Nobel prize laureate [[Friderik Pregl]], [[physicist]] [[Joseph Stefan|Jožef Stefan]], [[philosopher]] [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[linguist]] [[Franc Miklošič]], physician [[Anton Marko Plenčič]], [[mathematician]] [[Jurij Vega]].

== Biodiversity ==
{{copyedit}}
[[دوتنه:Lipizzaner PRMO.jpg|thumb|250px|Lipizzaner ([[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''Lipicanec'')]]
Although Slovenia is a small country, there is an exceptionally wide variety of habitats. In the north of Slovenia are located the [[Alps]] (namely, [[Julian Alps]], [[Karavanke]], [[Kamnik Alps]]), and in the south stand the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]]. There is also a small area of the Pannonian plain and a [[Littoral Region]]. Slovenia also contains a [[Karst]] - a very rich, often unexplored underground habitat containing a diverse [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] (the word "karst" itself derives from the Slovenian region of [[Kras]]). 

Half of the country (53%) is covered by [[forests]]. These forests are an important natural resource, but their true value lies in the preservation of natural diversity. Further value lies in their ecological (protection of the soil, water and air) and social value (tourism and recreation). They lend as well their natural beauty to the Slovenian landscape. In the interior of the country there are typical [[Central Europe]]an forests, the predominant trees being ([[oak]]s and [[beech]]es. In the mountains [[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[pine]] are more common. The [[tree-line]] is at 1,700-1,800 metres (5,575–5,900&nbsp;ft). 

Pinetrees also grow on the [[Karst]] [[plateau]]. Only one third of [[Kras]] (Karst) is now covered by pine forest. It is said that most was chopped down long ago to provide the wooden pylons on which the city of Venice now stands. The [[Karst]] and [[White Carniola]] are well known for the mysterious [[olm|proteus]]. The [[tilia|lime (linden)]] tree, also common in Slovenian forests, is a national symbol. A national proverb says, "A true Slovenian must raise a child, write a book and plant a tree."

In the Alps there are flowers of great beauty such as ''[[Daphne blagayana]]'', various [[gentian]]s (''[[Gentiana clusii]]'', ''[[Gentiana froelichi]]''), ''[[Primula auricula]]'', [[Leontopodium alpinum|Edelweiss]] (the symbol of Slovenian mountaineering), ''[[Cypripedium calceolus]]'', ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'' (Snakes's head), and ''[[Pulsatilla grandis]]''. 

Fauna includes [[marmot]]s (introduced), [[Alpine Ibex|steinbocks]], and [[chamois]]. There are numerous [[deer]], [[roe deer]], [[boar]]s and [[hare]]s. The [[loir]] or [[dormouse|fat dormouse]] is often found in the Slovenian beech forests. Hunting these animals is a long tradition and is well described in the book [[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]] (''Slava vojvodine Kranjske'') (1689), written by [[Janez Vajkard Valvasor]] (1641-1693). Some important carnivores include the [[Eurasian lynx]] (reintroduced to [[Kočevje]] area in 1973), European [[wild cat]], [[fox]] (especially the [[red fox]]), and the rare [[jackal]] <ref>{{sl icon}} {{cite web| url=http://www.gea-on.net/clanek.asp?ID=608 | title="Šakali"| author=Maja Berden Zrimec | year=2005 | month=May | publisher=[[GEA (journal)]] | accessdate=2006-04-06}}</ref>. There also exist [[hedgehog]]s, [[marten]]s, snakes ([[viper]]s, [[grass snake]]s, etc.). As of March 2005, Slovenia also has a limited population of wolves and about 400 [[brown bear]]s.

There is a wide variety of birds, such as the [[tawny owl]], [[long-eared owl]] and [[Eagle Owl]], [[hawk]]s and [[Short-toed Eagle]]s. Various other birds of prey have been recorded, as well as a growing number of [[raven]]s, [[crow]]s and [[magpie]]s migrating into Ljubljana and Maribor where they thrive. Other birds include the [[woodpecker]] (black and green woodpecker) and the [[white stork]] which nests in [[Prekmurje]]. 

The indigenous Slovenian fish is the [[Marmorata]]. Extensive breeding programs have been introduced to repopulate the Marmorata into lakes and streams invaded by non-indigenous species of [[trout]]. The only regular species of [[cetacea]]ns found in the northern Adriatic sea is the [[Bottlenose Dolphin]] (''Tursiops truncatus'') <ref>{{en icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.morigenos.org/dolphins_slovenia.htm | title=Dolphins in Slovenia | publisher=Morigenos | accessdate=2006-04-06}}</ref>.

Domestic animals originating in Slovenia include the [[Carniolan honeybee]], the indigenous [[Karst Sheepdog]] and the [[Lipizzan]] horse. The exploration of various cave systems has yielded discoveries of many cave-dwelling insects and other organisms.

Slovenia is a veritable cornucopia of forest, cavern and mountain-dwelling wildlife. Many species that are endangered or have even become extinct in other parts of Europe, can still be found there.
