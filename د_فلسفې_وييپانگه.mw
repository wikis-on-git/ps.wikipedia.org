{{Glossary}}

{{Term|term= Absolutism |content= [[Universality (philosophy)#As a state (truth)|Absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= the position that in a particular domain of thought, all statements in that domain are either absolutely true or absolutely false: none is true for some cultures or eras while false for other cultures or eras. These statements are called absolute truths. A common reaction by those who newly criticize absolutism is the absolute truth statement: Absolute truths do not exist. }}
*{{Term|term= Enlightened absolutism |content= [[Enlightened absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of governing by rulers who were influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (18th-century and early 19th-century Europe). }}
*{{Term|term= Moral absolutism |content= [[Moral absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= the position that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged, and that certain actions are right or wrong, regardless of the context of the act. }}
*{{Term|term= Political absolutism |content= [[Political absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= a political theory that argues that one person should hold all power. }}
{{Term|term= Absurdism |content= [[Absurdism]] }}{{defn|1= [[philosophy]] stating that the efforts of man to find meaning in the [[universe]] will ultimately fail because no such meaning exists (at least in relation to man). Absurdism is related to [[existentialism]], though should not be confused with it, nor [[nihilism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Accidentalism |content= [[Tychism|Accidentalism]] }}{{defn|1= any system of thought that denies the causal nexus and maintains that events succeed one another haphazardly or by chance (not in the mathematical but in the popular sense). In [[metaphysics]], accidentalism denies the doctrine that everything occurs or results from a definite cause. In this connection it is synonymous with [[tychism]] (ruxi, chance), a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for the theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe.}}
{{Term|term= Acosmism |content= [[Acosmism]] }}{{defn|1= in contrast to [[pantheism]], denies the reality of the [[universe]], seeing it as ultimately illusory, (the prefix "a-" in Greek meaning negation; like "un-" in English), and only the infinite Unmanifest Absolute as real. This [[philosophy]] begins with the recognition that there is only one Reality, which is infinite, non-dual, blissful, etc. Yet the phenomenal reality of which we are normally aware is none of these things; it is in fact just the opposite—i.e., dualistic, finite, full of suffering and pain, and so on. And since the Absolute is the only reality, that means that everything that is not-Absolute cannot be real. Thus, according to this viewpoint, the phenomenal dualistic world is ultimately an illusion ("Maya" to use the technical Indian term), irrespective of the apparent reality it possesses at the mundane or empirical level.}}
{{Term|term= ad hoc | content = [[ad hoc]] }}{{defn|no=1 |defn= on the spur of the moment}}{{defn|no=2 |defn= not following a general rule, a solution for a particular purpose.}}
{{Term|term= ad hominem | content = [[ad hominem]] }}{{defn|1= an argument attacking one's opponent personally instead of attacking his or her arguments, premises, and logic}}
{{Term|term= Aestheticism |content= [[Aestheticism]] }}{{defn|1= another name for the ''Aesthetic movement'', a loosely defined movement in [[art]] and [[literature]] in later 19th century [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Proponents of the movement held that art does not have any didactic purpose, it need only be beautiful. Life should copy Art. The main characteristics of the movement were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, massive use of symbols, and synaesthetic effects - that is, correspondence between words, colors and music.}}
{{Term|term= Agnosticism |content= [[Agnosticism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that the truth values of certain claims — particularly [[theology|theological]] claims regarding the existence of [[monotheism|God]], [[polytheism|gods]], or [[deity|deities]] — are unknown, inherently unknowable, or incoherent, and therefore, (some agnostics may go as far to say) irrelevant to [[Meaning of life|life]]. Agnosticism, in both its strong (explicit) and weak (implicit) forms, is necessarily a non-atheist and non-theist position, though an agnostic person may also be either an atheist, a theist, or one who endorses neither position. }}
*{{Term|term= Agnostic atheism |content= [[Agnostic atheism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical view that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Due to definitional variance, an ''agnostic atheist'' does not believe in [[God]] or gods and by extension holds true: 'the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable', or 'knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant', or 'abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal'. }}
*{{Term|term= Agnostic theism |content= [[Agnostic theism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. An agnostic theist is one who views that the truth value of claims regarding the existence of god(s) is unknown or inherently unknowable but chooses to believe in god(s) in spite of this.  }}
*{{Term|term= Strong agnosticism |content= [[Strong agnosticism]] }}{{defn|1= also referred to as ''explicit agnosticism'' and ''positive agnosticism'', it is the view that the evidence in the universe is such that it is impossible for humans to [[knowledge|know]] whether or not any [[deity|deities]] exist. }}
*{{Term|term= Weak agnosticism |content= [[Weak agnosticism]] }}{{defn|1= the position that the evidence is such that the existence or nonexistence of [[deity|deities]] is currently [[knowledge|unknown]], but is not necessarily unknowable. Also called ''implicit agnosticism'', ''empirical agnosticism'', and ''negative agnosticism''. }}
{{Term|term= Altruism |content= [[Altruism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that people have a moral obligation to serve others or the "greater good"; term coined by [[Auguste Comte]]. Generally opposed to ''self-interest'' or ''egoism''. }}
{{Term|term= Anarchism |content= [[Anarchism]] }}{{defn|1= in politics, any of a number of views and movements that advocate the elimination of rulership or government. Other than being opposed to the state, there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold. Compare and contrast [[libertarianism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Anarcho-primitivism |content= [[Anarcho-primitivism]] }}{{defn|1= an [[anarchism|anarchist]] critique of the origins and progress of [[civilization]]. Primitivists argue that the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. They advocate a return to non-"civilized" ways of life through [[industrialisation|deindustrialisation]], abolition of [[division of labour]] or [[specialization (functional)|specialization]], and abandonment of [[technology]]. }}
{{Term|term= Anarcho-syndicalism |content= [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of anarchism that allies itself with [[syndicalism]], that is, with [[labor union]]s, as a force for revolutionary social change. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to replace capitalism and the state with a democratically worker-managed means of production. They seek to abolish the wage system and most forms of private property. }}
{{Term|term= Animism |content= [[Animism]] }}{{defn|1= "animism" has been applied to many different philosophical systems.  This includes [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[stoics]] and [[scholastics]]. On the other hand, [[monadology]] ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) has also been described as animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that life is not merely mechanical but that there is a directive force that guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the ''world soul'', held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and others. Lastly, in discussions of religion, "animism" refers to the belief in indwelling souls or spirits, particularly so-called "primitive" religions that consider everything inhabited by spirits. }}
{{Term|term= Anthropocentrism |content= [[Anthropocentrism]] }}{{defn|1= also called '''Homocentrism''', is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of regarding the existence and/or concerns of [[human being]]s as the central fact of the [[universe]]. This is similar, but not identical, to the practice of relating all that happens in the universe to the human experience. To clarify, the first position concludes that the fact of human existence is the point of universal existence; the latter merely compares all activity to that of humanity, without making any [[teleology|teleological]] conclusions. }}
{{Term|term= Anthropomorphism |content= [[Anthropomorphism]]<ref name="Oxford">Blackburn, Simon. ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', Oxford University Press, 1994. This dictionary includes an entry for this word.</ref> }}{{defn|1= a form of [[personification]] (applying human or animal qualities to inanimate objects) and similar to '''prosopopoeia''' (adopting the persona of another person), is the attribution of human characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, or natural phenomena. [[Animal]]s, forces of [[nature]], and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. Two examples are the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally to God (or the gods), and creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as Death, Lust, War, or the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]. }}
{{Term|term= Antinomianism |content= [[Antinomianism]] }}{{defn|1= in [[theology]] is the idea that members of a particular religious group are under no obligation to obey the [[religious law|laws]] of [[ethics]] or [[morality]] as presented by religious authorities. Antinomianism is the polar opposite of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]], the notion that obedience to a code of religious law is necessary for [[salvation]]. The term has become a point of contention among opposed religious authorities. Few groups or sects explicitly call themselves "antinomian", but the charge is often levelled by some sects against competing sects. }}
{{Term|term= Anti-realism |content= [[Anti-realism]] }}{{defn|1= any position involving either the denial of the objective reality of entities of a certain type or the insistence that we should be [[agnosticism|agnostic]] about their real existence. Thus, we may speak of '''anti-realism''' with respect to other minds, the past, the future, [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the material world, or even thought. }}
{{Term|term= Aristotelianism |content= [[Aristotelianism]] }}{{defn|1= tradition of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. Sometimes contrasted by critics with the rationalism and idealism of [[Plato]], Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories. Most particularly, Aristotelianism brings Plato's ideals down to Earth as goals and goods internal to natural species that are realized in activity. This is the characteristically Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Neo-Aristotelianism |content= [[Neo-Aristotelianism]] }}{{defn|1= A view of literature and criticism propagated by the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] -- [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others that means "A view of literature and criticism that takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically." }}
{{Term|term= Arminianism |content= [[Arminianism]] }}{{defn|1= a school of [[soteriology|soteriological]] thought in [[Protestant]] [[Christian theology]] founded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Arminianism is closely related to [[Calvinism]] (or Reformed theology), and the two systems share both history and many doctrines in common. }}
{{Term|term= Asceticism |content= [[Asceticism]] }}{{defn|1= denotes a life characterised by refraining from worldly pleasures ([[austerity]]). Those who practice ascetic lifestyles often perceive their practices as [[virtue|virtuous]] and pursue them to achieve greater [[spirituality]]. In a more cynical context, ascetic may connote some form of self-mortification, ritual punishment of the body or harsh renunciation of pleasure. However, the word certainly does not necessarily imply a negative connotation. }}
{{Term|term= Ascriptivism |content= [[Ascriptivism]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ismbook.com/ascriptivism.html |title=ascriptivism |publisher=Ismbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> }}{{defn|1= "The view that human beings are to be held responsible for their actions even if determinism is true." }}
{{Term|term= Associationalism |content= [[Associationalism]] }}{{defn|1= a political project where "human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations".<ref name="Hirst112">Smith, M. K.; ''[http://www.infed.org/association/b-assoc.htm association, la vie associative and lifelong learning]'' cites Hirst, P. [[#References|References]] page 112.</ref> Associationalism "gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows"<ref name="Hirst112"/> }}
{{Term|term= Atheism |content= [[Atheism]] }}{{defn|1= a condition of being without theistic beliefs; an absence of belief in the existence of [[deity|gods]], thus contrasting with [[theism]]. This definition includes both those who assert that there are no gods and those who have no beliefs at all regarding the existence of gods. However, narrower definitions often only qualify the former as atheism, the latter falling under the more general (but rarely used) term [[nontheism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Agnostic atheism |content= [[Agnostic atheism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophy that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Due to definitional variance, an ''agnostic atheist'' does not believe in [[God]] or gods and by extension holds true: 'the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable', or 'knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant', or 'abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal'. }}
*{{Term|term= Strong atheism |content= [[Strong atheism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical position that [[deity|deities]] do not exist. It is a form of [[Atheism#Implicit and explicit atheism|explicit atheism]], meaning that it consciously rejects [[theism]]. Some strong atheists also claim that the existence of any and all gods is logically impossible. Also called ''positive atheism'', ''hard atheism'' and ''gnostic atheism''. It should be noted that a strong atheist also fits the definition of a weak atheist, but that the reverse is not necessarily true: a strong atheist believes there is a lack or absence of evidence for justifying a belief in God or gods, but a weak atheist does not necessarily deny the possibility of God or god(s) existence. }}
*{{Term|term= Weak atheism |content= [[Weak atheism]] }}{{defn|1= disbelief in the [[existence]] of [[God]] or [[deity|gods]], without a commitment to the necessary non-existence of God or gods. Also referred to as ''negative atheism'' or ''implicit atheism.'' The weak atheist generally gives a broad definition of [[atheism]] as a lack or absence of evidence justifying a belief in God or gods, which defines atheism as a range of positions that [[logical consequence|entail]] non-belief, unjustified belief, [[doubt]], or denial of theism. }}
{{Term|term= Atomism |content= [[Atomism]] }}{{defn|1= the theory that all the objects in the universe are composed of very small, [[Eternity|indestructible]] elements. (This is the case for the Western [i.e., Greek] theories of atomism. Buddhists also have well-developed theories of atomism, which involve momentary, or non-eternal, atoms, that flash in and out of existence). }}
*{{Term|term= Social atomism |content= [[Atomism (social)|Social atomism]] }}{{defn|1= the point-of-view that individuals rather than social institutions and values are the proper subject of analysis since all properties of institutions and values merely accumulate from the strivings of individuals. }}
*{{Term|term= Logical atomism |content= [[Atomism (logical)|Logical atomism]] }}{{defn|1= [[Bertrand Russell]] developed [[atomism (logical)|''logical atomism'']] in an attempt to identify the atoms of thought, the pieces of thought that cannot be divided into smaller pieces of thought. }}
{{Term|term= Authoritarianism |content= [[Authoritarianism]] }}{{defn|1=an [[organization]] or a [[State (polity)|state]] that enforces strong, and sometimes oppressive measures against those in its sphere of influence, generally without attempts at gaining their consent and often not allowing feedback on its policies. In an authoritarian state, citizens are subject to state authority in many aspects of their lives, including many that other [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] would see as matters of personal choice. There are various degrees of authoritarianism; even very democratic and liberal states will show authoritarianism to some extent, for example in areas of national security. }}
{{Term|term= Automatism |content= [[Surrealist automatism|Automatism]] or Surrealist automatism }}{{defn|1= an artistic technique of spontaneous writing, drawing, or the like practiced without conscious aesthetic or moral self-censorship. }}

{{Term|term= Behavioralism |content= [[Behavioralism]] }}{{defn|1= (not to be confused with [[behaviorism]] of [[psychology]]) is an approach in [[political science]] that seeks to provide an objective, quantified approach to explaining and predicting political behavior. It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the natural sciences. }}
{{Term|term= Behaviorism |content= [[Behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= (not to be confused with [[behavioralism]] of [[political science]]) is an approach to [[psychology]] based on the proposition that behavior can be researched [[Scientific method|scientifically]] without recourse to inner mental states. It is a form of [[materialism]], denying any independent significance for the mind. Its significance for psychological treatment has been profound, making it one of the pillars of [[pharmacological]] therapy. }}
*{{Term|term= Classical behaviorism |content= [[Classical behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= The behaviorism of Watson; the objective study of behavior; no mental life, no internal states; thought is [[covert]] speech. }}
*{{Term|term= Methodological behaviorism |content= [[Methodological behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= The objective study of third-person behavior; the data of psychology must be inter-subjectively verifiable; no [[theoretical]] prescriptions. It has been absorbed into general experimental and [[cognitive psychology]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Radical behaviorism |content= [[Radical behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Skinner's behaviorism; is considered radical since it expands behavioral principles to processes within the organism; in contrast to methodological behaviorism; not mechanistic or reductionist; hypothetical (mentalistic) internal states are not considered causes of behavior, phenomena must be observable at least to the individual experiencing them. [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] made use of many of radical behaviorism ideas in his study of knowing and language. }}
*{{Term|term= Logical behaviorism |content= [[Logical behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Established by Oxford philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]] in his book The Concept of Mind (1949). }}
*{{Term|term= Teleological behaviorism |content= [[Teleological behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Post-Skinnerian, purposive, close to [[microeconomics]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Theoretical behaviorism |content= [[Theoretical behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Post-Skinnerian, accepts observable internal states ("within the skin" once meant "unobservable", but with modern technology we are not so constrained); dynamic, but [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] in choice of theoretical structures, emphasizes [[parsimony]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Biological behaviorism |content= [[Biological behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Post-Skinnerian, centered on perceptual and motor modules of behavior, theory of behavior systems. }}
*{{Term|term= Inter behaviorism |content= [[Inter behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Founded by [[Jacob Robert Kantor]] before Skinner's writings and currently worked by L. Hayes; E. Ribes; and S. Bijou. centered in the inter behavior of organisms, field theory of behavior; emphasis on human behavior. }}
{{Term|term= Biologism |content= [[Biologism]] }}{{defn|1= (biological determination) the interpretation of humans and human life from a strictly biological point of view, and it is closely related to genetic determinism }}
{{Term|term= Buddhism |content= [[Buddhism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[dharmic religion]] and [[philosophy]] based on the teachings of the Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]]. The basic teachings of Buddhism have to do with the nature of suffering or dissatisfaction (''dukkha'') and its avoidance through ethical principles (the Eightfold Path). Buddhism originated in [[India]], and is today largely followed in East Asia, including [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Tibet]], and [[Thailand]]. Buddhism is divided into different sects and movements, of which the largest are the [[Mahayana]], [[Theravada]], and [[Vajrayana]]. }}

{{Term|term= Capitalism |content= [[Capitalism]]<ref name="Oxford"/> }}{{defn|1= an [[economic system]] in which all or most of the [[means of production]] are [[private property|privately owned]] and [[management|operated]] (usually through [[employment|employing]] [[wage]] [[labour (economics)|labour]], and for [[Profit (economics)|profit]]), and in which the [[investment]] of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[logistics|distribution]] and [[price]]s of [[commodities]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are determined mainly in a [[free market]]. Capitalism has also been called ''[[laissez-faire]] economy'', ''[[free market]] economy'', ''free enterprise system'', ''[[economic liberalism]]'', and ''economic individualism''. }}
*{{Term|term= Anarcho-capitalism |content= [[Anarcho-capitalism]] }}{{defn|1= a philosophy based on the idea of [[individual sovereignty]], and a prohibition against initiatory [[coercion]] and [[fraud]]. It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals. From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] as an unjustified monopolist and aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through [[taxation]], with private, competing businesses. }}
{{Term|term= Careerism |content= [[Careerism]] }}{{defn|1= the desire to advance one's own [[career]] as a sole aim in life, often at the expense of personal and social growth or development. }}
{{Term|term= Cartesianism |content= [[Cartesianism]] }}{{defn|1= a philosophy based on the ideas and works of [[René Descartes]]. }}
{{Term|term= Christianism |content= [[Christianity|Christianism]] }}{{defn|1= another name for ''Christianity'', the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion recognizing [[Jesus Christ]] as its founder and central figure. With more than two billion adherents, or about one-third of the total world population, it is the largest world religion. Its origins are intertwined with [[Judaism]], with which it shares much sacred lore, including the [[Old Testament]] (Hebrew Bible). Christianity is sometimes termed an [[Abrahamic religion]], along with [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. }}
{{Term|term= Classicism |content= [[Classicism]] }}{{defn|1= in the [[arts]], refers generally to a high regard for [[classical antiquity]], as setting standards for taste that the classicist seeks to emulate. Classicism is usually contrasted with [[romanticism]]; the art of classicism typically seeks to be formal, restrained, and [[Apollo]]nian (nothing in excess) rather than [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] (excess), in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s opposition. It can also refer to the other periods of classicism. In [[theater]], '''Classicism''' was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theater]], including the [[Classical unities]] of time, place and action. }}
{{Term|term= Cognitivism |content= [[Cognitivism (ethics)|Cognitivism]] }}{{defn|1= In [[ethics]], cognitivism is the philosophical view that ethical sentences express propositions, and hence are capable of being true or false. See [[Cognitivism (ethics)]]. More generally, cognitivism with respect to any area of discourse is the position that sentences used in that discourse are cognitive, that is, are meaningful and capable of being true or false. In [[psychology]], cognitivism is the approach to understanding the mind that argues that mental function can be understood as the 'internal' rule bound manipulation of symbols. See [[Cognitivism (psychology)]]. }}
{{Term|term= Coherentism |content= [[Coherentism]] }}{{defn|1= There are two distinct types of coherentism. One refers to the [[Truth#Coherence theory|coherence theory of truth]], which restricts true sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true [[if and only if]] it is coherent with all or most of their other beliefs. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of [[Occam's razor]] are usually to be preferred. The second type of coherentism is the belief in the coherence [[theory of justification]], an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] theory opposing [[foundationalism]] and offering a solution to the [[regress argument]]. In this epistemological capacity, it is a theory about how [[belief]] can be [[theory of justification|justified]]. }}
{{Term|term= Colbertism |content= [[Colbertism]] }}{{defn|1= a variation of [[mercantilism]], which has applied in [[France]] between 1661 and 1683 by the [[superintendent of Finances]] [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]. }}
{{Term|term= Collectivism |content= [[Collectivism]]<ref name="Oxford"/> }}{{defn|1= a theoretical or practical emphasis on the group, as opposed to (and seen by many of its opponents to be at the expense of) the individual. Some psychologists define collectivism as a syndrome of attitudes and behaviors based on the belief that the basic unit of survival lies within a group, not the individual. Collectivists typically hold that the "greater good" of the group, is more important than the good of any particular individual who is one part of that larger organization. Some collectivists argue that the individual ''incidentally'' serves his own interests by working for the benefit of the group. }}
{{Term|term= Communalism |content= [[Communalism]] }}{{defn|1= Outside of [[South Asia]], communalism involves a broad range of [[social movement]]s and [[social theories]] in some way centered upon the [[community]]. Communalism can take the form of communal living or communal property, among others. It is sometimes said to put the interests of the community above the interests of the individual, but this is usually only done on the principle that the community exists for the benefit of the individuals who participate in it, so the best way to serve the interests of the individual is through the interests of the community. }}
{{Term|term= Communism |content= [[Communism]]<ref name="Oxford"/> }}{{defn|1= a theoretical system of social organization and a political movement based on common ownership of the means of production. As a political movement, communism seeks to establish a classless society. A major force in world politics since the early 20th century, modern communism is generally associated with The Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, according to which the capitalist profit-based system of private ownership is replaced by a communist society in which the means of production are communally owned, such as through a [[gift economy]]. Often this process is said initiated by the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie (see Marxism), passes through a transitional period marked by the preparatory stage of socialism (see Leninism). Pure communism has never been implemented, it remains theoretical: communism is, in Marxist theory, the end-state, or the result of state-socialism. The word is now mainly understood to refer to the political, economic, and social theory of Marxist thinkers, or life under conditions of Communist party rule. }}
{{Term|term= Communitarianism |content= [[Communitarianism]] }}{{defn|1= a group of related but distinct philosophies that began in the late 20th century, opposing aspects of liberalism and capitalism while advocating phenomena such as civil society. Not necessarily hostile to liberalism in the contemporary American sense of the word, communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual. The question of priority (individual or community) often has the largest impact in the most pressing ethical questions: health care, abortion, multiculturalism, hate speech, and so on. }}
{{Term|term= Compatibilism |content= [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|Compatibilism]] }}{{defn|1= also known as "soft determinism" and championed by [[David Hume|Hume]], is a theory that holds that [[free will]] and [[determinism]] are compatible. According to Hume, free will should not be understood as an absolute ability to have chosen differently under exactly the same inner and outer circumstances. Rather, it is a hypothetical ability to have chosen differently if one had been differently psychologically disposed by some different beliefs or desires. Hume also maintains that free acts are not uncaused (or mysteriously self-caused as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] would have it) but caused by our choices as determined by our beliefs, desires, and by our characters. While a decision making process exists in Hume's determinism, this process is governed by a causal chain of events. }}
{{Term|term= Comtism |content= [[Comtism]] }}{{defn|1= [[Auguste Comte]]'s positivistic [[philosophy]] that [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] should be replaced by a hierarchy of sciences from [[mathematics]] at the base to [[sociology]] at the top. }}
{{Term|term= Conceptualism |content= [[Conceptualism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[doctrine]] in [[philosophy]] intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], that [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]s exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial [[reality]]. }}
{{Term|term= Confucianism |content= [[Confucianism]] }}{{defn|1= an East Asian ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage [[Confucius]]. It is a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought that has had tremendous influence on the history of Chinese civilization down to the 21st century. Some have considered it to have been the "state religion" of imperial China. }}
*{{Term|term= Neo-Confucianism |content= [[Neo-Confucianism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of Confucianism that was primarily developed during the [[Song dynasty]], as a response to the dominance of [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]] at the time. Neo-Confucians such as [[Zhu Xi]] recognized that the Confucianism lacked a thorough [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system, and so synthesized one based on previous Confucian concepts. There were many competing views within the Neo-Confucian community, but overall, a system emerged that resembled both the Buddhist and Taoist thought of the time. }}
*{{Term|term= New Confucianism |content= [[New Confucianism]] }}{{defn|1= a new movement of [[Confucianism]] since the 20th century applying Confucianism to modern times. Not to be confused with [[Neo-Confucianism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Consequentialism |content= [[Consequentialism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that what ultimately matters in evaluating actions or policies of action are the consequences that result from choosing one action or policy rather than the alternative. }}
{{Term|term= Constructivism |content= [[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that reality, or at least our knowledge of it, is a value-laden subjective construction rather than a passive acquisition of objective features. }}

{{Term|term= Contextualism |content= [[Contextualism]] }}{{defn|1= a collection of views that emphasize the ''context'' in which an action, utterance or expression occurs, and argues that, in some important respect, the action, utterance or expression can only be understood within that context. Contextualist views hold that philosophically controversial concepts, such as "meaning <var>P</var>", "knowing that <var>P</var>", "having a reason to <var>A</var>", and possibly even "being true" or "being right" only have meaning relative to a specified context. Some philosophers hold that context-dependence may lead to [[relativism]]; nevertheless, contextualist views are increasingly popular within philosophy. }}
{{Term|term= Conventionalism |content= [[Conventionalism]] }}{{defn|1= philosophical attitude that fundamental principles of a certain kind are grounded on (explicit or implicit) agreements in society, rather than on external reality. Although this attitude is commonly held with respect to the rules of grammar and the principles of etiquette, its application to the propositions of law, ethics, science, mathematics, and logic is more controversial. }}

The intervention may be seen either as an ''act of creation'' from nothing (''[[ex nihilo]]'') or the emergence of order from pre-existing chaos. }}
*{{Term|term= Day-age creationism |content= [[Day-age creationism]] }}{{defn|1= a type of [[Old Earth creationism]], it is an effort to reconcile Creation as presented in  [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] with modern scientific theories on the age of the Universe. It holds that the [[Hexameron|six days]] referred to in Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but are much longer periods, thus interpreting Genesis as cosmic [[evolution]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Evolutionary creationism |content= [[Evolutionary creationism]] }}{{defn|1= A lesser used term for [[theistic evolution]], the general opinion that some or all classical religious teachings about [[God]] and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of the modern scientific understanding about biological [[evolution]]. Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory|theory]] in the [[Science|scientific]] sense, but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to some religious interpretations. }}
*{{Term|term= Gap creationism |content= [[Gap creationism]] }}{{defn|1= also called ''Restitution creationism'' or ''Ruin-Reconstruction''; a particular set of Christian beliefs about the creation of the [[Universe]] and the origin of man. The concept of the Gap Theory is widely thought to have been promulgated by [[William Buckland]] and [[Thomas Chalmers]] in the early 19th century, though some adherents maintain that it can be traced back to biblical times. Certainly it became quite popular when it was promoted by the [[Scofield Reference Bible]] in 1909. }}
*{{Term|term= Old Earth creationism |content= [[Old Earth creationism]] }}{{defn|1= a variant of the [[Creationism|creationist]] view of the origin of the [[universe]] and [[life on Earth]]. As a theory of origins it is typically more compatible with mainstream scientific thought on the issues of [[geology]], [[cosmology]] and the [[age of the Earth]], in comparison to [[Young Earth creationism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Young Earth creationism |content= [[Young Earth creationism]] }}{{defn|1= the religious belief that Heaven, Earth, and [[life on Earth]] were created by a direct act of [[God]] dating between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. Its adherents are those [[Christian]]s, [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s who believe that [[God]] created the Earth in six 24-hour days, taking the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] text of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]] as a [[Biblical literalism|literal account]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Omphalos creationism |content= [[Omphalos creationism]] }}{{defn|1= named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", God must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s (''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed [[Age of the Earth|age of the earth]] and [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable. The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern [[Creationism|creationists]], who have extended the argument to light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], although many other creationists reject this explanation (and also believe that Adam and Eve had no navels). }}
{{Term|term= Cynicism |content= [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] }}{{defn|1= was originally the [[philosophy]] of a group of ancient [[Greeks]] called the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] (''main article''), founded by [[Antisthenes]]. Nowadays the word generally refers to the opinions of those inclined to disbelieve in human sincerity, in [[virtue]], or in [[altruism]]: individuals who maintain that only self-interest motivates human behavior. A modern cynic typically has a highly contemptuous attitude towards social [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, especially those that serve more of a [[ritual]]istic purpose than a practical one, and will tend to dismiss a substantial proportion of [[Mainstream|popular]] [[belief]]s, conventional [[morality]] and accepted [[wisdom]] as irrelevant or obsolete nonsense. }}

{{Term|term= Darwinism |content= [[Darwinism]] }}{{defn|1= a pejorative term for the scientific theory of evolution used mostly by its [[Objections to evolution|opponents]]. This theory was first presented by [[Charles Darwin]] in his 1859 book ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. It stated that the variety of life found on Earth is due to the process of [[evolution]] driven by the mechanism of [[natural selection]]. It is to be contrasted with [[Creationism]] and [[Intelligent Design]]. There is a lively debate as to whether or not the theory of evolution is compatible with any, all or some religions. }}
{{Term|term= Deconstructionism |content= [[Deconstruction]]ism }}{{defn|1= school and a set of methods of textual criticism aimed at understanding the assumptions and ideas that form the basis for thought and belief. Also called "deconstruction", its central concern is a radical critique of the [[metaphysics]] of the Western philosophical tradition, in which it identifies a [[Phallogocentrism|logicentrism]] or "[[metaphysics of presence]]" which holds that speech-thought (the ''logos'') is a privileged, ideal, and self-present entity, through which all discourse and meaning derive. This logocentrism is the primary target of deconstruction. }}

{{Term|term= Defeatism |content= [[Defeatism]] }}{{defn|1= Defeatism is acceptance and content with defeat without struggle. In everyday use, defeatism has negative connotation, and is often linked to treason and pessimism. The term is commonly used in the context of war: a soldier can be a defeatist if he or she refuses to fight because he or she thinks that the fight will be lost for sure or that it is not worth fighting for some other reason. The term can also be used in other fields, like politics, sports, psychology and philosophy. }}
{{Term|term= Deism |content= [[Deism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that [[reason]], rather than [[revelation]] or [[tradition]], should be the basis of belief in God. Deists reject both organized and revealed religion and maintain that reason is the essential element in all knowledge. For a "rational basis for religion" they refer to the [[cosmological argument]] (first cause argument), the [[teleological argument]] (argument from design), and other aspects of what was called ''[[natural theology|natural religion]]''. Deism has become identified with the classical belief that God created but does not intervene in the world, though this is not a necessary component of deism. }}
*{{Term|term= Pandeism |content= [[Pandeism]] }}{{defn|1= a type of deism that combines the deistic belief in a rationally determined, non-intervening God with the idea of pantheism (under theism, below) of God being identical to the Universe. }}
{{Term|term= Deontologism |content= [[Deontologism]] }}{{defn|1= ethical theory considered solely on duty and rights, where one has an unchanging moral obligation to abide by a set of defined principles. Thus, the ends of any action never justify the means in this ethical system. If someone were to do their moral duty, then it would not matter if it had negative consequences. Therefore, consequentialism is the philosophical antithesis of this theory. }}
{{Term|term= Descriptivism |content= [[Descriptivist theory of names|Descriptivism]] }}{{defn|1= also called the ''Descriptivist theory of names'', is a view of the nature of the meaning and reference of proper names generally attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. The theory consists essentially in the idea that the meanings of names are identical to the descriptions associated with them by speakers, while their referents are determined to be the objects that satisfy these descriptions. }}

A dogmatic position is not open to rational argument, and is "established" only according to a particular point of view, and therefore of doubtful foundation. }}
{{Term|term= Dualism |content= [[Dualism]] }}{{defn|1= a set of beliefs that begins with the claim that the [[mind|mental]] and the [[nature|physical]] have a fundamentally different nature. It is contrasted with varying kinds of [[monism]], including [[materialism]] and [[phenomenalism]]. Dualism is one answer to the [[mind-body problem]]. [[Pluralism (philosophy of mind)|Pluralism]] holds that there are even more kinds of events or things in the world. }}
*{{Term|term= Substance dualism |content= [[Substance dualism]] }}{{defn|1= is a type of [[ontological dualism]] defended by [[Descartes]] in which it is claimed that there are two fundamental kinds of substance: mental and material. The mental does not extend in space, and material cannot think. It holds that immortal souls occupy an independent realm of existence, while apparently bodies die. This view contradicts [[physicalism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Dynamism |content= [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|Dynamism]] }}{{defn|1= [[cosmology|cosmological]] framework developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716). The idea behind Dynamism in [[cosmology (metaphysics)|metaphysical cosmology]] is that the material world can be explained in terms of active, point-like ''forces,'' with no extension but with [[action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. Dynamism describes that which exists as simple elements, or for Leibniz, [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]]s, and groups of elements that have only the essence of [[force]]s. It was developed as a reaction against the passive view of matter in [[mechanism (philosophy)|philosophical mechanism]]. }}

{{Term|term= Emotionalism |content= [[Emotionalism]] }}{{defn|1= an inclination to rely on or place too much value on emotion. It could be argued that very few, if any, people would label themselves "emotionalists", but rather that it would be a derogatory term applied to them, possibly for exhibiting a [[wiktionary:zeal|zealous]] demeanor, which may be interpreted as an [[appeal to emotion]]. }}
{{Term|term= Emotivism |content= [[Emotivism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitivist]] [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory that ethical judgments are primarily ''expressions'' of one's own attitude and ''imperatives'' meant to change the attitudes and actions of another.

{{Term|term= Epiphenomenalism |content= [[Epiphenomenalism]] }}{{defn|1= the view in [[philosophy of mind]] according to which [[nature|physical]] events have [[mind|mental]] effects, but mental events have no effects of any kind. In other words, the [[causality|causal]] relations go only one way, from physical to mental. In recent times it is usually considered a type of [[dualism]], because it postulates physical events but also non-physical mental events; but historically it has sometimes been thought a kind of [[monism]], because of its sharp divergence from [[substance dualism]]. }}

{{Term|term= Eternalism |content= [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[philosophy|philosophical]] approach to the [[ontology|ontological]] nature of [[philosophy of space and time|time]]. It builds on the standard method of modeling time as a [[dimension]] in [[physics]], to give time a similar [[ontology]] to that of [[space]]. This would mean that time is just another dimension, that [[future]] events are "already there", and that there is no [[objectivity (frame invariance)|objective]] flow of time. }}
{{Term|term= Ethical egoism |content= [[Ethical egoism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[Enlightened self-interest|self-interest]]. It is distinguished from [[psychological egoism]] and [[rational egoism]]. It contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an ethical [[obligation]] to help or serve others. Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to disregard the well-being of others, nor does it require that a moral agent refrains from considering the [[well-being]] of others in moral deliberation. What is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental to, beneficial to, or neutral in its effect on others. It allows for the possibility of either as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying self-interest of the agent. Ethical egoism is sometimes used to support [[libertarianism]] or [[anarchism]], political positions based partly on a belief that individuals should not coercively prevent others from exercising freedom of action. }}

It is defined as the viewpoint that "one's own group is the center of everything (better than all other cultures)," against which all other groups are judged. Ethnocentrism often entails the belief that one's own race or ethnic group is the most important and/or that some or all aspects of its culture are superior to those of other groups. }}

It can also apply to some literature; the works of [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Georg Kaiser]] are often said to be expressionistic, for example. }}
{{Term|term= Expressivism |content= [[Expressivism]] }}{{defn|1=  a theory about the meaning of [[morality|moral language]]. According to expressivism, sentences that employ moral terms–for example, "It is wrong to torture an innocent human being"–are not descriptive or fact-stating; moral terms such as "wrong," "good," or "just" do not refer to real, in-the-world properties. The primary function of moral sentences, according to expressivism, is not to assert any matter of fact, but rather to express an evaluative attitude toward an object of evaluation.<ref>Horgan & Timmons (2006c), pp. 220-221.</ref>  Because the function of moral language is non-descriptive, moral sentences do not have any truth conditions.<ref>Horgan & Timmons (2006b), p. 86</ref>  Hence, expressivists either do not allow that moral sentences have truth value, or rely on a notion of [[truth|truth value]] that does not appeal to any descriptive truth conditions being met for moral sentences. }}

{{Term|term= Fallibilism |content= [[Fallibilism]] }}{{defn|1= doctrine that absolute certainty about [[knowledge]] is impossible; or at least that all claims to knowledge could, in principle, be mistaken. As a formal doctrine, it is most strongly associated with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who used it in his attack on [[foundationalism]]. Unlike [[scepticism]], fallibilism does not imply the need to abandon our knowledge- we needn't have logically conclusive justifications for what we know. Rather, it is an admission that because [[empirical]] knowledge can be revised by further observation, all knowledge, excepting that which is axiomatically true (such as [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[logic]]al knowledge) exists in a constant state of flux. }}
{{Term|term= Falsificationism |content= [[Falsificationism]] }}{{defn|1= the idea that a proposition or theory cannot be scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown to be false.

{{Term|term= Fatalism |content= [[Fatalism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that human deliberation and actions are pointless and ineffectual in determining events, because whatever will be will be. One ancient argument, called the ''idle argument'', went like this: "If it is [[destiny|fate]]d for you to recover from your illness, then you will recover whether you call a doctor or not. Likewise, if you are fated not to recover, you will not do so even if you call a doctor. So, calling a doctor makes no difference." Arguments like this are usually rejected even by causal [[determinism|determinists]], who may say that it may be determined that only a doctor can cure you. }}
{{Term|term= Fideism |content= [[Fideism]] }}{{defn|1= In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], the position that [[reason]] is more-or-less irrelevant to religious belief, that rational or scientific [[arguments for the existence of God]] are fallacious and irrelevant, and have nothing to do with the truth of Christian theology. Its argument in essence goes: "Christian theology teaches that people are [[salvation|saved]] by [[faith]]. But, if God's existence can be ''proven'', either [[empiricism|empirically]] or [[logic]]ally, faith becomes irrelevant. Therefore, if Christian theology is true, no proof of God's existence is possible." The term is occasionally used to refer to a belief that Christians are saved by [[faith]] alone: for which see ''[[sola fide]]''. This position is sometimes called ''[[solifidianism]]''. }}

* A certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]].
* A school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] that emphasises the fairness of process over substantive outcomes. See [[Legal formalism]].
* In [[economic anthropology]], '''formalism''' is the theoretical perspective that the principles of neoclassical economics can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.
* A certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]].
* A set of notations and rules for manipulating them that yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation. These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].
* In the study of the arts and literature, '''formalism''' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. See [[formalism (art)]], [[formalism (literature)]].
* In the study of film and film theory, '''formalism''' is a style of criticism that focuses on the technical aspects of filmmaking (e.g., lighting, sets, costumes, etc.). The term also referred to an [[avant-garde]] [[experimental film]] movement, often seen as odd or extremist, that was concerned with the beauty of the actual physical form of film (i.e., the celluloid itself). {{main|Formalist film theory}}

Basic beliefs are beliefs that are [[epistemic self-justification|self-justifying]] or [[self-evidence|self-evident]], and don't need to be justified ''by other beliefs.'' Basic beliefs provide [[epistemic support|justificatory support]] to other beliefs, which can in turn [[basing relation in epistemology|support]] further derivative beliefs.

The idea is that whenever we experience something, we experience it as it is ''for ourselves'': the object is real as well as mind-independent, but is in a sense ''corrupted'' by our cognition (by the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] and the forms of sensibility, space and time).

The term appears in [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s "The [[Problem of the Criterion]]", and in the work of his student, [[Ernest Sosa]] ("The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge"). Particularism is contrasted with [[Methodism (philosophy)|Methodism]], which answers the latter question before the former.

It involves a general belief that things are bad, and tend to become worse; or that looks to the eventual triumph of evil over good; it contrasts with optimism, the contrary belief in the goodness and betterment of things generally. A common conundrum illustrates optimism versus pessimism with the question - does one regard a given glass of water as: "Is the glass half empty or half full?"

It explores what and how people come to know, including [[existence]] itself, and how that knowledge is reliably and usefully represented, and communicated between and among humans, whether in [[thought]], by [[language]], or with [[mathematics]]. Philosophy is the predecessor and complement of science, and its foundation. It develops notions about the issues that underlie [[science]], and ponders the nature of thought itself. In science, the scientific method, which involves repeated observations of the results of controlled experiments, is an available and highly successful philosophical [[methodology]]. Within fields of study that are concerned directly with humans (economics, psychology, sociology and so forth), in which experimental methodologies are not generally available, subdisciplines of philosophy are developed to provide a rational basis of study in the respective fields. }}
{{Term|term= Physicalism |content= [[Physicalism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] position asserting that everything that exists has a [[physical properties|physical property]]; that is, that there are no kinds of things other than physical things. In contemporary [[philosophy]] physicalism is most frequently associated with [[philosophy of mind]], in particular the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind/body problem]], in which it holds that the mind is a physical thing in some sense. Physicalism is also called "materialism", but the term "physicalism" is preferable because it has evolved with the physical sciences to incorporate far more sophisticated notions of physicality than matter, for example wave/particle relationships and unseen, non-material forces. }}

It was also influenced to some degree by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later criticisms of [[analytic philosophy]]. Within postmodern philosophy, there are numerous interrelated fields, including [[deconstruction]] and several fields beginning with the prefix "post-", such as [[post-structuralism]], [[post-Marxism]], and [[post-feminism]]. In particular postmodern philosophy has spawned a huge literature of [[critical theory]]. }}
{{Term|term= Pragmatism |content= [[Pragmatism]] }}{{defn|1= [[philosophy]] that originated in the [[United States]] in the late 19th century. Pragmatism is characterized by the insistence on consequences, utility and practicality as vital components of meaning and truth. Pragmatism objects to the view that human concepts and intellect represent reality, and therefore stands in opposition to both [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] and [[rationalist]] schools of [[philosophy]].

{{Term|term= Teleologism |content= [[Teleologism]] }}{{defn|1= the supposition that there is design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the works and processes of nature, and the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of that purpose. Teleology stands in contrast to [[philosophical naturalism]], and both ask questions separate from the questions of [[science]]. While science investigates natural laws and phenomena, Philosophical naturalism and teleology investigate the existence or non-existence of an organizing principle behind those natural laws and phenomena. Philosophical naturalism asserts that there are no such principles. Teleology asserts that there are. }}
{{Term|term= Theism |content= [[Theism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that there is one or more [[deity|god]]s or [[goddess]]es.<ref>[[Richard Swinburne|Swinburne, Richard]]. ''The Coherence of Theism'', Introduction.</ref> More specifically, it may also mean the belief in God, a god, or gods, who is/are actively involved in maintaining the [[Universe]]. A theist can also take the position that he does not have sufficient evidence to "know" whether God or gods exist, although he believes it through faith. }}
*{{Term|term= Monotheism |content= [[Monotheism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief in a single, universal, all-encompassing [[deity]]. [[Zoroastrianism]] and the [[Abrahamic religion]]s are considered Monotheist. }}
**{{Term|term= Classical theism |content= [[Classical theism]] }}{{defn|1= refers to traditional ideas of the [[monotheistic]] religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Classical theism holds that God is an absolute, [[eternity|eternal]], all-knowing ([[omniscient]]), all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]), and perfect being. God is related to the world as its cause, but is unaffected by the world (immutable). He is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] over the world, which exists relative to him as a temporal effect. }}
**{{Term|term= Deism |content= [[Deism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of monotheism in which it is believed that one god exists. However, a deist rejects the idea that this god intervenes in the world. Hence any notion of special [[revelation]] is impossible, and the nature of god can only be known through reason and observation from nature. A deist thus rejects the miraculous, and the claim to knowledge made for religious groups and texts. }}
**{{Term|term= Cosmotheism |content= Cosmotheism }}{{defn|1= synonym for pantheism (see below). }}
**{{Term|term= Monistic theism |content= [[Monistic theism]] }}{{defn|1= the type of monotheism found in Hinduism. This type of theism is different from the Semitic religions as it encompasses [[panentheism]], [[monism]], and at the same time includes the concept of a personal God as a universal, omnipotent supreme being. The other types of monotheism are qualified monism, the school of [[Ramanuja]] or [[Vishishtadvaita]], which admits that the universe is part of God, or [[Narayana]], a type of [[panentheism]], but there is a plurality of souls within this supreme Being and [[Dvaita]], which differs in that it is dualistic, as God is separate and not panentheistic. }}
**{{Term|term= Pantheism |content= [[Pantheism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that everything is of an all-encompassing immanent God; or that the universe, or nature, and God are equivalent. More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that natural law, existence and/or the universe (the sum total of all that is was and shall be) is represented or personified in the theological principle of 'God'. The existence of a transcendent supreme extraneous to nature is denied. Depending on how this is understood, such a view may be presented as tantamount to [[atheism]], [[deism]] or [[theism]]. }}
***{{Term|term= Pandeism |content= [[Pandeism]] }}{{defn|1= a type of pantheism that combines the pantheistic belief of God being identical to the Universe with the idea from deism (above) that God is revealed by rational examination and does not intervene in the Universe. }}
**{{Term|term=  Panentheism|content= [[Panentheism]] }}{{defn|1= the theological position that [[God]] is [[Immanence|immanent]] within the [[Universe]], but also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it. It is distinguished from [[pantheism]], which holds that God is synonymous with the material universe. In panentheism, God is viewed as creator and/or animating force behind the universe, and the source of [[universal morality]]. The term is closely associated with the [[Logos]] of [[Greek philosophy]] in the works of [[Herakleitos]], which pervades the [[cosmos]] and whereby all things were made. }}
**{{Term|term= Substance monotheism |content= [[Substance monotheism]] }}{{defn|1= found e.g. in some indigenous African religions, holds that the many gods are different forms of a single underlying substance, and that this underlying substance is God. This view has some similarities to the Christian [[Trinity|trinitarian]] view of three persons sharing one nature. }}
**{{Term|term= Transtheism |content= [[Transtheism]] }}{{defn|1= assumes the existence of [[God]] as an absent [[deity]] and the [[The Ultimate (philosophy)|ultimate]] concept of God's existence is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and external to all other forms of existence, which implies an impersonal, non-anthropomorphic, non-universemorphic or even non-cosmosmorphic being and view of God. In transtheism, God has one primary attribute, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Nontheism |content= [[Nontheism]] }}{{defn|1= the absence of belief in both the existence ''and'' non-existence of a [[deity]] (or [[polytheism|deities]], or other [[numinous]] phenomena). The word is often employed as a blanket term for all belief systems that are not [[theism|theistic]], including [[atheism]] (both [[strong atheism|strong]] and [[weak atheism|weak]]) and [[agnosticism]], as well as certain [[Eastern religion]]s like [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zen Buddhism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Polytheism |content= [[Polytheism]] }}{{defn|1= belief in, or worship of, multiple [[deity|gods]] or divinities. Most ancient religions were polytheistic, holding to [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]s of traditional deities, often accumulated over centuries of cultural interchange and experience. The belief in many gods does not contradict or preclude also believing in an all-powerful all-knowing supreme being. }}
**{{Term|term= Henotheism |content= [[Henotheism]] }}{{defn|1= devotion to a single [[deity|god]] while accepting the existence of other [[deity|gods]]. Coined by [[Max Müller]], according to whom it is "[[monotheism]] in principle and a [[polytheism]] in fact". Variations on the term have been ''inclusive monotheism'' and ''monarchial polytheism'', designed to differentiate differing forms of the phenomenon. }}
*{{Term|term= Open theism |content= [[Open theism]] }}{{defn|1= A religious approach combining [[Classical Theism]] as well as [[Ancient Greek]] beliefs that question the ideas of [[free will]] and the [[God and eternity|timeless]] nature of [[God]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Philosophical theism |content= [[Philosophical theism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that [[God]] exists (or must exist), independent of the teaching or revelation of any particular [[religion]]. Some philosophical theists are persuaded of God's existence by philosophical arguments, while others consider themselves to have a religious faith that need not be, or could not be, supported by rational argument. }}
{{Term|term= Theological noncognitivism |content= [[Theological noncognitivism]] }}{{defn|1= the argument that [[religious]] [[language]], and specifically words like "[[God]]" (capitalized), are not cognitively meaningful. It is cited as proof of the nonexistence of anything named "God", and therefore is a basis for [[atheism]]. There are two main arguments: [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] used [[verifiability theory of meaning]] to conclude that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable, proving [[weak atheism]]. [[George H. Smith]] used an attribute-based approach to argue that the concept "god" has no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or relational attributes, making it meaningless — leading to the conclusion that "god does not exist", thus proving [[strong atheism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Thomism |content= [[Thomism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical school that followed in the legacy of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The word comes from the name of its originator, whose summary work ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' has arguably been second to only the [[Bible]] in importance to the Catholic Church. }}
{{Term|term= Totalitarianism |content= [[Totalitarianism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[ideal type|typology]] employed by [[political science|political scientists]] to denote [[Modernism|modern]] [[regime]]s in which the [[State (polity)|state]] regulates nearly every aspect of public and private behavior. Totalitarian regimes mobilize entire populations in support of the state and a political [[ideology]], and do not tolerate activities by individuals or groups such as [[labor union]]s, [[Church body|churches]] and [[political party|political parties]] that are not directed toward the state's goals. They maintain themselves in power by means of [[secret police]], [[propaganda]] disseminated through the state-controlled [[mass media]], regulation and restriction of [[freedom of speech|free discussion and criticism]], and widespread use of terror tactics. }}
{{Term|term= Transcendental idealism |content= [[Transcendental idealism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] and later Kantian and German Idealist philosophers; a view according to which our experience is not about the things as they are in themselves, but about the things as they appear to us. It differs from standard (empirical) [[idealism]] in that it does not claim that the objects of our experiences would be in any sense ''within'' our mind. The idea is that whenever we experience something, we experience it as it is ''for ourselves'': the object is real as well as mind-independent, but is in a sense ''corrupted'' by our cognition (by the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] and the forms of sensibility, space and time). Transcendental idealism denies that we could have knowledge of the thing in itself. A view that holds the opposite is called transcendental realism. }}
{{Term|term= Transcendentalism |content= [[Transcendentalism]] }}{{defn|1= a group of new ideas in [[literature]], [[religion]], [[culture]], and [[philosophy]] that advocates that there is an ideal [[spirituality|spiritual]] state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through a knowledgeable intuitive awareness that is conditional upon the individual. The concept emerged in [[New England]] in the early-to mid-19th century. It is sometimes called "''American'' ''Transcendentalism''" to distinguish it from other uses of the word ''[[Transcendence (disambiguation)|transcendental]]''. It began as a protest against the general state of culture and [[society]] at the time, and in particular, the state of [[intellectualism]] at [[Harvard]] and the doctrine of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church that was taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. The term ''transcendentalism'' sometimes serves as shorthand for "[[transcendental idealism]]". Another alternative meaning for ''transcendentalism'' is the classical philosophy that God transcends the manifest world. As [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] put it to [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charles the Bald]] in the year 840 A.D., "We do not know what God is. God himself doesn't know what He is because He is not anything. Literally God is not, because He transcends being." }}
{{Term|term= Transhumanism |content= [[Transhumanism]] }}{{defn|1= a term often used as a synonym for "[[human enhancement]]", is an international, intellectual and cultural movement supporting the use of new [[science]]s and [[technology|technologies]] to enhance human [[human brain|mental]] and [[human anatomy|physical]] abilities and [[aptitude]]s, and [[meliorism|ameliorate]] what it regards as undesirable and unnecessary aspects of the [[human condition]], such as [[suffering]], [[disease]], [[aging]] and involuntary [[death]]. }}
{{Term|term= Transtheism |content= [[Transtheism]] }}{{defn|1= ''see its entry under theism, above.'' }}
{{Term|term= Truth claim | content = [[Truth claim]] }}{{defn|1= a statement that is either [[truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]], and claimed to be true }}

{{Term|term= Universalism |content= [[Moral universalism|Universalism]] }}{{defn|1= [[synonym]] for [[moral universalism]], as a compromise between [[moral relativism]] and [[moral absolutism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Utilitarianism |content= [[Utilitarianism]] }}{{defn|1= theory of [[ethics]] that maintains an act is moral if and only if it maximizes welfare. It is a form of [[consequentialism]] and welfarism.}}
{{Term|term= Utopianism |content= [[Utopianism]] }}{{defn|1= the many various social and political movements, and a significant body of religious and secular literature, based upon the idea that [[paradise]] is achievable on earth. See [[Utopia]]. }}

{{Term|term= Value pluralism |content= [[Value pluralism]] }}{{defn|1= the idea that two or more moral values may be equally ultimate (true), yet in conflict. In addition, it postulates that in many cases, such incompatible values, may be rationally [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]]. As such, value-pluralism is a theory in [[metaethics]], rather than an ethical theory or a set of values in itself. The Oxford historian of ideas, [[Isaiah Berlin]], is accredited with having done the first substantial work on value-pluralism, bringing it to the attention of general academia. }}
{{Term|term= Verificationism |content= [[Verificationism]] }}{{defn|1= an [[epistemic theories of truth|epistemic theory of truth]] based on the idea that the mind engages in a certain kind of activity: "verifying" a [[proposition]]. The distinctive claim of verificationism is that the result of such verifications is, by definition, truth. That is, truth is reducible to this process of [[Verification theory|verification]]. }}
{{Term|term= Vitalism |content= [[Vitalism]] }}{{defn|1= the doctrine that '''"vital forces"''' are active in [[life|living organisms]], so that life cannot be explained solely by [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. That element is often referred to as the ''vital spark'' or ''energy,'' which some equate with the ''[[soul]].'' }}
{{Term|term= Voluntarism |content= [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|Voluntarism]] }}{{defn|1= school of thought that regards the will as superior to the [[Intelligence (trait)|intellect]] and to [[emotion]]. Introduced into philosophical literature by [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] and developed further in the writings of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Friedrich Paulsen]]. }}
{{Term|term= Voluntaryism |content= [[Voluntaryism]] }}{{defn|1= theory advocated by [[Auberon Herbert]], stressing "voluntary taxation" and the boycott of electoral politics. The original sources for voluntaryism can be found in Herbert's book "The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State." Some, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] view Herbert's philosophy as anarchism, however he never called himself an anarchist as he considered anarchism to be a philosophy that does not provide for defense of person and property. }}

It places great importance on moment-by-moment awareness and 'seeing deeply into the nature of things' by direct experience. The name derives from the Sanskrit word ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' referring to a particular [[meditation|meditative]] state. }}
