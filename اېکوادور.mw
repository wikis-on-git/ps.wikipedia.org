The '''Republic of Ecuador''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República del Ecuador'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[re'puβlika ðel ekwa'ðoɾ]}}) is a country in northwestern [[South America]], bounded by [[کولمبيا]] on the north, by [[Peru]] on the east and south, and by the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the west. The country also includes the [[Galápagos Islands]] (Archipelago de Colón) in the Pacific, about 965 kilometers (about 600&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) west of the mainland.  Named after the Spanish word for [[equator]], Ecuador straddles the equator and has an area of 272,045 [[square kilometer]]s (105,037&nbsp;[[square mile|mi²]]). [[Quito]] is the country’s capital. 

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[History of Ecuador]]''

Advanced [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] cultures flourished in Ecuador long before the area was conquered by the [[Inca empire]] in the 15th century. By marriage, the reign of Quito became part of the Inca Empire. [[Atahuallpa]], one of the sons of the Incan emperor, was born in Quito; however, he could not receive the crown of the Empire since the Inca had another son, [[Huascar]], born in [[Cuzco]], the capital. Therefore the empire was divided in two: Atahuallpa received the north, with his capital in Quito, and Huascar received the south with its capital in Cuzco. In 1531, the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistadors]], under the lead of [[Francisco Pizarro]], arrived and found a civil war in the Inca empire the Spaniards took advantage of the situation  and defeated Atahuallpa and his army during the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] in 1532, as Atahuallpa returned from killing his step brother Huascar. In subsequent years the Spanish colonists became the new elite centering its power in Peru.

The indigenous population was decimated by disease in the first decades of Spanish rule — a time when the natives also were forced into the "[[encomienda]]" labor system for Spanish landlords. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a royal "audiencia" (administrative district) of Spain and part of the Peruvian Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima.

After nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, and it was there on [[August 10]], [[1809]], that the first cry for independence was heard.  After independence forces defeated the royalist army in 1822, Ecuador joined [[Simon Bolivar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], only to become a separate republic in 1830.

The 19th century was marked by instability, with a rapid succession of rulers. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In the late 1800s, world demand for [[cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.

A coastal-based liberal revolution in 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and opened the way for capitalist development. The end of the cocoa boom produced renewed political instability and a military coup occurred in 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by populist politicians such as five-time President [[José Velasco Ibarra]]. 

Control over territory in the Amazon has led to a long time dispute between Ecuador and [[Peru]]. In [[1941]], in midst of fastly growing tensions between the two countries, war broke out. [[Peru]] claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion. Ecuador, on the other hand claimed Peru invaded Ecuador. In [[July]] [[1941]] troops were mobilized. Peru had a strength of 11,681 much better trained and equipped troops while Ecuador had a strength of 5,300 poorly trained soldiers. This was no surprise as Peru has housed one of the strongest [[Military of Peru|armed forces]] in [[South America]] over the course of thousands of years. It was second only to [[Brazil]] in [[2005]] [http://americas.irc-online.org/am/165 28] beating even [[Argentina]]. Over the course of the war [[Peru]] obtained all the disputed territory including the two Ecuadorian provinces of [[El Oro]] and [[Loja]] (6% if the country) for ransom. The [[Peruvian Navy]] blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]] cutting supplies to the Ecuadorian troops who numbered no more than six thousand. After a few weeks of war, Ecuador and Peru came to an accord in the [[Rio Protocol]] and fighting stopped in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[WWII]]. As a result of its victory over the less prepared Ecuadorian troops, Peru was awarded the disputed territory. Two more wars would follow to finally end the dispute. ''See [[Paquisha Incident]] and [[Cenepa War]]''

Recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, a nationalist military regime seized power and used the new oil wealth and foreign borrowing to pay for a program of industrialization, land reform, and subsidies for urban consumers. With the oil boom fading, Ecuador returned to [[democracy]] in 1979, but by 1982, the government faced an economic crisis, characterized by high [[inflation]], budget deficits, a falling currency, mounting debt service, and uncompetitive industries.

Since its return to democracy, Ecuador has been marked by chronic governmental instability. Many years of continuous mismanagement, starting with the mishandling of the country's debt during the 1970's military regime, have left the country essentially ungovernable. By the mid 90's, the government of Ecuador has been characterized by a weak executive branch that struggles to appease the ruling classes, represented in the legislative and judiciary. The last three democratically elected [[List of heads of state of Ecuador|presidents]] have failed to finish their terms during that period.

Among the most relevant factors in the democratic instability is the emergence of indigenous population as an active constituency. As a group, they were pushed into prominence due to government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lowering unemployment, and their historical exploitation by the land-holding elite.

Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the Elite and Leftist movements, have led to a deterioration of the executive office. Today, the notion that presidents are always in danger of being ousted by a majority in congress, a strike movement, or a combination thereof, is widely accepted, leading to deterioration and instability of the Executive Branch. Moreover, massive demonstrations of civil unrest has started a vicious circle in which presidents who are unwilling or unable to make the necessary moves towards popular policies are ousted; with all the economic and governmental fallout that such a drastic change entails. 

Ecuadorian presidential elections often run under populist principles, such social empowerment, drastically reducing inequality, and the idea of changing the economic and social status quo. However, the public and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital to work with, as it happened when in April 2005 Ecuador's Congress ousted President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]]. The Vice-President, [[Alfredo Palacio]], took his place and is expected to be in power until the next scheduled election. 

Ecuador is home to a large number of important master artists of the last century, which include [[Enrique Tábara]] (b. 1930), [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] (1919-1999), [[Eduardo Kingman]] (1913-1998), [[Aníbal Villacís]] (b. 1929), [[Félix Arauz]] (b. 1935), [[Manuel Rendón Seminario]] (1894-1982), [[Theo Constanté]] (b.1934), [[Luis Molinari]] (b. 1929), [[Juan Villafuerte]] (1945-1977), [[Oswaldo Viteri]] (b. 1931), [[Camilo Egas]] (1889-1962), [[Bolívar Mena Franco]] (1913-1995), [[Estuardo Maldonado]], [[Gonzalo Endara Crow]] (1936-1996), [[Luis Miranda]] and [[Judith Gutierrez]] (1927-2003).

The [[constitution]]  provides for concurrent 4-year terms of office for the president, vice president, and members of [[Congress]]. Presidents may be re-elected after an intervening term, while legislators may be re-elected immediately.

The executive branch includes 15 ministries. Provincial governors and councilors, like mayors and aldermen and parish boards, are directly elected. Congress meets throughout the year except for recess in July and December. There are twenty 7-member congressional committees. Justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the Congress for indefinite terms.

{{main|Foreign relations of Ecuador}}

Ecuador has often placed great emphasis on multilateral approaches to international issues. Ecuador is a member of the [[United Nations]] (and most of its specialized agencies) and also is a member of many regional groups, including the Rio Group, the Latin American Economic System, the Latin American Energy Organization, the Latin American Integration Association, and The Andean Pact.

''Main article: [[Geography of Ecuador]]''

Ecuador has three main geographic regions, plus an insular region in the [[Pacific Ocean]].
# The ''Costa'' comprises the low-lying litoral lying in the western part of the country. Its coastlines are on the Pacific.
# The ''Sierra'' region is the mountainous, high-altitude vertical belt running along the centre of the country. This region's [[topography]] is as a result of the [[Andes]] mountain range running along it.
# The ''Oriente'' (literally "East") comprises the [[Amazon rainforest]] areas in the eastern part of the country, accounting for just under half of the country's total surface area, though populated by under 5% of the population.
# Finally, the ''Región Insular'' is the region comprising the [[Galápagos Islands]], some 1,000 kilometers (620&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean. 

Ecuador's capital is [[Quito, Ecuador|Quito]], and is located in the province of [[Pichincha]] in the Sierra region. Its largest city is [[Guayaquil]], located in the province of [[Guayas]] in the Costa. [[Cotopaxi]], which is located just south of [[Quito]], in the neighbouring province of that same name, is the country's and the world's highest active volcano.

''Main article: [[Economy of Ecuador]]''

Ecuador has substantial [[petroleum]] resources and rich agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such as oil, [[banana]]s, and [[shrimp]], fluctuations in world market prices can have a substantial domestic impact. Industry is largely oriented to servicing the domestic market. Deteriorating economic performance in 1997-98 culminated in a severe economic and financial crisis in 1999. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks, including the El Niño weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global oil prices in 1997-98, and international emerging market instability in 1997-98. These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic policy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted in an 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2% and a 65% devaluation of the national currency in 1999, which helped precipitate an unprecedented default on external loans later that year.

On [[January 9]], [[2000]], the administration of President Jamil Mahuad announced its intention to adopt the [[U.S. dollar]] as the official currency of Ecuador to address the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the removal of Mahuad from office and the elevation of Vice President Gustavo Noboa to the presidency. The adoption of the U.S. dollar as currency, as opposed to pegging a local currency to it, means that the benefits of [[seigniorage]] accrue to the U.S. economy whether or not there is any compensation for this.

The Noboa government confirmed its commitment to dollarize as the centerpiece of its economic recovery strategy. The government also entered into negotiations with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), culminating in the negotiation of a 12-month stand-by arrangement with the Fund. Additional policy initiatives include efforts to reduce the government's fiscal deficit, implement structural reforms to strengthen the banking system and regain access to private capital markets. Buoyed by high oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2000, with GDP rising 1.9%. However, 70% of the population lives below the [[poverty line]], more than double the rate of 5 years ago. Inflation in 2000 remained high at 96.1%, but the rate of inflation continues to fall. Monthly inflation in February 2001 was 2.9%.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Ecuador]]''

Ecuador's population is ethnically diverse. The largest ethnic group is comprised of ''[[Mestizo]]s'', the mixed descendants of Spanish colonists and indigenous Amerindians, who constitute just over 65% of the population. [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] are second in numbers and account for approximately a quarter of the current population, around 25%. Whites are mainly ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'', primarily of Spanish descent, and account for 7%. The small [[Afro-Ecuadorian people|Afro-Ecuadorian]] minority — including [[Mulatto]]s and ''[[zambo]]s'' — constitutes the remainder.

Ecuadorians were heavily concentrated in the mountainous central highland region a few decades ago, however, today's population is divided about equally between that area and the coastal lowlands. Migration toward cities--particularly larger cities--in all regions has increased the urban population to about 55%. Due to an economic crisis in the late 1990s, more than 600,000 Ecuadorians [[emigration|emigrated]] to the U.S. and [[Europe]] from 2000 to 2001. The primary reasons for this were the economic and political upheaval that engulfed the country following Mahuad's ouster. Preferred destinations for emigrants include [[Spain]], the [[United States|U.S.]], and [[Italy]].
The tropical forest region to the east of the mountains remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3% of the population.

Although the constitution demands that 30% of gross revenue be dedicated to education, the government’s stated goal is to dedicate 11% of the budget. It is estimated that [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) spending will reach 4% in 2003. The UN Children's Fund ([[UNICEF]]) places adult literacy at 90%, but notes that this rate has been stagnant for more than ten years. The UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reports that only 87% of the primary school teachers and 72% of high school teachers have received training. The public education system is tuition-free, and attendance is mandatory from ages five to fourteen. However, the Ministry of Education reports that only 10% of five year olds actually have access to daily education and that only 66% of youngsters finish six years of schooling. In rural areas, only 10% of the youngsters go on to high school. Ministry statistics give the mean number of years completed as 6.7. Ecuador has sixty one universities, many of which now offer graduate degrees, although only 18% of the faculty in public universities possess graduate degrees themselves. Public universities have an open admissions policy, but some departments have recently implemented admissions standards. The new Board of Higher Education (CONESUP) is working to promote the introduction of teacher evaluation and a national accreditation system. There are also more than 300 Higher Institutes, offering two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training. The Higher Education Reform Act transferred oversight of these poorly regulated institutes from the Ministry of Education to the CONESUP.

== مذهب ==
[[دوتنه:Quito_SF.jpg|thumb|200px|Iglesia de San Francisco, [[Quito]], Ecuador]]
Around 68% of Ecuadorians are [[Roman Catholic]]. Not much of the population is practicing and attends mass regularly. In the rural parts of Ecuador indigenous beliefs and [[Christianity]] have been syncretized.

Like every Latin American nation, [[Protestant]] Evangelicalism has had massive growth, especially in the rural poor areas, though it has been met by many who are reluctant to convert. Other [[Christian]] groups like [[Jehovah's Witness]] number 50,843 (as of 2005) and is growing. [[Mormons]] have also seen increasing numbers.

There is a small [[Muslim]] minority numbering a couple of thousand. The [[Jew]]ish community numbers just over 1,000 individuals and is mostly of [[Germany|German]] origin.

== کلتور/فرهڼ ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Ecuador]]''

Ecuador's mainstream [[culture]] is defined by Ecuador's [[mestizo]] majority and, like their ancestry, is a mixture of [[Europe]]an and [[Amerindian]] influences infused with [[African]] elements inherited from [[Slavery|slave]] ancestors. Ecuador's indigenous communities are largely integrated into that mainstream culture to varying degrees, but some may also practise their own autochthonous cultures, particularly the more remote indigenous communities of the [[Amazon basin]].

Notable people born in Ecuador include painters [[Enrique Tábara|Tábara]], [[Guayasamín]], [[Kingman]], [[Manuel Rendon|Rendón]], [[Arauz]], [[Constanté]], [[Viteri]], [[Molinari]], [[Maldonado]], [[Judith Gutierrez|Gutierrez]], [[Gonzalo Endara Crow|Endara Crow]], [[Villacís]], [[Camilo Egas|Egas]], [[Villafuerte]] and [[Mena Franco]]; animator [[Mike Judge]]; poet and statesman [[José Joaquín de Olmedo]], scholar [[Benjamín Urrutia]], tennis player [[Pancho Segura]], speed-walker and Olympic gold medalist [[Jefferson Pérez]], and Singer [[Christina Aguilera]].

The [[Waorani]] tribe (located in Ecuador) will be heavily portrayed in the 2006 theatrical release of "The [[End of the Spear]]," the story about five missionaries speared to death, as told through the eyes of a Waorani tribesman.

The film ''[[Proof of Life]]'' (2000), starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Russell Crowe]], was filmed in Ecuador. The film, nontheless, takes place in a fictitious South American country named 'Tecala'. The guerrilla movement depicted in the film is reminiscent of [[Peru]]'s [[Shining Path]] or [[Colombia]]'s [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]].

The 2005 film ''Crónicas'', starring [[John Leguizamo]] in his Spanish-language debut, is set and filmed entirely in Ecuador.

The 1980s film ''[[Vibes]]'', starring [[Cyndi Lauper]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]], was also shot in Ecuador. The Andean cities served as a backdrop for the film.
