'''Islam Abduganievich Karimov''' (in modern [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]:  '''Islom Karimov''', [[Russian language|Russian]]: Ислам Абдуганиевич Каримов) (born [[January 30]], [[1938]]) has been the President of [[Uzbekistan]] since [[1991]].

Karimov was born in [[Samarkand]] to an Uzbek father and a Tajik mother, and was raised in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state [[orphanage]]. After studying [[engineering]] and [[economics]] in [[Tashkent]], he became an official in the [[Communist Party of the USSR|Communist Party]].

He came to power as the party's First Secretary in Uzbekistan in [[1989]]. On [[March 24]], [[1990]] Karimov became President of the [[Uzbek SSR|Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. He declared the independence of Uzbekistan on [[August 31]], [[1991]] and won elections held on [[December 29]] of that year with 86% of the vote. The elections have been called unfair, with state-run propaganda and a falsified vote count, although the opposing candidate and leader of the [http://www.uzbekistanerk.org Erk] (Freedom) Party, [[Muhammad Solih]], had a chance to participate. Shortly after the elections, a harsh political clampdown forced opposition leaders into exile, while many have been issued long-term prison sentences and a few have disappeared.

In [[1995]], Karimov extended his term until [[2000]] through a widely criticized [[referendum]], and he was reelected with 91.9% of the vote on [[January 9]], [[2000]]. The [[United States]] said that this election "was neither free nor fair and offered Uzbekistan's voters no true choice" [http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/election/uzbekistan/bbu260100.htm]. The sole opposition candidate, Abdulhasiz Dzhalalov, admitted that he had only entered the race to make it appear to be a democratic contest and that he had actually cast his own vote for Karimov. On [[January 27]], [[2002]], Karimov won another referendum extending the length of presidential terms from five to seven years; Karimov's present term, formerly due to end in [[2005]], was subsequently extended by parliament, which scheduled the next elections for December [[2007]].

Karimov's record on [[human rights]] and [[press freedom]] has met with considerable criticism in the international community. In particular, outspoken former British Ambassador in Uzbekistan [[Craig Murray]] has pointed to reports of Karimov's regime [[boiling to death|boiling people to death]], and the [[United Nations]] has found [[torture]] "institutionalized, systematic, and rampant" in Uzbekistan's justice system.

Karimov is fighting against [[Islamism|Islamist]] rebels trying to overthrow his [[secularist]] government, and who are believed to be responsible for bombings that occurred in late [[March 2004]]. He had sentenced [[Tohir Yuldashev]] and [[Juma Khodjiev]] (also known as Juma Namangani), the leader of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] (IMU), to death ''[[in absentia]]''. Namangani is said to have been killed in [[Afghanistan]], but Yuldashev, who is said to have merged the IMU into the [[Islamic Movement of Central Asia]] by [[2003]], is still at large.  Citizens accused of links to outlawed Islamic organizations such as [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] are routinely arrested and tortured.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Karimov's Uzbekistan was considered a strategic ally in the US's [[war on terrorism]] because of a mutual opposition to regional Islamists. The country hosted a 800-strong US troop presence at the [[Karshi-Khanabad]] [[Karshi-Khanabad air base|air base]] (also known as "K2"), which supported US-led efforts in the [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan war]]. This move faced some criticism by opponents of Bush as well as human rights groups critical of Karimov's regime, who claimed that Bush was subordinating the promotion of human rights to other interests. Relations with the US soured in [[2005]], however, and plans to vacate the K2 base were cemented after the Bush administration's harshly critical response to [[May 2005 unrest in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan's violent crackdown on protestors]] in May of that year.

Karimov is married; his wife, [[Tatyana Akbarovna Karimova]], is an economist. They have two daughters and three grandchildren. His elder daughter, [[Gulnara Karimova]], serves as an advisor for Uzbekistan's ambassador to [[Russia]] and is believed to have built an extensive business empire that includes the largest wireless telephone operator in Uzbekistan, night clubs, and a large cement factory.
