The '''Republic of Haiti''' is a country situated on the western third of the Caribbean island [[Hispaniola]] and also includes the smaller islands of La Gonâve, La Tortue ([[Tortuga]]), Les Cayemites, Île à Vache, La Grande Caye, and Navasa. Haiti shares Hispaniola with the [[Dominican Republic]]. The total area of Haiti is 10,714 [[square mile]]s (27,750&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]]) and its capital is [[Port-au-Prince]] on the main island of Hispaniola.

A former [[French colonization of the Americas|French colony]], it became the second independent country in [[the Americas]] (after the [[United States]]) when it declared its independence in 1804.  It was also the first independent black republic in the world.  In spite of its longevity, it is the most [[impoverished]] nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Haiti is currently in a state of transition following a coup d'état (''see'' [[2004 Haiti rebellion]]) which deposed President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] on [[February 29]], [[2004]]; he had been re-elected in [[2000]] in an election which several opposition parties boycotted due to disputes with the vote counting of the parlimentary elections.

== تاريخ ==
''Main article: [[History of Haiti]]''

The island of [[Hispaniola]], of which Haiti occupies the western third, originally inhaibited by [[Taino]] and [[Arawak]], was claimed for Spain by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492. In 1697 [[Spain]] ceded the western third of Hispanola to [[France]]. French settlers imported African slaves whose descendants became most of the population. The colony was ruled by a small minority of Europeans and mulattos. In 1796, stimulated by the ideals of the French revolution, the slaves revolted, and after prolonged fighting Haiti became the first black independent republic in 1804. 

Haiti has always been one of the poorest countries in the Americas. Much of this is due to post-independence schemes of the former colonial power- France. In 1838, the French agreed to recognize Haitian independence under the condition that Haiti pay 150 million francs (worth several billion dollars today) as an indemnity for the loss suffered by French slave owners in the loss of their slaves and plantations. Unable to make payments, Haiti, in an attempt to win international acceptance, was forced to seek loans totaling some seventy million francs. Not until 1862 did the United States finally recognize Haiti as a sovereign nation, and send diplomatic representation. Through the 19th century it was ruled by a series of dictators of varying degrees of incompetence. The outside world took little notice until 1915, when the country's unpayable debt led to [[United States occupation of Haiti (1915-1934)|American occupation]]. The US introduced a constitution (written by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and other reforms.  That said, the occupation also had many long-lasting (and oft-regarded as ill) effects on the country--most notably centralization of government and industry from the provices to the capital (which resulted in the rural exodus which continues today).  Additionally the occupation resulted in the creation of an American-trained National Army which in future decades would be said to commit many atrocities against its own people.  The occupation began dissolving in the late 1920's and ended with complete American troop withdrawal in 1934. 

The Americans left Haiti in the hands of the mulatto minority, but in 1946 [[Dumarsais Estimé]] became the country's first black president. His efforts at reform sparked disorders and a coup in 1950, followed by renewed dictatorship. In 1957 Dr [[François Duvalier]] ("Papa Doc") came to power and established a personal dictatorship which lasted until his death in 1971, when he was succeeded by his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] ("Baby Doc"). The younger Duvalier was deposed in 1986, ushering in a new period of upheaval. 

The charismatic black leader [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] was elected President in 1991, but deposed in a coup shortly after.  There followed three years of brutal control by a military junta, which spawned a renewed American occupation in 1994 that ultimately returned Aristide to power. He was succeeded by [[René Préval]] in 1996, but returned to office in 2001 after elections regarded by some as rigged. In February 2004 he was again overthrown. 

In the wake of Aristide's removal, Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Boniface Alexandre]] succeeded to the Presidency in accordance with the stipulations of the [[wikisource:Constitution of Haiti|1987 constitution]]. Elections were held in February 2006, and René Préval was again elected President. See [[Haitian elections, 2006]].

== سياست ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Haiti]]''

Haiti is a [[President|presidential]] [[republic]] with elected president and National Assembly. However, some claim it to be an [[authoritarian]] government in practice. On [[29 February]] [[2004]], a [[2004 Haiti rebellion|rebellion]] culminated in the defacto resignation of President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].

The current [[Constitution of Haiti|constitution]] was introduced in [[1987]] under the administration of [[Leslie Manigat]] and is modeled on those of the [[United States]] and [[France]]. Having been either completely or partially suspended for a period of years starting in 1988, it was fully reinstated in [[1994]].

Under the [[Constitution of Haiti|constitution]], the '''president''' is the [[head of state]] and is elected by [[popular vote]] to a term of five years.  A president may be elected to a second term, but only after he has left office and a succeeding president has served a complete term.

The current interim president is [[Boniface Alexandre]], who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, succeeded [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide|President Aristide]] upon his departure, pursuant to a stipulation of the [[Constitution of Haiti|1987 constitution]].

The '''prime minister''', the [[head of government]], is appointed by the president and ratified by the National Assembly.  [[Yvon Neptune]] was prime minister from [[2002]] until the [[2004 Haiti rebellion|2004 coup]].  After his removal from office, he was replaced by an interim prime minister, [[Gérard Latortue]].

Prime Minister Latortue was chosen through an ad-hoc process not provided for in the constitution.  However, by March [[2006]], the terms of most members of the National Assembly had expired without new elections being held.  Therefore, if interim [[Boniface Alexandre|President Alexandre]] had appointed a candidate of his choosing, the candidate would have had no constitutional way of assuming office.

The first elections since the [[2004 Haiti rebellion|coup]] were held on [[Haitian elections, 2006|February 8, 2006]].  [[Rene Preval]] was declared the winner of the race for President. Legislative runoff elections for are scheduled for May.

See [[List of Presidents of Haiti]], [[Haitian elections, 2006|2006 Haitian Elections]], [[2000 Haitian Elections]], [[1995 Haitian Elections]], [[1990 Haitian Elections]], and the [[Constitution of Haiti]].

== جغرافيه ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Haiti]]''

Haiti's terrain consists mainly of rugged mountains with small coastal plains and river valleys. The east and central part is a large elevated plateau. The highest point in Haiti is Chaine de la Selle at 8,793 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (2,680&nbsp;m).  The 224 [[mile]] (360&nbsp;km) border is shared with the [[Dominican Republic]].

In 1925, Haiti was a lush island paradise, with 60% of its original forest covering the lands and mountainous regions.  Over the years, the population cut down 95% of its trees and in the process destroyed fertile farmland soils.   Erosion has been severe in the mountainous areas.  Pictures from space glaringly show the stark difference in forestation between Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic.  Charcoal production accounts for the bulk of Haitian logging. There has also been dispute between the United States and Haiti about Navassa Island which both countries claim.  The Haitian claim relies on documentation that Navassa became part of Haiti after a 1697 agreement between France and Spain that gave France the western third of Hispaniola plus nearby islands, including Navassa Island.

This deforestation led to soil erosion and flooding as seen on [[September 17]], [[2004]]. [[Hurricane Jeanne #Haiti|Tropical storm Jeanne]] skimmed the north coast of Haiti leaving 3006 people dead in flooding and mudslides, mostly in the city of [[Gonaïves]].

== اقتصاد ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Haiti]]''

Haiti remains the least-developed country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest in the world. Comparative social and economic indicators show Haiti falling behind other low-income developing countries (particularly in the hemisphere) since the 1980s. Haiti now ranks 153rd of 177 countries in the UN’s [[Human Development Index]].

About 80% of the population lives in abject poverty, making it the second poorest country in the world. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector, which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country has experienced little job creation since President [[René Préval]] took office in February [[1996]], although the [[informal economy]] is growing. Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors have denied Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Haiti]]''

Although Haiti averages about 700 people per square mile (270/km²), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys. About 95% of Haitians are of predominant African descent with Caucasian (around 10%) and Taino admixture. The rest of the population is mostly [[mulatto]], or mixed [[whites|Caucasian]]-African ancestry. A few are of [[European]] or [[Levantine]] heritage. About two thirds of the population live in rural areas. The biggest city is the capital [[Port-au-Prince]] with 2 million inhabitants, followed by [[Cap-Haïtien]] with 600,000.  Nearly all Haitians speak [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl]] (Creole), the country's  official language. [[French language|French]] is the other official language, only spoken by about 10% of the population.  [[Roman Catholicism]] is the state religion, which the majority professes.  Some have converted to [[Protestantism]].  Protestant churches of numerical strength are [[Assemblies of God|Assemblées de Dieu]], the [[Convention Baptiste d'Haïti]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], the [[Church of God (Cleveland)]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], the [[Episcopalian|Église Episcopale d'Haiti]] and the [[Mission Evangelique Baptiste du Sud-Haiti]].
