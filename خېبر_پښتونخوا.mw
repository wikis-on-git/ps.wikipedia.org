'''Khyber Pakhtunkhwa''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|خیبر پختونخوا}}}}, {{lang-ps|{{Nastaliq|خیبر  پښتونخوا}}}}), previously known as the '''North-West Frontier Province''' (see [[names of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]), is one of the four [[provinces of Pakistan]], located in the north west of the country. It borders [[Afghanistan]] to the north-west, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] to the north-east, [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] to the east, the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA) to the west and south and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] to the south-east.

The main ethnic group in the province are the [[Pashtuns]], locally referred to as ''Pakhtuns'', followed by a number of smaller ethnic groups, most notably, the [[Hazarawals]] and [[Chitralis]]. The principal language is [[Pashto language|Pashto]], locally referred to as ''Pukhto'' and the provincial capital is [[Peshawar]], locally referred to as ''Pekhawar''.

== Geography ==

Khyber Pukhtunkhwa sits primarily on the [[Iranian plateau]] and comprises the junction where the slopes of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains on the [[Eurasian plate]] give way to the Indus-watered hills approaching [[South Asia]]. This situation has led to seismic activity in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419493/Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa/249136/Geography |title=Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (province, Pakistan) :: Geography - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> The area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is compareable to the size of [[New England]].<ref>
http://www.stratfor.com/files/mmf/5/6/566d754dc7fd57ce4263e14dc24eccc80b369acd.jpg</ref>

The famous [[Khyber Pass]] links the province to Afghanistan, while the [[Kohalla Bridge]] in [[Circle Bakote]] Abbottabad is a major crossing point over the [[Jhelum River]] in the east.

The province has an area of 28,773 [[square mile|mi²]] or (74,521 [[square kilometer|km²]]). The province's main districts are  [[Bannu District|Bannu]], [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Kohistan District, Kapisa|Kohat]], [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]] [[Haripur District|Haripur]] and [[Mansehra District|Mansehra]]. [[Peshawar]] and [[Abbottabad]] are the main cities.

The region varies in topography from dry rocky areas in the south to forests and green plains in the north. The climate can be extreme with intensely hot summers to freezing cold winters. Despite these extremes in weather, agriculture remains important and viable in the area.



The hilly terrain of [[Kalam Valley|Kalam]], [[Upper Dir]], [[Naran Valley|Naran]] and [[Kaghan Valley|Kaghan]] is renowned for its beauty and attracts a great many tourists from neighbouring regions and from around the world. Kalam is also termed 'a piece of [[Switzerland]]' as there are many landscape similarities between it and the mountainous terrain of Switzerland.

According to the 1998 census, the population of the province was approximately 17 million.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nwfpbos.sdnpk.org/nwfpds/2000/5.htm|title= District wise area and population of Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa}}</ref> of whom 52% are males and 48% are females. The density of population is 187 per km² and the intercensal change of population is of about 30%. Geographically the province could be divided into two zones: the northern one extending from the ranges of the [[Hindu Kush]] to the borders of Peshawar basin, and the southern one extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin.

The northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of Peshawar basin, which is hot in summer and cold in winter. It has moderate rainfall. The southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scanty rainfall.

The major rivers that criss-cross the province are Kabul River, Swat River, Chitral River, Kunhar River, Siran River, Panjgora River, Bara River, Kurram River, Dor River, Haroo River, Gomal River and Zhob River.

Its snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys of unusual beauty have enormous potential for tourism .

== Climate ==
The [[climate]] of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa varies immensely for a region of its size, encompassing most of the many climate types found in Pakistan. The province stretching southwards from the [[Baroghil Pass]] in the [[Hindu Kush]] covers almost six degrees of latitude; it is mainly a mountainous region. Dera Ismail Khan is one of the hottest places in the South Asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is temperate in the summer and intensely cold in the winter. The air is generally very dry and consequently the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_153.gif |title=North-West Frontier Province - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 147 |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

Rainfall also varies widely. Although large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are typically dry, the province also contains the wettest parts of Pakistan in its eastern fringe.

Three main climatic regions can be distinguished within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa:

=== Chitral District ===
[[Chitral District]] lies completely sheltered from the [[monsoon]] that controls the weather in eastern Pakistan, owing to its relatively westerly location and the shielding effect of the [[Nanga Parbat]] massif. In many ways Chitral District has more in common regarding climate with [[Central Asia]] than South Asia.<ref>Mock, John and O‘Neil, Kimberley; '''Trekking in the Karakoram and Hindukush'''; p. 15 ISBN 0-86442-360-8</ref> The winters are generally cold even in the valleys, and heavy [[snow]] during the winter blocks passes and isolates the region from the world. In the valleys, however, summers can be hotter than on the windward side of the mountains due to lower cloud cover: Chitral can reach {{convert|40|C|F}} frequently during this period.<ref>Mock and O‘Neil; '''Trekking in the Karakoram and Hindukush'''; pp. 18-19</ref>

Most precipitation falls as thunderstorms or snow during winter and spring. Summers are extremely dry in the north of Chitral district and receive only a little rain in the south around [[Drosh]].


=== Central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ===
On the southern flanks of [[Nanga Parbat]] and in [[Dir District]], rainfall is much heavier because moist winds from the [[Arabian Sea]] are able to penetrate the region. This also has the effect of making the winters milder than in shielded Chitral because cold air from [[Siberia]] does not penetrate. [[Snow]] remains very frequent at high altitudes but rarely lasts long on the ground in the major towns and agricultural areas, whilst the [[monsoon]], although short, is generally powerful and as a result this region is the wettest part of Pakistan. Annual rainfall ranges from around {{convert|500|mm|in}} in the most sheltered areas to as much as {{convert|1750|mm|in}} in parts of Abbottabad and Mansehra Districts.

The seasonality of rainfall in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shows very marked gradients from east to west. At Dir, March remains the wettest month due to frequent frontal cloudbands, whereas in Hazara more than half the rainfall comes from the monsoon.<ref>See Wernsted, Frederick L.; '''World Climatic Data'''; published 1972 by Climatic Data Press; 522 p. 31 cm.</ref> This creates a unique situation characterised by a bimodal rainfall regime, which extends into the southern part of the province described below.<ref>Ibid</ref>

=== Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ===
As one moves further away from the foothills of the Himalaya and Krarkoram ranges, the climate changes from the humid climate of the foothills to the typically [[arid climate]] of [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and southern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. As in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the seasonality of precipitation shows a very sharp gradient from west to east, but the whole region very rarely receives significant monsoonal rains.

Temperatures in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are extremely hot: Dera Ismail Khan in the southernmost district of the province is known as one of the hottest places in the world with temperatures known to have reached {{convert|50|C|F}}. In the cooler months, however, nights can be cold and frosts remain frequent, though snow is very rare.

The province has an estimated population of roughly 21 million - not including the almost 1.5 million [[Afghan refugees]]<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/481856844.html |title=Pakistani TV delves into lives of Afghan refugees |publisher=UNHCR |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> and their descendants.<ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056228 |title=Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2010-05-25}}

[[Pashto language|Pashto]] is the most pervasive language while [[Hindko]] is the second most commonly spoken indigenous language with many dialects. Pashto is predominant in western and southern parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and is the main language in most cities and towns including Peshawar. With an estimated 7.0 million ethnic Pashtuns, Karachi hosts one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world.

[[Hindko]] is mostly spoken in eastern parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the [[Hazara Division]], and especially in the cities of [[Abbottabad]], [[Mansehra]], and [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]].
 
In most rural areas of the centre and south various Pashtun tribes can be found including the [[Yousafzai|Yusufzai]], [[Daavi]], [[Khattak]], [[Babar]], [[Gharghasht]], [[Marwat]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]], [[Tanoli]], [[Shinwari tribe|Shinwari]], [[Orakzai]], [[Bangash]], [[Mahsud]], [[Mohmand]], [[Wazir (Tribe)|Wazir]], and [[Gandapur]] as well as numerous other tribes of [[Hazara]] division.

Further north, the prominent Pashtun tribes are, [[Swati (tribe)|Swati]], [[Kakar]], [[Tareen]], [[Jadoon]] and [[Mashwani]]. There are various non-Pashtun tribes including [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]], [[Turks]], [[Gujjar]], [[Karlal]], [[Rajpoot]], [[Awan]], [[Dhund Abbasi]], [[Syed]], [[Kashmiri]], [[Qureshi]] and [[Sarrara]].

The mountainous extreme north includes the [[Chitral]] and [[Kohistan District, Kapisa|Kohistan]] districts that are home to diverse [[Dardic ethnic groups]] such as the [[Khowar]], [[Kohistani]], [[Shina people|Shina]], [[Torwali]], [[Kalasha of Chitral|Kalasha]] and [[Kalami]].

However in the southern-most district live some of the Baloch tribe: [[Kori]], [[Buzdar]], [[Kunara]], [[Leghari]], [[Rind]] and some other sub tribes of Lashari tribe. These Baloch tribes speak [[Saraiki]] as their first language. In this southern district, most of its population speaks [[Saraiki]].

In addition, [[Afghan refugees]], although predominantly Pashtun (including the [[Ghilzai]] and [[Durrani]] tribes), include thousands of [[Dari (Persian)|Persian]]-speaking [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] as well as other smaller groups found throughout the province.

Nearly all of the inhabitants of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa profess [[Islam]], with a [[Sunni]] majority and significant minorities of [[Shia]]s and [[Ismaili]]s. Many of the [[Kalasha of Chitral|Kalasha]] of Southern Chitral still retain their ancient [[Animist]]/[[Shamanist]] religion.

=== Ancient history ===
Since ancient times the region numerous groups have invaded Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa including the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Huns]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughals]],[[Sikhs]], and the [[British Empire|British]]. Between 2000 and 1500 BC, the [[Indo-Iranian peoples|Aryans]] split off into an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|Iranian branch]], represented by the [[Pashtuns]] who came to dominate most of the region, an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] branch represented by the [[Hindkowans]] who populated much of the region before the time of the [[Pashtuns]] and various [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] peoples who came to populate much of the north. Earlier pre-Aryan inhabitants include the [[Burusho]].

The Vale of Peshawar was home to the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]] from around the 6th century BC and later ancient [[Peshawar]] became a capital of the [[Kushan Empire]]. The region was visited by such notable historical figures as [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Hsuan Tsang]], [[Fa Hsien]], [[Marco Polo]], and [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], among others.
Following the [[Mauryan]] conquest of the region, [[Buddhism]] became a major faith, at least in urban centres, as attested by recent archaeological and hermeneutic evidence. [[Kanishka]], a prominent [[Kushan]] ruler was one of the prominent Buddhist kings.

{{cquote|The region of Gandhara has long been known as a major centre of Buddhist art and culture around the beginning of the Christian era. But until recently, the Buddhist literature of this region was almost entirely lost. Now, within the last decade, a large corpus of Gandharan manuscripts dating from as early as the 1st century A.D. has come to light and is being studied and published by scholars at the [[University of Washington]]. These scrolls, written on birch-bark in the Gandharan language and the [[Kharosthi]] script, are the oldest surviving Buddhist literature, which has hitherto been known to us only from later and modern Buddhist canons. They also institute a missing link between original South Asian Buddhism and the Buddhism of East Asia, which was exported primarily from Gandhara along the Silk Roads through Central Asia and thence to China.<ref>Lecture: " Rediscovering the lost Buddhist literature of Gandhara" by Prof. Richard Salomon, University of Washington, Seattle at [[Stanford University]] (2005)</ref>}}

Rural areas retained numerous [[Shamanistic]] faiths as evident with the [[Kalash]] and other groups. The roots of [[Pashtunwali]] or the traditional code of honour followed by the Pashtuns is also believed to have [[Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan|Pre-Islamic]] origins. Persian invasions left small pockets of [[Zoroastrians]] and, later, a ruling [[Hindu]] elite established itself briefly during the later [[Shahi]] period.

=== The Shahi era ===
During the early [[1st millennium]], prior to the rise of [[Muslim conquests|Islam]], Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was ruled by the Shahi kings. The early Shahis were Buddhist rulers and reigned over the area until 870 CE when they were overthrown and then later replaced.

When the Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]] visited the region early in the 7th century CE, the Kabul valley region was still ruled by affiliates of the Shahi kings, who is identified as the Shahi Khingal, and whose name has been found in an inscription found in [[Gardez]].

While the early Shahis were [[Turko-Iranian]] and [[Kabulistan]]i in origin, the later Shahi kings of Kabul and Gandhara were [[Hindu]] and may have had links to some ruling families in neighbouring Kashmir and the Punjab. The Hindu Shahis are believed to have been a ruling elite of a predominantly Buddhist, Hindu and shamanistic population and were thus patrons of numerous faiths, and various artefacts and coins from their rule have been found that display their multicultural domain.

The last Shahi rulers were eventually wiped out by tribes led by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] who arrived from Afghanistan early in the 11th century.

=== Arrival of Islam ===
[[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Shamanism]] remained prominent in the region until [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Muslim Arabs]] and [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] conquered the area before the 2nd millennium CE. Over the centuries local [[Pashtun]] and Dardic tribes converted to Islam, while retaining some local traditions (albeit altered by Islam) such as [[Pashtunwali]] or the Pashtun code of honour.

==== Ghaznavid Empire ====
During 963–1187 AD, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa became part of larger Islamic empires including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], headed by Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and the empire of [[Muhammad Shahabuddin Ghauri]]. It Included Afghanistan extending up to Punjab and India Subcontinent and with its capital at [[Lahore]].

Later it was controlled by the Afghan Pashtun Muslims of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The "Delhi Sultanate" refers to the many [[Muslim]] states that ruled the [[Hindustan|India]] from 1206 to 1526.

Several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] dynasties ruled from Delhi Capital instead of Lahore : the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]] (1206–90), the [[Khilji dynasty]] (1290–1320), the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320–1413), the [[Sayyid dynasty]] (1414–51), and the [[Lodhi dynasty]] (1451–1526).

==== Mughal Empire ====
In 1526 the Delhi Sultanate was absorbed by the emerging [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Ilkhanate]] Empire of the [[Turks]], coming from Great [[Timur Lang]] and his grandsons like [[Babur]] the Mughal Dynasty.

Muslim technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, teachers, theologians and [[sufis]] flocked from the rest of the Muslim world to the region and Islam flourished because of these Northern Afghan and Central Asian invaders.

=== Afghan control ===
The area formed part of the [[Durrani Empire]] founded by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in 1747. Ahmed Shah Durrani was born in [[Multan]] which was at that time part of [[Afghanistan]]. The empire included [[Bahwalpur]], [[Kashmir]], [[Gilgit]], [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] with its main city [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]]. Under Ahmed Shah Durrani and later his son [[Timur Shah]], who ruled from Lahore and Multan, but later shifted it back to [[Kandahar]].

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was an important [[greater iran|iranian]] borderland that was often contested by the Mughals and [[Safavids]] who considered it part of their land. During the reign of the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]], Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa required formidable military forces to control and the emergence of [[Pashtun]] nationalism, who opposed Mughals who were trying to infiltrate it from India across the [[Indus River]]. A leading force in inspiring Pashtun miltancy was the local warrier poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] who united some of the tribes against the various empires around the region.

As the Mughal had lost control by 1757, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa came under the control of the Amir of Afghanistan [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]].

=== Sikh rule ===

Most of the region referred to in the twenty first century as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa came under Sikh rule in the first half of the nineteenth century, when the [[Sikhs]] defeated the [[Pashtun people|Afghans]].<ref>Nalwa, V. (2009), ''Hari Singh Nalwa - Champion of Khalsaji'', New Delhi: Manohar, pp. 77-104, ISBN 81-7304-785-5.</ref> 

The Afghans governed [[Hazara-i-Karlugh]], [[Gandhgarh]] and the [[Gakhar]] territory from [[Attock]]; while [[Kashmir]] collected the revenue from the upper regions of [[Pakhli]], [[Damtaur]] and [[Darband]]. In 1813, the Sikhs conquered the [[fort of Attock]], at which time lower Hazara became tributary to them. Upper Hazara shared the same fate in 1819, when the Sikhs conquered Kashmir. The territory referred to as Hazara formed when [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] bestowed the area as a ''jagir'' on [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], Commander-in-Chief of the Sikh army, in 1822.<ref>Nalwa, V. (2009), ''Hari Singh Nalwa - Champion of Khalsaji'', New Delhi: Manohar, p. 102, ISBN 81-7304-785-5.</ref>  

The Sikhs forayed into [[Peshawar]] for the first time in 1818, but did not occupy the territory. In 1823, following the [[Battle of Naushehra]] on the banks of the [[Kabul river]], Hari Singh Nalwa and his men chased the Afghans first to Peshawar and then to the mouth of the [[Khyber Pass]]. The Sikhs entered the city of Peshawar for a second time, once again affirming to hold Peshawar as a tributary to the Sikh Court of [[Lahore]]. After plundering the city they burnt its fortress, the [[Bala Hissar]].<ref>National Archives of India, Foreign Secret Consultation, 29-10-1824: 9.</ref>
The Sikh occupation of Peshawar in 1834, was executed in a most unusual manner.<ref>Masson, Charles. 1842. ''Narrative of Various Journeys in Balochistan, Afghanistan and the Panjab'', London: Richard Bentley, v.3, 224-9.
</ref> By 1836, with the conquest of [[Jamrud]] the frontier of the Sikh Kingdom bordered the foothills of the [[Hindu Kush Mountains]] and the Khyber Pass formed its western boundary.<ref>National Archives of India, Foreign Secret Consultation, 6-3-1837: 14</ref>. However the death of sikh general [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] at [[Battle of Jamrud]] spelt a blow to sikh forward advance policy and their wish to conquer Kabul. The death of king Ranjith Singh in 1839 plunged the sikh kingdom into turmoil and after the loss in 2 [[Anglo-Sikh wars]], British took direct control of the region.
 
The most significant contributions of Sikh rule to this region were the city of [[Haripur]], the first planned city in this entire region, and the forts of [[Sumergarh]] (Bala Hissar, Peshawar) and [[Fatehgarh]] (Fort of Jamrud at the mouth of the Khyber Pass).<ref>Nalwa, V.

=== The British Raj and the Durand Line Agreement ===
{{Main|Durand Line}}
[[دوتنه:Afghanmap1893.JPG|thumb|250px|Afghanistan before the [[Durand Line|Durand agreement]] of 1893.]]
[[دوتنه:Shabkadr Fort outside Peshawar attacked by tribesmen.jpg|thumb|250px|Afghan tribesmen attacking the British-held [[Siege of Malakand|Shabkadr Fort]] outside Peshawar in 1897]]

The British, who had captured most of the subcontinent without significant problems,{{Dubious|date=March 2010}} faced a number of difficulties here. However, crossing the [[Indus River]] on to the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Pashtun]] territory which lay there gave them a new type of challenge. The [[Pashtun]]s, strong in their belief that they must defend their land from foreign incursion resisted the British advancement. The first war between British and the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] resulted in a devastating defeat for the British, with just one individual, Dr. [[William Brydon]] coming back alive (out of a total of 14,800-21,000 people). This happened during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1849 and later the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1876. The [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1919, was also a continuation of the fight for Reclaiming Areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and claiming independence from British occupation efforts which the [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghans]] or the Pashtuns resisted with greatest zeal and effort to remain as independent nation.

Unable to enforce their rule and invade these territories fully in the region, the British changed their tactics and played a game of [[divide and rule]]. They exploited religious differences, installed puppet Pashtun rulers, divided the Pashtuns through artificially-created regions, and ruled indirectly to reduce the chance of confrontation between Pashtuns and themselves. Although the smallest size province Pushtoons were divided into [[Provincially Administered Tribal Areas]] (PATA), [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA), [[Frontier Regions]] (FR) and Settled Areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]]. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was restricted to five districts.

Occasional Pashtun resistance and attacks did take place on British in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including the [[Siege of Malakand]] and [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]], both well documented by [[Winston Churchill]] who was a war correspondent at the time.

A series of conflicts known as the [[Anglo-Afghan War (disambiguation)|Anglo-Afghan Wars]] during the imperialist [[The Great Game|Great Game]], wars between the British and [[Russia]]n governments, led to the eventual dismemberment of Afghanistan into Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. Divide and rule policy and the annexation of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan region led to the demarcation of the Durand Line and administration as part of British South Asia.

The Durand line is a poorly marked {{convert|1519|mi|km|0|sing=on}} border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. After fighting in two wars against Afghans, the British succeeded in 1893 in imposing the Durand line, dividing Afghanistan from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Baluchistan, FR regions, FATA which were incorporated into what was then [[British Raj|British India]]. It was agreed upon by representatives of both governments.

The international boundary line separating two countries was named after Sir [[Mortimer Durand]], foreign secretary of the British colonial government, who in 1893 had negotiated with [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the [[Amir]] of Afghanistan, on the frontier between modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Areas annexed from Afghanistan were the FATA, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan, the successor state of British India and the successor [[Iran]]ian state of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].

In 1893, Sir Mortimer Durand was sent to Kabul by the government of British India for the purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan, Iran and the Russian possessions.

The Amir showed ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation. The territorial exchanges were amicably agreed upon; the relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India.

From the British side the camp was attended by Sir Mortimer Durand and [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] the, [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] for the [[Khyber Agency]]. Afghanistan was represented by [[Sahibzada Abdul Latif]] and the Governor [[Sardar Shireendil Khan]] representing the King Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.<ref>http://www.aaiil.org/aaiil/ra/jalsa/2003/sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed100anniversary/08sahibzadazahoorahmad_sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed.
mp3</ref>

While the Afghan side greatly resented the border and viewed it as a temporary development, the British viewed it as being a permanent settlement. The North-West Frontier Province was formed on November 9, 1901, as a [[Chief Commissioner]] ruled province, the Chief Commissioner was the chief executive of the province.

He ran the administration with the help of his principal advisers and [[Civil servants]] better known as judicial and Revenue Commissioners.

The formal inauguration of the province took place five and half months later, at Shahi Bagh on April 26, 1902, on the occasion of the historical [[Durbar (court)|Darbar]] in the [[Shahi Bagh]] (Kings Garden) in the capital town of [[Peshawar]].

It was held by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] the Governor of the North-West Frontier Province. The province then comprised only five districts after dividing annexed areas from Afghanistan into FATA, Frontier Regions and the North-West Frontier Province and Southern [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]].

North-West Frontier Province districts were [[Peshawar Division|Peshawar District]], [[Hazara Division|Hazara District]], [[Kohat District]], [[Bannu District]] and the [[Dera Ismail Khan District]].

The first [[List of Governors of the North-West Frontier Province|Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province]] was [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]]. He was known as a strong administrator and he was succeeded by [[George Roos-Keppel|Ross-Keppel]], in 1908, whose contribution as a political officer was widely known amongst the tribal/frontier people.

North-West Frontier Province was raised to a full-fledged governor-ruled province in 1931 in accordance with the demand by the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]] held in 1931. It was agreed upon in the conference that the North-West Frontier Province would be raised to a governor-ruled province with its own [[Legislative Council]]. [[Ralph Griffith (governor)|Sir Ralph Griffith]] was appointed the first Governor in 1932 (having succeeded [[Stuart Pearks]] as Chief Commissioner in 1931).

Therefore, on January 25, 1932, the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] inaugurated the first North-West Frontier Province Legislative Council. The first provincial elections were held in 1937 and the independent candidate and noted British loyal civil servant [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] was elected as the province's first [[List of Chief Ministers in Pakistan|Chief Minister]].

=== After independence ===
During the early 20th century the so-called Red Shirts led by [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] agitated through Non-violence for the rights of [[Pakhtun]] areas.

Following independence, the North-West Frontier Province voted to join [[Pakistan]] in a referendum in 1947. However, Afghanistan's ''[[loya jirga]]'' of 1949 declared the Durand Line invalid, which led to border tensions with Pakistan. Afghanistan's governments have periodically refused to recognize Pakistan's inheritance of British treaties regarding the region, leading to a counter-claim by Pakistan that the original treaties, if they must be discussed, can only be held with the original signer, the Kingdom of Afghanistan, which is now defunct - essentially denying modern Afghanistan the same sort of inheritance rights that it denies Pakistan. 

During the 1950s, Afghanistan supported a secessionist movement called that failed to gain substantial support amongst the tribes of the North-West Frontier Province known as the [[Pashtunistan]] Movement. Afghanistan's refusal to recognize the Durrand Line, and its subsequent support for the Pashtunistan Movement has been cited as the main cause of tensions between the two countries that have existed since Pakistan's independence. 

After President [[Ayub Khan]] eliminated Pakistan's provinces, President [[Yahya Khan]], in 1969, abolished this "one unit" scheme and added [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]], [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]], [[Dir (princely state)|Dir]], [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]] and [[Kohistan District (Pakistan)|Kohistan]] to the new North-West Frontier Province as PATA.

=== Afghan jihad and war with USSR ===
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the North-West Frontier Province served as a major base for supplying the [[Mujahideen]], who fought the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] during the 1980s.

Following the invasion, over five million Afghan refugees poured into Pakistan, most residing in the North-West Frontier Province (as of 2007, nearly 3 million remain).

The North-West Frontier Province remained heavily influenced by events in Afghanistan. The civil war led to the rise of the [[Taliban]], which had emerged in the border region between Afghanistan, Baluchistan, PATA and FATA as a formidable political force. Following the terrorist attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the FATA and bordering North-West Frontier Province became a front-line region again, as part of the global "[[War on Terror]]".

In 2010, the name of the province was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Protests arose among the local ethnic Hazara population due to this name change, as they began to demand their own province.

== Provincial government ==
[[دوتنه:NWFP FATA.svg|thumb|250px|District map of Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas.]]
{{Main|Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa}}

The [[Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] is unicameral and consists of 124 seats of which 2% are reserved for non-Muslims and 17% for women only.

The President of Pakistan appoints a Governor as head of the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There is a directly-elected [[Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Provincial Assembly]], which has 124 elected members (including 22 seats reserved for women and 3 seats for non-Muslims). The Provincial Assembly elects a Chief Minister to act as the chief executive of the province, assisted by a cabinet of ministers.

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is divided into 24 districts, comprising 18 Settled Area Districts and 6 [[Provincially Administered Tribal Areas|Provincially Administered Tribal Area]] (PATA) Districts. The administration of the PATA districts is vested in the President of Pakistan and the Governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, by Articles 246 and 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ljcp.gov.pk/Menu%20Items/1973%20Constitution/constitution.htm| title=The Constitution| publisher=Government of Pakistan| accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's share of Pakistan's GDP has historically comprised 10.5%, although the province accounts for 11.9% of Pakistan's total population, rendering it the second-poorest province after neighboring [[Balochistan]]. The part of the economy that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa dominates is forestry, where its share has historically ranged from a low of 34.9% to a high of 81%, giving an average of 61.56%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/nps/nps5.pdf |title=Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates 1973-2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> Currently, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa accounts for 10% of Pakistan's GDP,<ref>{{cite web|last=Roman |first=David |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124237648756523343.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Pakistan's Taliban Fight Threatens Key Economic Zone - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-05-15 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> 20% of Pakistan’s mining output<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=a4Jvjhis1L70 |title=Pakistan May Need Extra Bailouts as War Hits Economy (Update2) |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> and since 1972, it has seen its economy grow in size by 3.6 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf |title=World Bank Document|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

After suffering for decades due to the fallout of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, today they are again are being targeted for totally a different situation of terrorism.

Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, Tobacco (in Swabi ), rice, sugar beets, as well as various fruits are grown in the province.

Some manufacturing and high tech investments in Peshawar has helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product. The bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to establishment of industrial zones.

Numerous workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons of various types. The province accounts for at least 78% of the [[marble]] production in Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf |title=World Bank Pakistan Growth and Export Competitiveness|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has the second lowest [[List of Pakistani Districts by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] out of all of Pakistan's provinces, at 0.607.<ref>http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/rr/rr73.pdf</ref> Furthermore, it also continues to have an image problem. Even within Pakistan it is regarded as a "radical state" due to the rise of Islamist parties to power in the province and purported support for the remnants of the [[Taliban]] who are believed by some to be hiding in the province.

The [[Awami National Party]] sought to rename the province "Pakhtunkhwa", which translates to "Land of Pakhtuns" in the [[Pashto language]]. This has been opposed by some of the non-Pashtuns, and especially from Parties Like [[Pakistan Muslim League-N]] (PML-N) and [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA). The PML-N derives its support in the province from primarily non-Pashtun [[Hazara people|Hazara]] regions. In 2010, it was announced that the province would finally have a name and this lead to a wave of protests in the Hazara region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=99951&Itemid=2 |title=Protest in Hazara continues over renaming of NWFP to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa |publisher=App.com.pk |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> On April 15, 2010, the province was officially named as "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" when Pakistan's Senate approved it with 80 Senators in favor of the name while only 12 opposed it.<ref name="rename">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/07-senate-begins-voting-on-18th-amendment-ha-02|title=NWFP officially renamed as Pakhtun HAZARA|date=15 April 2010|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn.com]]|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref>

== Folk music ==
Hindko and Pashto folk music are popular in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and has a rich tradition going back hundreds of years. The main instruments are the Rubab, mangey and harmonium.

Khowar folk music is popular in Chitral and northern Swat. The tunes of Khowar music are very different from those of Pashto and the main instrument is the Chitrali Sitar.

A form of band music composed of clarinets (surnai) and drums is popular in Chitral. It is played at polo matches and dances. The same form of band music is also played in the neighbouring [[Northern Areas]].

== Education ==
The trend towards higher education is rapidly increasing in the province and the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is home to Pakistan's foremost engineering university (Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute), which is located in Topi, a town in Swabi district. The [[University of Peshawar]] is also a notable institution of higher learning. The [[Frontier Post]] is perhaps the province's best-known newspaper and addresses many of the various issues facing the local population.

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's share of Pakistan's GDP has historically been between 10.5% to 12.1%. The part of the economy that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa dominates is forestry, where its share has historically ranged from a low of 34.9% to a high of 81%, giving an average of 61.56%.<ref>[http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/nps/nps5.pdf Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates 1973-2000]</ref> Currently, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa accounts for 10% of Pakistan's GDP,<ref>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124237648756523343.html?mod=googlenews_wsj</ref> 20% of Pakistan’s mining output<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=a4Jvjhis1L70</ref> and since 1972, it has seen its economy grow in size by 3.6 times.<ref>http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf</ref>

After suffering for decades due to the fallout of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, today they are again are being targeted for totally a different situation of terrorism. 

Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, rice, sugar beets, as well as various fruits are grown in the province. 

Some manufacturing and high tech investments in Peshawar has helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product. The bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to establishment of industrial zones.

Numerous workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons of various types. The province accounts for at least 78% of the [[marble]] production in Pakistan <ref>[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf World Bank - Pakistan Growth and Export Competitiveness]</ref>.

== Social issues ==
{{Copyedit|section|date=July 2009}}
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa continues to have an image problem. Even within Pakistan it is regarded as a "radical state" due to the rise of Islamist parties to power in the province and purported support for the remnants of the [[Taliban]] who are believed by some to be hiding in the province. 

The Awami National Party sought to rename the province "Pakhtunkhwa", which translates to "Land of Pakhtuns" in the [[Pashto language]]. This has been opposed by some of the non-Pashtuns, and especially from Parties Like [[Pakistan Muslim League-N]] (PML-N) and [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA). The PML-N derives its support in the province from primarily non-Pashtun [[Hazara]] regions. In 2010, it was announced that the province would finally have a name and this lead to a wave of protests in the Hazara region.<ref>[http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=99951&Itemid=2 Protest in Hazara continues over renaming of NWFP]</ref> On April 15, 2010, the province was officially named as "Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa" when Pakistan's Senate approved it with 80 Senators in favor of the name while only 12 opposed it.<ref>Dawn News of Pakistan, [http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/07-senate-begins-voting-on-18th-amendment-ha-02 NWFP officially renamed as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]</ref>

The MMA, who until the elections of 2008, had a majority in the NWFP government, proposed ''Afghania'' as a compromise name. It has been suggested that the religious parties' power-bases in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], are a central reason for opposing an ethnically-based alternative name for NWFP.<ref>{{cite web | title = MMA govt proposes new name for NWFP | publisher= Dawn | url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/08/01/top11.htm}}</ref>

After the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|2008 general election]], the [[Awami National Party]] (ANP) formed a coalition provincial government with the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], and is supporting the PPP government in the centre and other provinces.<ref>Abbas, Hassan. "Peace in FATA: ANP Can Be Counted On." Statesman (Pakistan) (2007 Feb 4).</ref>

The strongholds of ANP are in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan, particularly in the [[Peshawar]] valley of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, while [[Karachi]] in [[Sindh]] has one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world with around 7 million by some estimates.<ref>[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]: [http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2009/07/karachis_invisi.html Pakistan: Karachi's Invisible Enemy City potent refuge for Taliban fighters]. July 17, 2009.</ref> In the 2008 election, the ANP won two Sindh assembly seats in Karachi.

The ANP has been instrumental in fighting the Taliban who are by-products of religious parties like [[JI]] and [[JUI]] which formed the MMA.<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0505/p06s01-wosc.htm</ref>

== Folk music ==
{{Main|Music of NWFP}}
Pashto folk music is popular in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and has a rich tradition going back hundreds of years. The main instruments are the Rubab, mangey and harmonium.

Khowar folk music is popular in Chitral and northern Swat. The tunes of Khowar music are very different from those of Pashto and the main instrument is the Chitrali Sitar.

A form of band music composed of clarinets (surnai) and drums is popular in Chitral. It is played at polo matches and dances. The same form of band music is also played in the neighbouring [[Northern Areas]].

== Education ==
The trend towards higher education is rapidly increasing in the province and the NWFP is home to Pakistan's foremost engineering university (Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute), which is located in Topi, a town in Swabi district. The [[University of Peshawar]] is also a notable institution of higher learning. The [[Frontier Post]] is perhaps the province's best-known newspaper and addresses many of the various issues facing the local population.
