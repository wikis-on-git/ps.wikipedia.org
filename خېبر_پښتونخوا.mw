 is one of the [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|four provinces]] of [[Pakistan]].<ref>[http://www.ipdf.gov.pk/tmpnew/DF_NWFP.php NWFP]</ref> Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa borders [[Afghanistan]] to the north west, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] to the north east, [[Azad Kashmir]] to the east, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to the west and south, and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] to the south east. 

The main ethnic group in the province are the [[Pashtuns]], locally referred to as ''Pakhtuns'', followed by a number of smaller ethnic groups. The principal language is [[Pashto language|Pashto]], locally referred to as ''Pakhto'' and the provincial capital is [[Peshawar]], locally referred to as ''Pekhawar''.

[[Image:Pakistan nwfp siran valley 2006.jpg‎|thumb|upright|View of [[Siran Valley]] in [[Mansehra District]] (2006)]]

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is largely located at the junction where the slopes of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains on the [[Eurasian plate]] give way to the Indus-watered hills approaching [[South Asia]], and this has led to seismic activity in the past.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419493/North-West-Frontier-Province/249136/Geography</ref> Area wise, it is equal to the size of [[New England]].<ref>http://www.stratfor.com/files/mmf/5/6/566d754dc7fd57ce4263e14dc24eccc80b369acd.jpg</ref>

The famous [[Khyber Pass]] links the province to Afghanistan, while the [[Kohalla Bridge]] in [[Circle Bakote]] is a major crossing point over the [[Jhelum River]] in the east. 

The province has an area of 28,773 [[square mile|mi²]] or (74,521 [[square kilometer|km²]]) and its districts include [[Hazara Division]], home to the town of [[Havelian]], the western starting point of the [[Karakoram Highway]]. 

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa  is divided into three administrative regions areas: Settled Areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , the Tribal Areas of PATA, and the Tribal Areas of [[Frontier Regions]]. There are five Frontier Regions in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa . 

The province's main districts are [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Kohistan|Kohat]], [[Bannu District|Bannu]], [[Abbottabad District|Abbottabad]] and [[Mansehra District|Mansehra]]. [[Peshawar]] and [[Mardan]] are the main cities. 

The region varies in topography from dry rocky areas in the south to forests and green plains in the north. The climate can be extreme with intensely hot summers to freezing cold winters. Despite these extremes in weather, agriculture remains important and viable in the area. 

The hilly terrain of [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], [[Kalam]], [[Upper Dir]], [[Naran Valley|Naran]] and [[Kaghan Valley|Kaghan]] is renowned for its beauty and attracts a great many tourists from neighbouring regions and from around the world. Swat-Kalam is also termed 'a piece of [[Switzerland]]' as there are many landscape similarities between it and the mountainous terrain of Switzerland. 

According to the 1998 census, the population of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa  was approximately 17 million.<ref>[http://www.nwfpbos.sdnpk.org/nwfpds/2000/5.htm District wise area and population of NWFP]</ref>, of whom 52% are males and 48% are females. The density of population is 187 per km² and the intercensal change of population is of about 30%. Geographically the province could be divided into two zones: the northern one extending from the ranges of the [[Hindu Kush]] to the borders of Peshawar basin, and the southern one extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin. 

The northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of Peshawar basin, which is hot in summer and cold in winter. It has moderate rainfall. The southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scantly rainfall. 

Its climate varies from very cold (Chitral in the north) to very hot in places like D.I. Khan. The major rivers that criss-cross the province are Kabul River, Swat River, Chitral River, Panjgora River, Bara River, Karam River, Gomal River and Zob River.

Its snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys of unusual beauty have enormous potential for tourism .

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa varies immensely for a region of its size, most of the many climate types found in Pakistan. The province stretching southwards from the [[Baroghil Pass]] in the [[Hindu Kush]] covers almost six degrees of latitude; it is mainly a mountainous region. Dera Ismail Khan is one of the hottest places in the South Asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is temperate in the summer and intensely cold in the winter. The air is generally very dry and consequently the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large.<ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_153.gif North-West Frontier Province - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 147.]</ref> 

====Chitral District====
The north, comprising [[Chitral District]], has a typically continental steppe climate, with average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] ranging from 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;inches) per year in the far north to 585&nbsp;mm (23&nbsp;inches) in Drosh in the south.  Most of this precipitation from frontal cloudbands during the winter and heavy [[thunderstorm]]s in the spring.  Of Chitral's average 420&nbsp;mm (16.5&nbsp;inches) of rainfall per year, 350&nbsp;mm (13.8&nbsp;inches) falls from December to May.  

At high elevations in the Hindukush, [[snow]]fall can be much heavier than this and consequently large [[glaciers]] are a prominent feature of the landscape.  Snow also cuts off even [[Chitral]] from the outside world for most of the year.  Temperatures in the valleys vary from 40 °C (105 °F) in July to as low as -10 °C (15 °F) in January. In the previous few years flooding has created problems in Mastuj [[tehsil]].

====Dir, Swat and Hazara====
[[Image:Malam Jabba P1010215.jpg|thumb|250px|right||PTDC Motel at Malam Jabba Ski Resort, [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]]]]
[[Image:batgram.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of Village [[Dedal]], [[Batagram District]]]]

Further south, in the districts of [[Upper Dir|Dir]], [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] and [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], the climate becomes more typical of the South Asia, although a considerable proportion of the annual precipitation still comes from frontal cloudbands during the winter months.

The combination of a short but powerful (owing to orography) summer monsoon with frequent winter cloudbands gives a bimodal rainfall regime in central parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa,  Dir and Hazara districts are some of the wettest places in Pakistan: annual rainfall at Dir averages 1475&nbsp;mm (58&nbsp;inches), of which 400&nbsp;mm (15.75&nbsp;inches) falls during the summer monsoon from July to September and twice that amount during the winter rainy season from December to April.  

At [[Abbottabad]] further east, the annual rainfall averages about 1195&nbsp;mm (47&nbsp;inches), but as much as 635&nbsp;mm (25&nbsp;inches) falls during the south-west monsoon.  In Swat, rather more sheltered, the annual rainfall averages around 840&nbsp;mm (33&nbsp;inches), with about 430&nbsp;mm (17&nbsp;inches) expected between June and September.  A similar climate to that of Dir, though drier, prevails in a small area around [[Parachinar]] in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].

In all areas October and November are the driest months with rainfalls generally under 30&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;inches) per month except in the most exposed areas.

Temperatures in this region are somewhat warmer than in [[Chitral]], and even at {{convert|1200|m|ft|-2}} in Abbottabad the heat and humidity can be oppressive during the monsoon season. In winter, most of Swat receives significant snowfall, but in Hazara temperatures are usually around 5 °C (41 °F).

===Southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa===
This region, south of the Himalaya/Hindukush foothills, has the typically hot and dry climate of much of Pakistan.  Temperatures in summer are quite oppressively hot, and in the south around Mardan temperatures of 45 °C (113 °F) are not uncommon, whilst in Peshawar 40 °C (104 °F) is par for the course in summer.  

In winter, however, this region is both warmer and generally drier than the rest of NWFP, with temperatures being around 17 °C (62 °F) in Peshawar and over 20 °C (68 °F) in the extreme south of the province.  Nights, however, can still be quite cold during the winter.

Southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa experiences little (and very erratic) monsoonal rain, with Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan both averaging around 115&nbsp;mm (4.5&nbsp;inches) of rain in July and August and almost nothing in June or September.  Moreover, in many years no summer rain of significance occurs.  

In winter, rainfall usually peaks in March but Peshawar averages less than 250&nbsp;mm (10&nbsp;inches) between December and May and Dera Ismail Khan less than 115&nbsp;mm (4.5&nbsp;inches).  On certain mountain slopes such as around [[Kohat]], winter rainfall may predominate, though this is unpredictable.

The province has an estimated population of roughly 21 million that does not include the almost 1.5 million [[Afghan refugees]]<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/481856844.html Pakistani TV delves into lives of Afghan refugees - UNHCR]</ref> and their descendants in the province.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056228 britannica.com - North West Frontier]</ref><ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=SUBSITES&page=SUBSITES&id=434fdc702 UNHCR - Census of Afghans in Pakistan]</ref> The largest ethnic group are the [[Pashtuns]] who form about two-thirds of the population.<ref>[http://nwfp.gov.pk/AIS-page.php?DistId=1&DeptId=1&LanId=1&pageName=NWFP-PeopleCulture People and culture - Government of the North-West Frontier Province]</ref>

[[Pashto language|Pashto]] is the most pervasive language while [[Hindko]] is the second most commonly spoken indigenous language. Pashto is predominant in western and southern NWFP and is the main language in most cities and towns including Peshawar. With an estimated 7.0 million ethnic Pashtuns, Karachi hosts one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world.
  
[[Hindkowans]] are most common in eastern NWFP, the [[Hazara Division]], and especially in the cities of [[Abbottabad]], [[Mansehra]], and [[Haripur]]. [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] and [[Baloch language|Balochi]]-speakers live in the southeast of the province mainly in [[Dera Ismail Khan District]]. Bilingualism and trilingualism is common with Pashto and Urdu being the primary other languages spoken.

In most rural areas of the centre and south various Pashtun tribes can be found including the [[Yousafzai|Yusufzai]], [[Tanoli]], [[Daavi]], [[Khattak]], [[Gharghasht]], [[Marwat]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]], [[Shinwari]], [[Orakzai]], [[Bangash]], [[Mahsud]], [[Mohmand]], [[Wazir (Tribe)|Wazir]], and [[Gandapur]] as well as numerous other smaller tribes. 

Further north, the prominent Pashtun tribes are, [[Swati (tribe)|Swati]], [[Kakar]], [[Tareen]], [[Jadoon]] and [[Mashwani]]. There are various non-Pashtun tribes including [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]], Gujjar. The [[Awan]] are believed to be of Arabic origin and are recognisably different from the rest of Pashtun and non-Pushtun majority.   

[[Image:Northern Language Map.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Languages spoken in Northern Pakistan]]
The mountainous extreme north includes the [[Chitral]] and [[Kohistan]] districts that are home to diverse [[Dardic ethnic groups]] such as the [[Khowar]], [[Kohistani]], [[Shina]], [[Torwali]], [[Kalasha of Chitral|Kalasha]] and [[Kalami]].

In addition, [[Afghan refugees]], although predominantly Pashtun (including the [[Ghilzai]] and [[Durrani]] tribes), include hundreds of thousands of [[Dari (Persian)|Persian]]-speaking [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]]s as well as other smaller groups found throughout the province.

Nearly all of the inhabitants of the NWFP are [[Muslim]] with a [[Sunni]] majority and significant minority of [[Shia]]s and [[Ismaili]]s. Many of the [[Kalasha of Chitral|Kalasha]] of Southern Chitral still retain their ancient [[Animist]]/[[Shamanist]] religion.

==History==
{{Main|History of North-West Frontier Province}}
{{Move portions|History of North-West Frontier Province|discuss=Talk:North-West Frontier Province#History sections|date=April 2010}}

===Ancient history===
Since ancient times the region numerous groups have invaded the NWFP including the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Huns]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Mughals]], [[Sikhs]], and the [[British Empire|British]]. Between 2000 and 1500 BC, the [[Aryans]] split off into an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|Iranian branch]], represented by the [[Pashtuns]] who came to dominate most of the region, an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] branch represented by the [[Hindkowans]] who populated much of the region before the time of the [[Pashtuns]] and various [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] peoples who came to populate much of the north. Earlier pre-Aryan inhabitants include the [[Burusho]].

The Vale of Peshawar was home to the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]] from around the 6th century BC and later ancient [[Peshawar]] became a capital of the [[Kushan Empire]]. The region was visited by such notable historical figures as [[Darius II]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Hsuan Tsang]], [[Fa Hsien]], [[Marco Polo]], [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], and [[Winston Churchill]], among others.
According to the [[Mahabharatha]] (an Indian epic dating to 3000 BC), the Gandhara kingdom had its capital at today's Kandahar in Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The place of Shakuni Maternal Uncle of Kauravas and their mother Gandhari's Land. Following the [[Mauryan]] conquest of the region, [[Buddhism]] became a major faith, at least in urban centres, as attested by recent archaeological and hermeneutic evidence. [[Kanishka]], a prominent [[Kushan]] ruler was one of the prominent Buddhist kings. 

{{cquote|The region of Gandhara has long been known as a major centre of Buddhist art and culture around the beginning of the Christian era. But until recently, the Buddhist literature of this region was almost entirely lost. Now, within the last decade, a large corpus of Gandharan manuscripts dating from as early as the 1st century A.D. has come to light and is being studied and published by scholars at the [[University of Washington]]. These scrolls, written on birch-bark in the Gandharan language and the [[Kharosthi]] script, are the oldest surviving Buddhist literature, which has hitherto been known to us only from later and modern Buddhist canons. They also institute a missing link between original South Asian Buddhism and the Buddhism of East Asia, which was exported primarily from Gandhara along the Silk Roads through Central Asia and thence to China.<ref>Lecture: " Rediscovering the lost Buddhist literature of Gandhara" by Prof. Richard Salomon, University of Washington, Seattle at [[Stanford University]] (2005)</ref>}}

Rural areas retained numerous [[Shamanistic]] faiths as evident with the [[Kalash]] and other groups. The roots of [[Pashtunwali]] or the traditional code of honour followed by the Pashtuns is also believed to have [[Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan|Pre-Islamic]] origins. Persian invasions left small pockets of [[Zoroastrians]] and, later, a ruling [[Hindu]] elite established itself briefly during the later [[Shahi]] period.

===The Shahi era===
During the early [[1st millennium]], prior to the rise of [[Muslim conquests|Islam]], the NWFP was ruled by the Shahi kings. The early Shahis were [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] Buddhist rulers and reigned over the area until 870 CE when they were overthrown and then later replaced. 

When the Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]] visited the region early in the 7th century CE, the Kabul valley region was still ruled by affiliates of the Shahi kings, who is identified as the Shahi Khingal, and whose name has been found in an inscription found in [[Gardez]].

While the early Shahis were [[Iranian peoples|Irano-Afghan]] and Hindus [[Kabulistan]]i in origin, the later Shahi kings of Kabul and Gandhara may have had links to some ruling families in neighbouring Kashmir and the Punjab. The Hindu Shahis are believed to have been a ruling elite of a predominantly Buddhist, Hindu and shamanistic population and were thus patrons of numerous faiths, and various artefacts and coins from their rule have been found that display their multicultural domain. 

The last Shahi rulers were eventually wiped out by  tribes led by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] who arrived from Afghanistan early in the 11th century.

===Arrival of Islam===
[[Buddhism]] and [[Shamanism]] remained prominent in the region until [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Muslim Arabs]] and [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] conquered the area before the 2nd millennium CE. Over the centuries local Pashtun and Dardic tribes converted to Islam, while retaining some local traditions (albeit altered by Islam) such as [[Pashtunwali]] or the Pashtun code of honour. 

====Ghaznavid Empire====
During 963–1187 AD, NWFP became part of larger Islamic empires including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], headed by Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and the empire of [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. It Included Afghanistan extending up to Punjab and India Subcontinent and with its capital at [[Lahore]].   

Later it  was controlled by the Afghan Pashtun Muslims of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].  The "Delhi Sultanate" refers to the many [[Muslim]] states that ruled the [[Hindustan|India]] from 1206 to 1526. 

Several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] dynasties ruled from Delhi Capital instead of Lahore : the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]] (1206–90), the [[Khilji dynasty]] (1290–1320), the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320–1413), the [[Sayyid dynasty]] (1414–51), and the [[Lodhi dynasty]] (1451–1526).

====Mughal Empire====
In 1526 the Delhi Sultanate was absorbed by the emerging [[Mughal Empire]]  and the [[Ilkhanate]] Empire of the [[Mongols]], coming from Great [[Genghis Khan]] and his grandsons like [[Babur]] the [[Mughal Dynasty]]. 

Muslim technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, teachers, theologians and [[sufis]] flocked from the rest of the Muslim world to the region and Islam flourished because of these Northern Afghan and Central Asian invaders.

===Mughal Afghan Sikh and British maintain nominal control===
The area formed part of the [[Durrani Empire]] founded by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in 1747. Ahmed Shah Durrani was born in [[Multan]] which was at that time part of [[Afghanistan]]. The empire included [[Bahwalpur]], [[Kashmir]], [[Gilgit]], [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] with its main city [[Haripur]]. Under tAhmed Shah Durrani and later his son [[Timur Shah]], who ruled from Lahore and Multan, but later shifted it back to [[Kandahar]].  

The NWFP was an important borderland that was often contested by the [[Mughals]] and [[Safavids]] of [[Persia]]. During the reign of the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]], the NWFP required formidable military forces to control and the emergence of [[Pashtun]] nationalism, who opposed Mughals who had conquered most of North India. A leading force in inspiring Pashtun miltancy was the local warrier poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] who united some of the tribes against the various empires around the region. 

As the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]  had lost control by 1757, the NWFP came under the control of the Amir of Afghanistan [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. 

The [[Sikh Empire]], 1801–1849, under [[Ranjit Singh]] ruled parts of the NWFP province from 1818 until the British took over during the Anglo Sikh war of 1849. However total control was never established, there was constant rebellion and insurgency against the authority.

===The British Raj and birth of NWFP after the Durand Line Agreement===
{{Main|Durand Line}}

[[Image:Shabkadr Fort outside Peshawar attacked by tribesmen.jpg|thumb|250px|Afghan tribesmen attacking the British-held [[Siege of Malakand|Shabkadr Fort]] outside Peshawar in 1897]]

The British, who had captured most of rest of the [[Indian subcontinent]] without significant problems,{{Dubious|date=March 2010}} faced a number of difficulties here. The first war with the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] resulted in a devastating defeat, with just one Dr. [[William Brydon]] coming back alive (out of a total of 14,800-21,000 people). This happened during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1849 and later the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1876. The [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1919,  was also a continuation of the fight for Reclaiming Areas of NWFP and claiming independence from British occupation efforts which the [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghans]] or the Pashtuns resisted with greatest zeal and effort to remain as independent nation. 

Unable to enforce their rule and invade these territories fully in the region, the British changed their tactics and played a game of [[divide and rule]]. The use of religion and installing puppet Pashtun rulers and dividing the Pashtuns through artificially created regions and ruling indirectly to reduce the chance of confrontation between Pashtuns and the British. Although the smallest size province Pushtoons were divided into [[Provincially Administered Tribal Areas]] (PATA), [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA), [[Frontier Regions]] (FR) and Settled Areas of  NWFP and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]]. NWFP was restricted to five districts. 

Occasional Pashtun resistance and attacks did take place on British in NWFP, including the [[Siege of Malakand]] and [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]], both well documented by [[Winston Churchill]] who was a war correspondent at the time. 

A series of conflicts known as the [[Anglo-Afghan War]]s during the imperialist [[The Great Game|Great Game]], wars between the British and [[Russia]]n governments, led to the eventual dismemberment of Afghanistan into NWFP, [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] and [[Khurasan]]. Divide and rule policy and the annexation of  NWFP and Baluchistan region led to the demarcation of the Durand Line and administration as part of British South Asia. 

The Durand line is a poorly marked {{convert|1519|mi|km|0|sing=on}} border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. After fighting in two wars against Afghans, the British succeeded in 1893 in imposing the Durand line, dividing Afghanistan from the NWFP, Baluchistan, FR regions, FATA  which were incorporated into what was then [[British Raj|British India]]. It was agreed upon by representatives of both governments. 

The international boundary line separating two countries was named after Sir [[Mortimer Durand]], foreign secretary of the British colonial government, who in 1893 had negotiated with [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the [[Amir]] of Afghanistan, on the frontier between modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Areas annexed from Afghanistan were the FATA, NWFP and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan, the successor state of British India and the successor [[Iran]]ian state of [[Khorasan]]. 
 
In 1893, Sir Mortimer Durand was sent to Kabul by the government of British India for the purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan, Iran and the Russian possessions. 

The Amir showed ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation. The territorial exchanges were amicably agreed upon; the relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India. 

From the British side the camp was attended by Sir Mortimer Durand and [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] the, [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] for the [[Khyber Agency]]. Afghanistan was represented by [[Sahibzada Abdul Latif]] and the Governor  [[Sardar Shireendil Khan]] representing the King Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.<ref>http://www.aaiil.org/aaiil/ra/jalsa/2003/sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed100anniversary/08sahibzadazahoorahmad_sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed.

While the Afghan side greatly resented the border and viewed it as a temporary development, the British viewed it as being a permanent settlement. The NWFP Province was formed on November 9, 1901, as a [[Chief Commissioner]] ruled province, the Chief Commissioner was the chief executive of the province. 

He ran the administration with the help of his principal advisers and [[Civil servants]] better known as judicial and Revenue Commissioners. 

The formal inauguration of the province took place five and half months later, at Shahi Bagh on April 26, 1902, on the occasion of the historical [[Durbar (court)|Darbar]] in the [[Shahi Bagh]] (Kings Garden) in the capital town of [[Peshawar]]. 

It was held by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] the Governor of the NWFP. The province then comprised only five districts after dividing annexed areas from Afghanistan into FATA, Frontier Regions and the NWFP and Southern [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]].  

NWFP districts were [[Peshawar Division|Peshawar District]], [[Hazara Division|Hazara District]], [[Kohat District]], [[Bannu District]] and the [[Dera Ismail Khan District]].  

The first [[List of Governors of the North-West Frontier Province|Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province]] was [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]]. He was known as a strong administrator and he was succeeded by [[George Roos-Keppel|Ross-Keppel]], in 1908, whose contribution as a political officer was widely known amongst the tribal/frontier people. 

NWFP was raised to a full-fledged governor-ruled province in 1931 in accordance with the demand by the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]] held in 1931.  It was agreed upon in the conference that the NWFP would be raised to a governor-ruled province with its own [[Legislative Council]]. [[Ralph Griffith (governor)|Sir Ralph Griffith]] was appointed the first Governor in 1932 (having succeeded [[Stuart Pearks]] as Chief Commissioner in 1931).

Therefore, on January 25, 1932, the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] inaugurated the first NWFP Legislative Council. The first provincial elections were held in 1937 and the independent candidate and noted British loyal civil servant [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] was elected as the province's first [[List of Chief Ministers in Pakistan|Chief Minister]].

===After independence===
During the early 20th century the so-called Red Shirts led by [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] agitated through Non-violence for the rights of [[Pakhtun]] areas. 

Following independence, the NWFP voted to join [[Pakistan]] in a referendum in 1947. However, Afghanistan's ''[[loya jirga]]'' of 1949 declared the Durand Line invalid, which led to border tensions with Pakistan. 

During the 1950s, Afghanistan supported a secessionist movement called that failed to gain substantial support amongst the tribes of the NWFP known as the [[Pashtunistan]] Movement. 

After President [[Ayub Khan]] eliminated Pakistan's provinces, President [[Yahya Khan]], in 1969, abolished this "one unit" scheme and added [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]], [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]], [[Dir (princely state)|Dir]], [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]] and [[Kohistan District (Pakistan)|Kohistan]] to the new NWFP as PATA.

Following the invasion over five million Afghan refugees poured into Pakistan, most residing in the NWFP (as of 2007 nearly 3 million remain).

===Afghan jihad and war with Russia===
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the NWFP, the PATA and FATA served as a major base for supplying the [[Mujahideen]] who fought the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s during the 1980s. 

The NWFP remained heavily influenced by events in Afghanistan and the civil war led to the rise of the [[Taliban]], which had emerged in the border region between Afghanistan, Baluchistan, PATA and FATA as a formidable political force that nearly took over all of Afghanistan.  Following the terrorist attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the FATA and bordering NWFP became a front-line region again as part of the global "[[War on Terror]]".

==Provincial government==
[[Image:NWFP FATA.svg|thumb|right|250px|District map of Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas.]]
{{Main|Government of North-West Frontier Province}}
The [[Provincial Assembly of the North-West Frontier Province]] is unicameral and consists of 124 seats of which 2% are reserved for non-Muslims and 17% for women only.

===Districts===
There are 24 districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, which are divided into 18 Settled Area Districts and 6 PATA Districts. The Provincial Administered Districts are partially controlled by the central government in Islamabad through President of Pakistan and Governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. 

The Provincial Assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa does not have full authority to implement and make laws for PATA, without consent of the President of Pakistan, through Article 247 and 246 of 1973 Constitution which governs Tribal Areas of PATA and FATA:

==Economy==
[[Image:Forestry by Province.jpg|thumb|top|350px|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Dominance- Forestry]]

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's share of Pakistan's GDP has historically been between 10.5% to 12.1%. The part of the economy that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa  dominates is forestry, where its share has historically ranged from a low of 34.9% to a high of 81%, giving an average of 61.56%.<ref>[http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/nps/nps5.pdf Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates 1973-2000]</ref> Currently, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa accounts for 10% of Pakistan's GDP,<ref>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124237648756523343.html?mod=googlenews_wsj</ref> 20% of Pakistan’s mining output<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=a4Jvjhis1L70</ref> and since 1972, it has seen its economy grow in size by 3.6 times.<ref>http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf</ref>

After suffering for decades due to the fallout of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, today they are again are being targeted for totally a different situation of terrorism. 

Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, rice, sugar beets, as well as various fruits are grown in the province. 

Some manufacturing and high tech investments in Peshawar has helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product.  The bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to establishment of industrial zones.

Numerous workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons of various types. The province accounts for at least 78% of the [[marble]] production in Pakistan  <ref>[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf World Bank - Pakistan Growth and Export Competitiveness]</ref>.

==Social issues==
{{Copyedit|section|date=July 2009}}
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa  continues to have an image problem. Even within Pakistan it is regarded as a "radical state" due to the rise of Islamist parties to power in the province and purported support for the remnants of the [[Taliban]] who are believed by some to be hiding in the province. 

The Awami National Party sought to rename the province "Pakhtunkhwa", which translates to "Land of Pakhtuns" in the [[Pashto language]]. This has been opposed by some of the non-Pashtuns, and especially from Parties Like [[Pakistan Muslim League-N]] (PML-N) and [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA). The PML-N derives its support in the province from primarily non-Pashtun [[Hazara]] regions. In 2010, it was announced that the province would finally have a name and this lead to a wave of protests in the Hazara region.<ref>[http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=99951&Itemid=2 Protest in Hazara continues over renaming of NWFP]</ref> On April 15, 2010, the province was officially named as "Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa" when Pakistan's Senate approved it with 80 Senators in favor of the name while only 12 opposed it.<ref>Dawn News of Pakistan, [http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/07-senate-begins-voting-on-18th-amendment-ha-02 NWFP officially renamed as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]</ref>

The MMA, who until the elections of 2008, had a majority in the NWFP government, proposed ''Afghania'' as a compromise name. It has been suggested that the religious parties' power-bases in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], are a central reason for opposing an ethnically-based alternative name for NWFP.<ref>{{cite web | title = MMA govt proposes new name for NWFP | publisher= Dawn | url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/08/01/top11.htm}}</ref>

After the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|2008 general election]], the [[Awami National Party]] (ANP) formed a coalition provincial government with the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], and is supporting the PPP government in the centre and other provinces.<ref>Abbas, Hassan. "Peace in FATA: ANP Can Be Counted On." Statesman (Pakistan) (2007 Feb 4).</ref>

The strongholds of ANP are in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan, particularly in the [[Peshawar]] valley of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, while [[Karachi]] in [[Sindh]] has one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world with around 7 million by some estimates.<ref>[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]: [http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2009/07/karachis_invisi.html Pakistan: Karachi's Invisible Enemy City potent refuge for Taliban fighters]. July 17, 2009.</ref> In the 2008 election, the ANP won two Sindh assembly seats in Karachi.

The ANP has been instrumental in fighting the Taliban who are by-products of religious parties like [[JI]] and [[JUI]] which formed the MMA.<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0505/p06s01-wosc.htm</ref>

==Folk music==
{{Main|Music of NWFP}}
Pashto folk music is popular in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and has a rich tradition going back hundreds of years. The main instruments are the Rubab, mangey and harmonium.

Khowar folk music is popular in Chitral and northern Swat. The tunes of Khowar music are very different from those of Pashto and the main instrument is the Chitrali Sitar.

A form of band music composed of clarinets (surnai) and drums is popular in Chitral. It is played at polo matches and dances. The same form of band music is also played in the neighbouring [[Northern Areas]].

==Education==
The trend towards higher education is rapidly increasing in the province and the NWFP is home to Pakistan's foremost engineering university (Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute), which is located in Topi, a town in Swabi district. The [[University of Peshawar]] is also a notable institution of higher learning. The [[Frontier Post]] is perhaps the province's best-known newspaper and addresses many of the various issues facing the local population.
