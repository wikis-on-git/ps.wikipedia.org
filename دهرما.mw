'''دهرما''' ([[سانسيکرت]] '''&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;''') يا '''دهما''' ([[Pāli]]) په مانا د '''طبعي قانون''' يا '''حقيقت''', and with respect to its significance for [[spirituality]] and [[religion]] might be considered '''the Way of the Higher Truths'''. Dharma forms the basis for philosophies, beliefs and practices originating in [[India]]. The four main ones are [[Hinduism]] ([[Sanatana Dharma]]), [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]] all retain the centrality of Dharma. In these traditions, beings that live in harmony with '''Dharma''' proceed more quickly towards  [[Dharma Yukam]], [[Moksha]], [[Nirvana]] (personal [[liberation]]). Dharma also refers to the teachings and doctrines of the various founders of the traditions, such as [[Gautama Buddha]] in Buddhism and [[Mahavira]] in Jainism. As the religious and moral doctrine of the rights and duties of each individual, Dharma can refer generally to religious [[duty]], and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue.

==Meanings and origins of the word Dharma==
In the [[Rigveda]], the word appears as an ''n''-stem, ''{{IAST|dhárman-}}'', with a range of meanings encompassing "something established or firm" (in the literal sense of prods or poles), figuratively "sustainer, supporter" (of deities), and in the abstract, similar to the semantics of Greek [[ethos]], "fixed decree, statute, law",

The word is from a root common [[Indo-Iranian]] root ''dhar'' "to fasten, to support, to hold", continuing [[PIE]] ''*dher'', in the [[IEW]] connected with Latin ''frēnum'' "rein, horse tack", Germanic words for "hidden, held back" ([[Old High German|OHG]] ''tarni'' "''latens''"), and extended to ''dher-gh'', with [[Old Church Slavonic|OCS]] ''drъžǫ, drъžati'' "to hold, possess". Etymological identity of ''dharma'' with Latin ''firmus'' (whence English ''firm'') has been suggested, but remains uncertain.

From the [[Atharvaveda]] and in [[Classical Sanskrit]], the stem is thematic, ''{{IAST|dhárma-}}'' (&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350; in the [[Devanagari]] script), and in [[Pāli]], it takes the form ''dhamma''. [[Monier-Williams]] attempts to gesture at the [[semantic field]] of the spiritual and religious meanings of the term with "virtue, morality, religion, religious merit". It being used in most or all philosophies and religions of [[India]]n origin, the "[[dharmic faiths]]" including [[Hinduism]] (Sanatana Dharma), [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], it is difficult to provide a single concise definition for Dharma. The word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations. Dharma also is practiced in the [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] traditions. 


[[Rene Guenon]], father of the 20th century school of [[perennial philosophy]], said: 

<blockquote>
It [dharma] is, so to speak, the essential nature of a being, comprising the sum of its particular qualities or characteristics, and determining, by virtue of the tendencies or dispositions it implies, the manner in which this being will conduct itself, either in a general way or in relation to each particular circumstance.  The same idea may be applied, not only to a single being, but also to an organized collectivity, to a species, to all the beings included in a cosmic cycle or state of existence, or even to the whole order of the Universe; it then, at one level or another, signifies conformity with the essential nature of beings&hellip; (from Guenon's "Introduction to the Study of Hindu Doctrines")
</blockquote>

[[David Frawley]], an expert on Hindu philosophy and religion, comments on Dharma as follows:

<blockquote>
A universal tradition has room for all faiths and all religious and spiritual practices regardless of the time or country of their origin.  Yet it places religious and spiritual teachings in their appropriate place relative to the ultimate goal of Self-realization, to which secondary practices are subordinated.  Sanatan Dharma also recognizes that the greater portion of human religious aspirations has always been unknown, undefined and outside of any institutionalized belief.  Sanatan Dharma thereby gives reverence to individual spiritual experience over any formal religious doctrine. Wherever the Universal Truth is manifest; there is Sanatan Dharma—whether it is in a field of religion, art or science, or in the life of a person or community.  Wherever the Universal Truth is not recognized, or is scaled down or limited to a particular group, book or person, even if done so in the name of God, there Sanatan Dharma ceases to function, whatever the activity is called.
</blockquote>

According to the [[Natchintanai Scripture]]:

<blockquote>
By the laws of Dharma that govern body and mind, you must fear sin and act righteously.  Wise men by thinking and behaving in this way become worthy to gain bliss both here and hereafter.
</blockquote>

[[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the lord of death, is also known as ''Dharma'', since he works within the laws of karma and morality, regulated by divine principles. More familiar is the embodiment of Dharma in Lord [[Rama]], an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]. The eldest [[Pandava]], [[Yudhishthira]] was referred to as ''DharmaRaj'' (Most pious One) owing to his steadfastness to Truth & Dharma. 

The teachings, doctrines, philosophies and practices associated with furthering ''Dharma'' are also referred to as such. Sometimes, specific qualifiers are used - viz. ''Buddha-Dharma'' and ''Jain-Dharma'' to distinguish them from [[Sanatana_Dharma]]. 

For many Buddhists, the '''Dharma''' most often means the body of teachings expounded by the [[Buddha]]. The word is also used in Buddhist [[phenomenology]] as a term roughly equivalent to [[phenomenon]], a basic unit of existence and/or experience.

In scripture translations ''dharma'' is often best left untranslated, as it has acquired a lively life of its own in English that is more expressive than any simplistic translation. Common translations and glosses include "right way of living," Divine Law, Path of Righteousness, order, faith, "natural harmony," rule, fundamental teachings, and duty. ''Dharma'' may be used to refer to rules of the operation of the mind or universe in a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] system, or to rules of comportment in an ethical system.

==Dharma in Hinduism==
{{Hinduism small}}

Within [[Indian philosophy]] "dharma" also means "property" and "dharmin" means "property-bearer". In a Sanskrit sentence like "shabdo 'nityaH" ([[Sanskrit]] transliterated according to the [[Kyoto-Harvard convention]]), "sound is impermanent", "sound" is the bearer of the property "impermanence". Likewise, in the sentence "iha ghataH", "here, there is a pot", "here" is the bearer of the property "pot-existence" - this just goes to show that the categories property and property-bearer are closer to those of a logical predicate and its subject-term, and not to a grammatical predicate and subject.

===Origin and development in Hinduism===
A common manner of describing Hinduism among its adherents is as a ''way of life'', as "Dharma." It defies dogma and thus seeks to instead align the human body, mind, and soul in harmony with nature. 

Our very limitation is guided under and over a universal understanding, that of Dharma. The Atharva Veda, the last of the four books of the [[Vedas]], utilizes symbolism to describe ''dharma's'' role. Thus we are bound by the laws of time, space and causation according to finite reality, which itself is a limitation imposed by the self-projection of the infinite [[Brahman]] as the cosmos. Dharma is the foundation of this causal existence, the one step below the infinite. Indeed, dharma is the projection of divine order from Brahman, and as such:

::::: "''Prithivim Dharmana Dhritam''"

::::: "''This world is upheld by Dharma''"

:::::-- ('''Atharva Veda''')

===Proto-dharma: rta in the Vedas===
To assess a concept whose explication is bewildering in range, it is useful to trace its nascence and subsequent development in [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] culture. In the [[Vedas]], which span back to [[20th century BCE|2000 BCE]] (and much further in oral tradition), the first concept that is strikingly ''dharmic'' is that of [[rta]]. 

Rta literally means the "course of things." At first, the early [[Hindus]] (or followers of the "Sanatan Dharma") were notably inquisitive as to the inscrutable order of nature, how the heavenly bodies, the rushing winds and flowing waters, the consistent cycling of the seasons, were regulated. Thenceforth sprang rta, whose all-purpose role it was to signify this order, the path that was always followed. Through all the metamorphoses and permutations of nature, of life in general, there was one unchangeable fact: rta.

Soon it transcended its passive role as a mere signifier and took on a greater one, that of an active imposition of order. Not only the natural principles, but the gods and goddesses themselves, were obliged to abide by rta. Rta became the father, the law of justice and righteousness, unyielding but eminently fair. It grew, as Radhakrishnan states, from "physical" to "divine" in its purvey. 

The world's seeming mess of altercating fortune, the caprice of the divinities, was now intelligible. Indeed, there was a single, unchanging harmony working 'behind the scenes.' A right path existed, ready to be taken by the righteous ones. Rta signifies the way life ought to be, shifting from physical to divine, from [[natural]] to [[moral]] order. Rta was morality, the equitable law of the universe. The conception of this all-transcending, supramental force that is, practically, the same concept as later understandings of dharma, is captured in this early [[Vedic religion|Vedic]] prayer, preempting the liturgical strains of classical [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[mantra]]s involving ''dharma'':

:::::"''O Indra, lead us on the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils''."

:::::--('''Rig Veda Book X, Chapter CXXXIII, Verse 6''')

Thus we see the logical progression of an early 'course of things' into an all-encompassing moral order, a path and way of righteousness, an all-encompassing harmony of the universe, in the Vedic idea of Rta. ([[#References|1]])

===Developing conceptions===
An earlier and insightful demonstration of the continuity of thought from rta to dharma is a brief but "pregnant definition" (([[#References|3]]) of dharma given in the Brihadaranyaka [[Upanishad]], a part of the [[Veda]]. Founded upon the Hindu ideas of, as R. H. Hume's "intelligent [[monism]]," with [[Brahman]] the [[monad]], the Upanishads saw dharma as the universal principle of law, order, harmony, all in all truth, that sprang first from Brahman. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the universe. It is ''sat'', truth, a major tenet of Hinduism. This hearkens back to the conception of the Rig Veda that "Ekam Sat," (Truth Is One), of the idea that Brahman is "''Sacchidananda''" (Truth-Consciousness-Bliss). Dharma has imbibed the highest principles of Truth, and as such is <u>the</u> central guiding principle in the Hindu conception of existence. Dharma is not just law, or harmony, it is pure Reality. In the Brihadaranyaka's own words: 

:::::" ''Verily, that which is Dharma is truth''. 
:::::''Therefore they say of a man who speaks truth, 'He speaks the Dharma,' '' 

:::::''or of a man who speaks the Dharma, 'He speaks the Truth.' ''
:::::''Verily, both these things are the same''." 
:::::('''Brh. Upanishad, 1.4.14''') ([[#References|2]])

===Dharma as a Purushartha===
In moving through the four stages of life, viz. [[Brahmacharya]], [[Grihastha]], [[Vaanprastha]] , [[Sanyaasa]], a person also seeks to fulfill the four essentials ('''purushaartha''') of Dharma, [[Artha]] (worldly gain}, [[Kama]] (sensual pleasures), and [[Moksha]] (liberation from [[reincarnation]] or rebirth). Moksha, although the ultimate goal, is emphasized more in the last two stages of life, while Artha and Kama are primary only during Grihasthaashram. Dharma, however is essential in all four stages.

===Kane's view===
According to [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|Dr.Pandurang Vaman Kane]], the word "Dharma" acquired a sense of "the privileges, duties and obligations of a man, his standard of conduct as a member of the Aryan community, as a member of the caste and as a person in a particular state of life."

==In Buddhism ==
{{main|Dharma (Buddhism)}}
{{buddhism}}
In East Asia, the character for Dharma is [[wiktionary:法|法]], pronounced ''fǎ'' in Mandarin and ''hō'' in Japanese.

===Buddha's teachings===
For practicing Buddhists, references to "dharma" or ''dhamma'' in the singular, particularly as "the" Dharma, is used to mean the teachings of the Buddha, and is sometimes referred to as the Buddha-Dharma. This latter signification has nothing to do with the personality of the spiritual teacher Siddhartha Gautama but rather signifies the importance of the attitude of mind that enables an adept or practitioner to re-harmonise his personal nature with the underlying principle (Dharma) behind natural phenomena (an attitude known in [[theism|theistic]] religion as 'surrendering to the Will of the Lord') leading towards the undoing of all egoistic falsehood and ultimately release in [[nirvana]] - the peace of liberation ([[moksha]])

The status of the Dharma is regarded variably by different traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate and transcendent truth which is utterly beyond worldly things, somewhat like the Christian [[logos]]. Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the 84,000 different teachings (the Kanjur) that the Buddha gave to various types of people based on their needs.

"Dharma" usually refers inclusively not just to the sayings of the Buddha but to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[Schools of Buddhism|schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and expand upon the Buddha's teachings.  For others still, they see the dharma as referring to the "truth" or ultimate reality or "the way things are" (Tib. Cho).

The Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of buddhism of which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge in (what one relies on for his/her lasting happiness).  The three jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddha]] (mind's perfection of enlightenment), the Dharma (teachings and methods), and the [[Sangha]] (awakened beings who provide guidance and support).

===Qualities of Buddha Dharma===
The Teaching of the Buddha also has six supreme qualities:

:# (Svakkhato) The Dhamma is not a speculative philosophy, but is the Universal Law found through enlightenment and is preached precisely. Therefore it is Excellent in the beginning (Sīla ... Moral principles), Excellent in the middle (Samadhi. . . Concentration) and Excellent in the end (Pań ña . . . Wisdom),
:# (Samditthiko) The Dhamma can be tested by practice and therefore he who follows it will see the result by himself through his own experience.
:# (Akāliko) The Dhamma is able to bestow timeless and immediate results here and now, for which there is no need to wait until the future or next existence.
:# (Ehipassiko) The Dhamma welcomes all beings to put it to the test and come see for themselves.
:# (Opāneyiko) The Dhamma is capable of being entered upon and therefore it is worthy to be followed as a part of one's life.
:# (Paccattam veditabbo viññūnhi) The Dhamma can be perfectly realized only by the noble disciples (Ariyas) who have matured and enlightened enough in supreme wisdom. 

Knowing these attributes, Buddhists believe that they will attain the greatest peace and happiness through the practice of the Dhamma. Each person is therefore fully responsible for himself to put it in the real practice.

Here the Buddha is compared to an experienced and skilful doctor, and the Dhamma to proper medicine. However efficient the doctor or wonderful the medicine may be, the patients cannot be cured unless they take the medicine properly. So the practice of the Dhamma is the only way to attain the final deliverance of Nibbāna.

These teachings ranged from understanding [[karma]] (cause and effect) and developing good impressions in one's mind, to how to reach full enlightenment by recognizing the nature of mind.

===Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology===
Other uses include '''dharma''', normally spelled with a small "d" (to differentiate), which refers to a ''phenomenon'' or ''constituent factor'' of human experience. This was gradually expanded into a classification of constituents of the entire material and mental world. Rejecting the substantial existence of permanent entities which are qualified by possibly changing qualities, Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] philosophy, which enumerated [[seventy-five dharmas]], came to propound that these "constituent factors" are the only type of entity that truly exists. This notion is of particular importance for the analysis of human experience: Rather than assuming that mental states inhere in a cognizing subject, or a soul-substance, Buddhist philosophers largely propose that mental states alone exist as "momentary elements of consciousness", and that a subjective perceiver is assumed.

One of the central tenets of Buddhism, is the denial of a separate permanent "I", and is outlined in the [[three marks of existence]]. The three signs: 1. [[Dukkha]] - Suffering  (Pali: Dukkha), 2. [[Anitya]] - Change/Impermanence (Pali: Anicca), 3. [[Anatman]] - No-I (Pali: Annatta). At the heart of Buddhism, is the denial of an "I" (and hence the delusion) as a separate self-existing entity. 

Later, Buddhist philosophers like [[Nagarjuna|N&#257;g&#257;rjuna]] would question whether the dharmas (momentary elements of consciousness) truly have a separate existence of their own. (ie Do they exist apart from anything else?) Rejecting any inherent reality to the dharmas, he asked (rhetorically):
<blockquote>
&#347;&#363;nye&#7779;u sarvadharme&#7779;u kim ananta&#7745; kimantavat
<br />kim anantam antavac ca n&#257;nanta&#7745; n&#257;ntavacca ki&#7745;
<br />ki&#7745; tad eva kim anyat ki&#7745; &#347;&#257;&#347;vata&#7745; kim a&#347;&#257;&#347;vata&#7745;
<br />a&#347;&#257;&#347;vata&#7745; &#347;&#257;&#347;vata&#7745; ca ki&#7745; v&#257; nobhayam apyata&#7717; 'tha
<br />sarvopalambhpa&#347;ama&#7717; prapañcopa&#347;ama&#7717; &#347;iva&#7717;
<br />na kva cit kasyacit ka&#347;cid dharmo buddhena de&#347;ita&#7717;| 
<br />
<br />When all dharmas are empty, what is endless? What has an end?
<br />What is endless and with an end? What is not endless and not with an end?
<br />What is ''it''? What is ''other''? What is permanent? What is impermanent?
<br />What is impermanent and permanent? What is neither? 
<br />
<br />Auspicious is the pacification of phenomenal metastasis, the pacification of all apprehending;
<br />There is no dharma whatsoever taught by the Buddha to whomever, whenever, wherever.
--M&#363;lamadhyamakak&#257;rik&#257;, nirv&#7751;&#257;napar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;, 25:22-24
</blockquote>

===Dharma as righteousness===
According to S. N. Goenka, teacher of Vipassana Meditation, the original meaning of dhamma is “dhareti ti dhamma’, or “that which is contained”.  Dharma in the Buddhist scriptures has a variety of meanings, including “phenomenon”, and "nature" or "characteristic". Dharma also means ‘mental contents’, and is paired with citta, which means heart/mind.  The pairing is paralleled with the pairing of kaya (body) and vedana (feelings or sensations, that which arise within the body but experienced through the mind), in major sutras such as the Mahasatipatthana sutra.  Dharma is also used to refer to the teachings of the Buddha, not in the context of the words of one man, even an enlightened man, but as a reflection of natural law which was re-discovered by this man and shared with the world.  A person who lives their life with an understanding of this natural law, is a “dhammic” person, which is often translated as “righteous”.

==In Jainism==
Dharma is natural. [[Jain]] [[Acharya]] [[Samantabhadra]] writes: "Vatthu sahavo dhammo"  the dharma is the nature of an object. It is the nature of the soul to be free, thus for the soul, the dharma ia paralaukika, beyond worldly. However the nature of the body is to seek self-preservation and be engaged in pleasures. 

Thus there are two dharmas.

===The two Dharmas===
Acharya [[Haribhadra]] (approx. 6-7th cent.) discusses  dharma in Dharma-Bindu. 
he writes (Translation by Y. Malaiya):

soayam-anushhThaatRi-bhedat dvi-vidho <br>
gRihastha-dharmo yati-dharmash-cha |

Because of the difference in practice, Dharma is of two kinds,
for the householders and for the monks.

tatra gRihastha-dharmoapi dvi-vidhaH<br>
saamanyato visheshhatash-cha |

Of the householder's dharma, there are two kinds,"ordinary" and "special"

tatra saamnayato gRihastha-dharmaH kula-krama-agatam-anindyaM<br>
vibhavady-apekshayaa nyaato.anushhThaanaM |

The ordinary gRihastha-dharma should be carried out according to tradition, such that it is not objectionable, according to ones abilities such as wealth, in accordance with nyaya (everyone treated fairly and according to laws).

[[Somadeva]] suri (10th c.) termss the "ordinary" and "special"
dharmas laukika and the paralukika dharmas respectively:

dvau hi dharamau gRiahasthANam, laukikaH, paarlaukikaH |<br>
lokaashrayo bhavedaadyah, parah syaad-aagama-AshrayaH ||

A householder follows both laukika and the paralukika dharmas at the
same time.

==References in pop culture==
Dharma is a frequent allusion on [[American_Broadcasting_Company|ABC]]'s hit show [[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]. The [[DHARMA Initiative]] is the name of the corporation that controls apparently much of what happens on the island. It is responsible for the food and medicine supplies and the bunkers where some of the survivors have taken shelter (also known as hatches). It allegedly conducted (or is conducting) experiments in many fields. Any clear relation to Dharma and its philosophies are yet to be elucidated. As well, the show's producers have confirmed that DHARMA, in Lost, is an acronym, but will not yet reveal its meaning.

In the [[Lost Experience]], DHARMA stands for '''''D'''epartment of '''H'''euristics '''A'''nd '''R'''esearch on '''M'''aterial '''A'''pplications''.

In the [[Dragon Quest]] [[video game series]], ''Dharma Shrine'' serves as a place for players to change their job classes.

In the 1968 [[Jethro Tull]] album, [[This Was]], there is a great song called "Dharma for One", which Tull also played two years later at the 1970 [[Isle of Wight Festival]]
