'''آرګېنين''' (په لنډه توګه '''Arg''' يا '''R''')<ref>{{cite web | author=IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | title=Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | work=Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols & Terminology etc | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/ | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> is an α-[[amino acid]]. The [[Optical isomerism|<small>L</small>-form]] is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids. Its [[codons]] are CGU, CGC, CGA and CGG. In mammals, arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual.  Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants.  Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the [[urea cycle]].

Arginine was first isolated from a [[lupin]] seedling extract in 1886 by the Swiss chemist Ernst Schulze. 

==Structure==
Arginine consists of a 4-carbon [[aliphatic]] straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a complex [[guanidine|guanidinium]] group. With a p''K''<sub>a</sub> of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic and even most basic environments, and thus imparts [[Basic (chemistry)|basic]] chemical properties to arginine. Because of the [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is de-localized, enabling the formation of multiple [[Hydrogen bond|H-bonds]].

==Sources==
===Dietary Sources===
Arginine is a [[essential amino acid|nonessential amino acid]], meaning it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained directly through the diet. Arginine is found in a wide variety of foods, including<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keysupplements.com/articles/L-Arginine-Supplements-Nitric-Oxide-Scientific-Studies.htm |title=L-Arginine Supplements Nitric Oxide Scientific Studies Food Sources |accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>: 
* '''Animal sources''': dairy products (e.g. [[cottage cheese]], [[ricotta]], nonfat [[dry milk]], skim yogurt), [[beef]], [[pork]] (e.g. bacon, ham), [[poultry]] (e.g. chicken and turkey light meat), [[wild game]] (e.g. pheasant, quail), [[seafood]] (e.g. halibut, lobster, salmon, shrimp, snails, tuna in water), [[chocolate]]
* '''Vegetarian sources''': [[wheat germ]] and flour, buckwheat, [[granola]], [[oatmeal]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] (coconut, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, hazel nuts, peanuts), [[seeds]] (pumpkin, sesame, sunflower), chick [[peas]], cooked [[soybeans]]
* '''Other''': some [[energy drinks]]

===Bioynthesis===
Arginine is synthesized from [[citrulline]] by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes [[argininosuccinate synthetase]] (ASS) and [[argininosuccinate lyase]] (ASL). This is energetically costly, as the synthesis of each molecule of argininosuccinate requires hydrolysis of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP); i.e., two ATP equivalents. 

Citrulline can be derived from multiple sources: 
* from arginine via [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS);
* from [[ornithine]] via catabolism of [[proline]] or [[glutamine]]/[[glutamate]];
* from [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]] (ADMA) via DDAH. 

The pathways linking arginine, [[glutamine]], and [[proline]] are bidirectional. Thus, the net utilization or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage. 

On a whole-body basis, synthesis of arginine occurs principally via the [[intestinal–renal axis]], wherein [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[small intestine]], which produce [[citrulline]] primarily from [[glutamine]] and [[glutamate]], collaborate with the [[proximal tubule cell]]s of the [[kidney]], which extract citrulline from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the circulation. Consequently, impairment of small bowel or renal function can reduce endogenous arginine synthesis, thereby increasing the dietary requirement. 

Synthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that also induce [[Nitric oxide synthase|iNOS]]. Thus, citrulline, a coproduct of the NOS-catalyzed reaction, can be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the '''citrulline-NO''' or '''arginine-citrulline pathway'''. This is demonstrated by the fact that in many cell types, citrulline can substitute for arginine to some degree in supporting NO synthesis. However, recycling is not quantitative because citrulline accumulates along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO, in NO-producing cells.<ref>[[Image:Free review.png]] Enzymes of arginine metabolism ''J Nutr. 2004 Oct; 134(10 Suppl): 2743S-2747S; PMID 15465778'' [http://www.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/10/2743S Free text]</ref>

==Function==
Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. Arginine, taken in combination with [[proanthocyanidin]]s<ref>Stanislavov, R. and Nikolova. 2003. Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction with Pycnogenol and L-arginine. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 29(3): 207 – 213.</ref> or [[yohimbine]]<ref>Lebret, T., Hervéa, J. M., Gornyb, P., Worcelc, M. and Botto, H. 2002. Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Combination of L-Arginine Glutamate and Yohimbine Hydrochloride: A New Oral Therapy for Erectile Dysfunction. European Urology 41(6): 608-613.</ref>, has also been used as a treatment for [[erectile dysfunction]].

===In proteins===
The geometry, charge distribution and ability to form multiple H-bonds make arginine ideal for binding negatively charged groups. For this reason arginine prefers to be on the outside of the proteins where it can interact with the polar environment. 
Incorporated in proteins, arginine can also be converted to citrulline by PAD enzymes. In addition, arginine can be [[Methylation|methylated]] by protein methyltransferases.

===As a precursor===
Arginine is the immediate precursor of [[Nitric oxide|NO]], urea, ornithine and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of [[creatine]]; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine), citrulline, and glutamate.  For being a precursor of NO, (relaxes blood vessels), arginine is used in many conditions where [[vasodilation]] is required.  The presence of [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]] (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for [[vascular disease]], just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy [[endothelium]].

===Implication in herpes simplex viral replication===

Tissues culture studies have shown the suppression of viral replication when the [[lysine]] to arginine ratio ''in vitro'' favors lysine. The therapeutic consequence of this finding is unclear, but dietary arginine may affect the effectiveness of lysine supplementation.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Griffith RS, Norins AL, Kagan C. | title=A multicentered study of lysine therapy in Herpes simplex infection | journal=Dermatologica. | year=1978 | pages=257-267 | volume=156 | issue=5 | id={{PMID|640102}} }}</ref>

===Implication in contributing to risk of death from heart disease===

A recent Johns Hopkins study testing the addition of L-arginine to standard postinfarction treatment has implicated L-arginine supplementation with an increased risk of death in patients recovering from heart attack.<ref>Arginine Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction ''JAMA. 2006 Jan; Vol.295 #1: 58-64; PMID 16391217'' [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/295/1/58 Abstract]</ref>  This study has been discussed in some detail in : "Reverse Heart Disease Now" by Stephen T Sinatra MD and James C Roberts MD, publ. Wiley 2006 ISBN 0-471-74704-1 at pp 111 -113.

===Growth hormone===
Arginine increases the production of [[growth hormone]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alba-Roth J, Müller O, Schopohl J, von Werder K |title=Arginine stimulates growth hormone secretion by suppressing endogenous somatostatin secretion |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1186-9 |year=1988 |pmid=2903866}}</ref>
Reports of its effects on male muscular development are not clearly proven.

===Prolactin===
Although there haven't been thorough studies, some sources claim that arginine helps release [[prolactin]], an estrogenic compound which is associated with lactation, and like all estrogenic compounds may curb the secretion of testosterone{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. Thus some bodybuilders stay away from pure arginine, intaking only amounts naturally found in protein.
