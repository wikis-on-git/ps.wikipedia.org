'''Nicaragua''' ({{lang-es|República de Nicaragua}}, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[re'puβlika ðe nika'raɰwa]}}) is a republic in [[Central America]]. Although it is the largest nation in the region, it is also the least densely populated. The country is bordered on the north by [[هندوراس]] and on south by [[کوسټاريکا]]. Its western [[coastal|coastline]] is on the [[Pacific Ocean]], while the east side of the country is on the [[Caribbean Sea]].

The country's name is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Nicarao]], the name of the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]-speaking tribe which inhabited the shores of [[Lago de Nicaragua]] before the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas]], and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word {{lang|es|''Agua''}}, meaning [[water]], due to the presence of the large lakes [[Lago de Nicaragua]] and [[Lago de Managua]] in the region.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, Nicaragua was the name given to the narrow strip of land between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean.  Chief Nicarao ruled over that land when the first conquerors arrived.  The term was eventually applied, by extension, to the group that inhabited that region: the Nicaraos or Niquiranos. 

The pre-columbian Nicarao came to the area from northern regions after the fall of [[Teotihuacán]], on the advice of their priests or religious leaders.  According to tradition, they were to travel south until they encountered a lake with two volcanoes rising out of the waters, and stopped when they reached [[Ometepe]], the largest fresh-water volcanic island in the world.


== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Nicaragua}}
Politics of Nicaragua takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Nicaragua]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Nicaragua|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Nicaragua's current president is [[Enrique Bolaños Geyer]].

== Administrative Divisions ==
{{main|Departments of Nicaragua}}

[[Nicaragua]] is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[republic]]. For administrative purposes it is divided into 15 [[Department (subnational entity)|departments]] (''departamentos'') and two self-governing regions (autonomous communities) based on the Spanish model. The two autonomous regions are [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte]] and [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur]], often referred to as ''RAAN'' and ''RAAS'', respectively.  Until they were granted autonomy in 1985 they formed the single department of [[Zelaya (Nicaragua)|Zelaya]].

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Nicaragua}}

At approximately 129,500 square kilometers (50,000&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]])—roughly the size of the state of New York, Nicaragua contains 7% of the world's [[biodiversity]] and the second largest [[rainforest]] in the Americas. Close to 20% of the country's territory is protected as national parks or biological reserves. The country is bordered by Costa Rica on the south and Honduras on the north, with the Caribbean Sea to the east.

Nicaragua has three distinct geographical regions: the [[Pacific]] Lowlands, the North-Central Mountains and the [[Mosquito Coast|Atlantic Lowlands]]. Nicaragua is administratively divided into 15 [[Department entity|departments]] and two [[Autonomous entity|autonomous regions]]. The departments are subdivided into municipalities (''municipios'').

=== The Pacific Lowlands ===
Located in the west of the country, these lowlands consist of a broad, hot, fertile plain. Punctuating this plain are several large volcanoes of the [[Maribios]] mountain range, including [[Mombacho]] just outside Granada, and [[Momotombo]] near to León.  The lowland area runs from the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] to Nicaragua's Pacific border with Costa Rica south of [[Lake Nicaragua]].  This region is the most populous. About 27% of the nation's population lives in and around [[Managua]], the capital city, on the southern shores of Lake Managua. 

In addition to its beach and resort communities, the Pacific Lowlands is also the repository for much of Nicaragua's Spanish colonial heritage. Cities such as [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]] and [[León, Nicaragua|León]] abound in colonial architecture and artifacts.

=== The Central Region ===
[[دوتنه:Guardabarranco.JPG|left|thumb|''Guardabarranco'' ([[Turquoise-browed Motmot]]): the national bird]]
This is an upland region away from the Pacific coast, with a cooler climate than the Pacific Lowlands. About a quarter of the country's agriculture takes place in this region, with [[coffee]] grown on the higher slopes. [[Oak]]s, [[pine]]s, [[moss]], [[fern]]s and [[orchid]]s are abundant in the [[cloud forest]]s of the region.

Bird life in the forests of the central region includes the [[Resplendent Quetzal]], [[goldfinch]]es, [[hummingbird]]s, [[jay]]s and [[Emerald Toucanet|toucanets]].

=== The Atlantic Lowlands ===
This large [[rainforest]] region, with several large rivers running through it, is very sparsely populated and is the second-largest rainforest in the Americas after the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] in Brazil. The [[Río Coco (Honduras/Nicaragua)|Río Coco]] forms the border with Honduras. The Caribbean coastline is much more sinuous than its generally straight Pacific counterpart.  Lagoons and deltas make it very irregular.

Nicaragua's [[tropical]] east coast is very different from the rest of the country. The climate is predominantly tropical, with high temperature and high humidity. Around the area's principal city of [[Bluefields]], English is widely spoken along with the official Spanish and the population more closely resembles that found in many typical Caribbean ports than the rest of Nicaragua. 

A great variety of birds can be observed including [[eagle]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]], [[toucan]]s, [[parakeet]]s and [[macaw]]s. Animal life in the area includes several different species of [[monkey]]s, [[ant-eater]]s, white-tailed [[deer]] and [[tapir]]s.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Nicaragua}}

[[دوتنه:ometepe_nic.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Ometepe Island|Maderas and Concepcion Volcanoes]], popular tourist destination in Nicaragua]]
Nicaragua's economy has historically been based on the export of [[cash crop]]s such as [[banana]]s, [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]]. Nicaragua's [[rum]] is renowned as among the best in Latin America, and its [[tobacco]] and [[beef]] are also well regarded. During the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contra War]] in the early 1980's, much of the country's infrastructure was damaged or destroyed, and inflation ran for a time at several thousand per cent.  Since the end of the war almost two decades ago, many state-owned industries have been [[privatization|privatized]].  Inflation has been brought to manageable levels, and the economy has grown quite rapidly in recent years.

As in many other developing countries, a large segment of the economically poor in Nicaragua are women. In addition, a relatively high percentage of Nicaragua's average homes have a woman as head of household: 39% of urban homes and 28% of the rural ones.

The country is still a recovering economy and it continues to implement further reforms, on which aid from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] is conditional.  In 2005, finance ministers of the leading eight industrialized nations ([[G-8]]) agreed to forgive Nicaragua's foreign debt, as part of the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries|HIPC]] program.

The Nicaraguan unit of currency is the [[Córdoba (currency)|Córdoba]] (NIO) and was named after [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] its national founder.

=== Tourism ===

In the last 15 years of so, the [[Tourism]] sector has seen an economic boom, positively affecting the Nicaraguan life and economy. Since 2001, $600 million dollars have been invested in tourism, most of the coming from [[Nicaraguan]] and [[United States|American]] investors. The country is mostly famous for its landscapes, flora and fauna, culture, beaches and of course, its lakes and volcanos.[[دوتنه:PLAYA_MARSELLA_NICARAGUA.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pacific Beaches in Nicaragua]]


According to the Ministry of Tourism of Nicaragua, the colonial city of [[Granada, Nicaragua]] is the preferred spot for tourists. Also, the cities of [[Leon]], [[Masaya]], [[Rivas]] and the likes of [[San Juan del Sur]], [[Ometepe]], [[Mombacho Volcano]], [[Corn Island]],and others are main tourist attractions. In addition, Eco-tourism and Surfing also attract many tourists to Nicaragua.

The economic benefits which can be derived from tourism cannot be disputed; today, tourism constitutes around 10% of the [[Nicaraguan]] income. More investment and support from the government is expected after the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement was signed.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Nicaragua}}
According to the 2005 census, Nicaragua has a population of 5,483,400, an increase of 20% on the 1995 census figure of 4,357,099.

[[دوتنه:NICARAGUAN FARMING BOY.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Nicaraguan child farmer]]

Nicaraguans of European or mixed European and indigenous stock ([[mestizos]]) make up a combined 86% of the population, with about 69% being mestizos and 17% being of [[European]] descent (mostly Spanish, German, Italian and French).

In the nineteenth century, there had been a substantial indigenous minority, but this group was also largely assimilated culturally into the Hispanic mainstream. Primarily in the 19th century, Nicaragua saw several waves of immigration from other European nations. In particular the northern cities of Esteli and Matagalpa have significant 4th generation German communities. Most of the Mestizo and European descent population live in the western regions of the country as in the cities of Managua, Granada and Leon.

About 9% of Nicaragua's population is black, or afronicaragüense, and mainly resides in the country's sparsely populated eastern or Atlantic coast. The black population is mostly of West Indian (Antillean) origin, the descendants of indentured labourers brought mostly from Jamaica and Haiti when the region was a British protectorate. Nicaragua has the second largest black population in Central America after Panama. There is also a smaller number of [[Garifuna]], a people of mixed Carib, Angolan, Congolese and Arawak descent.

The remaining 5% is comprised of the unmixed descendants of the country's indigenous inhabitants.  Nicaragua's [[pre-Colombian]] population consisted of the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking Nicarao people of the west after whom the country is named, and six other ethnic groups including the [[Miskito]]s, Ramas and [[Sumo (people)|Sumos]] along the Caribbean coast.  While very few pure-blooded Nicarao people still exist, the Caribbean peoples have remained distinct. In the mid-1980s, the government divided the department of [[Zelaya]] - consisting of the eastern half of the country - into two autonomous regions and granted the African and indigenous people of this region limited self-rule within the Republic. 

There is also a small [[Middle East]]ern-Nicaraguan community of [[Syrian]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Palestinian]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] people in Nicaragua with a total population of about 30,000, and an [[East Asia]]n community of [[Japan]]ese, [[Taiwan]]ese and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] people of almost 8,000. These minorities speak Spanish while maintaining their ancestral languages as well.

[[دوتنه:palo_de_mayo.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Caribbean people dancing Palo de Mayo]]
Spanish is spoken by about 90% of the country's population; Nicaraguans speak standard Iberoamerican Spanish with some similarities to [[Galician]] Spanish—structurally similar to [[Rioplatense Spanish|Argentinian Spanish]] which uses "vos" instead of "tu" along with the "[[Voseo|vos]]" conjugation, but with a different intonation.  The black population of the east coast region has [[English language|English]] as its first language.  Several indigenous peoples of the east still use their original languages, the main ones being the Miskito, Sumo, and Rama indigenous groups.  

See:
* [[Central American Spanish]]

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the major religion, but [[evangelism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] groups have grown recently, and there are strong [[Anglican]] and [[Moravian (religion)|Moravian]] communities on the Caribbean coast.

90% of Nicaraguans live in the Pacific lowlands and the adjacent interior highlands. The population is 54% urban. An estimated 2 million Nicaraguans live outside of Nicaragua.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Nicaragua}}

The population of Nicaragua is very young with approx. 40% under 18 years of age.  The country has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, largely founded on [[Iberian Peninsula|European (Iberian Peninsula)]] culture but enriched with Amerindian sounds and flavours.  Nicaragua has historically been an important source of [[poetry]] in the Hispanic world, with internationally renowned contributors such as [[Rubén Darío]].[[دوتنه:Nicaboy.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A Nicaraguan Child in Granada, Nicaragua]]


Education is free for all Nicaraguans. Elementary education is free and compulsory, and communities located on the Atlantic Coast have access to education in their native language. Higher education has financial, organic and administrative autonomy, according to the law. Also, freedom of subjects is recognized.

Nicaraguan culture can further be defined in several distinct strands.  The west of the country was colonized by [[Spain]] and its people are mostly [[Mestizo]]s and [[European]] in composition; Spanish is invariably their first language.

[[دوتنه:gueguense1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Macho Raton]]


The eastern half of the country, on the other hand, was once a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protectorate]].  [[English language|English]] is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  Both languages are taught in schools.  Its culture is similar to that of [[Caribbean]] nations that were or are British possessions, such as [[Jamaica]], [[Belize]], The [[Cayman Islands]], etc.  Although recent immigration by [[mestizo]]s has largely influenced younger generations and an increasing number of people are either bilingual at home or speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] only.  There is a relatively large population of people of mixed [[Africa]]n descent, as well as a smaller [[Garifuna]] population. Due to the African influence, in the East Coast, there is a different kind of music.  It is the popular [[dance music]] called 'Palo de Mayo', or Maypole, which is celebrated during the Maypole Festival, during the month of May. The music is sensual with intense rhythms. The celebration is derived from the British [[Maypole]] for [[May Day]] celebration, as adapted and transformed by the Afro-nicaraguans on the Caribbean or [[Mosquito Coast]].
 


Of the cultures that were present before [[Europe]]an [[colonization]], the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking peoples who populated the west of the country have essentially been assimilated into the latino culture.  In the east, however, several indigenous groups have maintained a distinct identity.  The Miskito, Sumo, and Rama peoples still use their original languages, and also usually speak English and/or Spanish.  The small [[Garifuna]] people speak their own Garifuna language in addition to English and/or Spanish.
