'''''جيارډيا لامبليا''''' (چې پخوا د '''''لامبليا انټېسټېنالېس''''' په نوم سره هم يادېده  يا  '''''جيارډيا ډيوډونالېس''''' او  '''''جيارډيا انټېسټېنالېس''''') يوه [[فلاجلي]] [[پروټوزوني]] [[پرازيت]] دی چې د انسانانو د معدې او کولمې لارې منتن کوي او د [[جيارډياسېز]] ناروغي مېنځ ته راوړي.

==کوربانه==
جيارډيا انسانان په ناروغۍ اخته کوي.  دا يو تر ټولو عام پرازيت دی چې پيشوګانې هم پرې اخته کېږي. د دغه پرازيت په پېورو کوربانو کې غواګانې، سګ لاهوان، هوسۍ، سپي او پسونه هم شامل دي.

==نښې نښانې==
Infection causes [[giardiasis]], a type of [[gastroenteritis]] that manifests itself with severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Other symptoms can include [[bloating]], [[flatulence]], fatigue, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. In some patients, vomiting or nausea is the major symptom. The symptoms usually manifest themselves about seven to ten days after ingestion. Giardia is a major cause of [[intestinal disease]] worldwide and the most frequent non-bacterial cause of [[diarrhea]] in North America. Nonetheless, the basic biology of this parasite is poorly understood.

[[Image:Giardia lamblia life cycle.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Parasite life cycle.]]
''Giardia'' belongs among the [[diplomonad]]s.

Infection from giardia can occur from consuming contaminated food or water; this includes clean-looking mountain streams. It can also be transferred from animal or human [[feces]]. Not every person displays symptoms of infection, but they can still serve as a carrier of the disease. Giardia infection is a concern for people camping in the wilderness or swimming in contaminated streams or [[lake]]s, especially the artificial lakes formed by [[beaver]] [[dam]]s (hence the popular name for giardiasis, "Beaver Fever").

Giardia may be ingested at camping areas, day care centers, waterborne outbreaks, and is also highly infectious to other family members once one individual is infected.  Other causes can be uncooked food, contaminated wells and failed municipal water systems.

The life cycle begins with a noninfected cyst being excreted out through feces of an infected individual.  Once out in the environment, the cyst becomes infected.  A distinguishing characteristic of the cyst is 4 nuclei and a retracted cytoplasm.  Once ingested by a host, the trophozoite emerges to an active state of feeding and motility.  It feeds on mucous inside the digestive tract and causes the host to have epigastric pain, excessive gas, and diarrhea with fat and mucous but no blood.  This can last from 2 - 4 weeks but for a lactose intolerant individual, it can last up to six months. 

After the feeding stage, the trophozoite undergoes asexual replication through longitudinal binary fission.  The resulting trophoziotes and cysts then pass through the digestive system in the feces.
Distinguishing features of the trophozoites are large karyosomes and lack of peripheral chromatin, giving the two nuclei a halo appearance.  This is a primitive form of protozoa and also lacks mitochondria.

==Manifestation in animals==
Nomenclatures for Giardia species are hard since humans and other animals appear to have morphological identical parasites.   Cats can be cured easily, lambs usually just lose weight, but in calves the parasites can be fatal and often are not responsive to antibiotics or electrolytes.  Carriers among calves can also be asymptomatic.  Dogs have the most problems since usually 30% of the population under one year old is infected in kennels.  It is more a "puppy problem" than an adult one.

Treatment in kennels can be done by identifying the infected dogs and isolating them or just a mass treatment, followed  by cleaning the entire kennel with bleach or other cleaning disinfectants.  The grass area used for exercise should be considered contaminated for at least one month since cysts can survive in the environment for that long.  Prevention can be achieved by quarantine for at least 20 days and managing the water supply to be clear of too many cysts.

==Prophylaxis==
Filter use or boiling is recommended for [[water purification]] of [[drinking water]] in wilderness conditions.

Treatment of drinking water for Giardia typically involves some form of high efficiency filtration and/or chemical disinfection such as [[chlorination]] or [[ozone|ozonation]]. Treatment is necessary throughout North America. Scooping water from the top is not an effective way to avoid Giardia.

Under a normal compound light [[microscope]], ''Giardia'' often looks like a "clown face," with two nuclei outlined by adhesive discs above dark [[median bodies]] that form the "mouth."  Cysts have four nuclei.

==څېړنه==
Giardia alternates between two different forms &mdash; a hardy, dormant [[cyst]] that contaminates water or food and an active, disease-causing form that emerges after the parasite is ingested. [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] grantee Dr. Frances Gillin of the [[University of California, San Diego]] and her colleagues cultivated the entire life cycle of this [[parasite]] in the laboratory, and identified biochemical cues in the host's digestive system which trigger ''Giardia'''s life cycle transformations. They also uncovered several ways in which the parasite  evades the defenses of the infected organism. One of these is by altering the [[protein]]s on its surface, which confounds the ability of the infected animal's [[immune system]] to detect and combat the parasite. Gillin's work reveals why ''Giardia'' infections are extremely persistent and prone to recur. In addition, these insights into ''Giardia''s biology and survival techniques may enable scientists to develop better strategies to understand, prevent, and treat ''giardia'' infections.

==تاريخ==

The [[trophozoite]] form of Giardia was first observed in 1681 by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in his own diarrheal stools. His observations were recreated, using a single lensed microscope of the kind used by Leeuwenhoek, by British microbiologist [[Brian J. Ford]] who showed how clearly one could view [http://www.brianjford.com/Giardia-14-06.pdf Giardia through a primitive microscope].
