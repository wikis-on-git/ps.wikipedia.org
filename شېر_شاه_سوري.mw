These goods had travelled by the route opened in 4th century BCE from China via Schezwan and Yunnan to Burma and eastern India.  From there they had been traded along the India Grand Road (built under the Mauryan Empire) up the Ganges valley to the grand trading city of Taxila and then into central Asia.''" [Page 250]

:"''Humayun escaped and went to Lahore while Sher Khan went back to Gaur to destroy the remnant of the Mughal army and imprison a rebelling governor. Sher Khan became Sher Shah and organized his empire while Humayun, unable to get help from his brothers, fled all the way to the Safavid court in Iran. After subjugating Malwa in 1542, Sher Shah invaded central India.  While capturing a fort in Kalinjar, Sher Shah was killed by a gunpowder explosion in 1545.''"
