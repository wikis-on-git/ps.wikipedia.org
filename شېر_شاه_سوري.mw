'''Sher Shah Suri''' ([[1486]] &ndash; [[1545]]) ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/[[Urdu]]: '''شیر شاہ سوری''') also known as '''Sher Khan''' or '''Lion King''' was the founder of the [[Sur Dynasty]] in the middle of the [[16th century]] in [[South Asia]]. He established his empire after conquering a huge swathe of territory that is now most of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and northern [[India]].  

==مخينه==
Sher Shah Suri was born in [[Sasaram]], [[Bihar]].<ref>[http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P055 Sher Shah Suri<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], known at the time as ethnic ''[[Pashtun people|Afghans]]''. He descended from an [[Afghan]] adventurer recruited by [[Lodhi dynasty|Sultan Bahlol Lodhi]] during his long contest with the [[Sharqi dynasty|Sharqi Sultans]]. The [[Kakar]] tribe at the time inhabited the northeastern plains of [[Balochistan]] and stretched into southern [[Punjab region]], near the city of [[Multan]]. Kakar and Suri affiliated sub-tribes are also found on the outskirts [[Peshewar]], in [[Kandahar]] and as far as [[Sialkot]].

Sher Shah Suri's given title was [[Farid Khan]]. His father was the ''Jagirdar'' (landlord) of an estate located in Sasaram, Bihar which had been conquered by various rulers previously. Ill treated by his stepmother, Sher Shah left home at the age of 15 and went to [[Jaunpur]] to "seek his fortunes", and once there, he committed himself to serious study. He acquired a good command over the Persian language and Arabic language and was known for his ability in effective administration.<ref>[http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P055 Sher Shah Suri<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

Because of his administrative abilities and vision, he was soon appointed by his father to manage the family [[Jagir]]. But again because of his stepmother, he left his father's Jagir and went to [[Bihar]] where he later joined the service of [[Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]].

In 1522, he served [[Bahar Khan]], then governor of Bihar. His master was impressed by his service and devotion. Bahar Khan conferred on him the title of '''Sher Khan''' for having shown gallantry in killing a [[tiger]] single-handed. Later, Sher Khan was appointed ''[[Wakil]]'' (Governor) and also a tutor of Bahar Khan's son Jalal Khan.

Jealous of Sher Khan's success, his enemies poisoned his master's mind and he was thus deprived of his father's jagir. He joined the Babur camp where he served from April 1527 to June 1528. But soon, he left Babur and returned to Bihar and took over his old job as a guardian of Jalal Khan. Jalal Khan being a minor, Sher Khan became the virtual ruler of Bihar.

In 1531, Sher Khan asserted his independence from Humayun, Babur's successor. The unexpected rise of Sher Khan made the Lohani Afghans and Jalal Khan impatient. They even entered into an alliance with Muhammad Shah, the king of [[Bengal]]. Sher Khan defeated the Bengal king on the [[Kiul River]] in 1534. Later, he invaded Bengal and Muhammad Shah handed over him a large sum and territory to make amends. He then became the independent ruler of Bihar and Bengal.

In October 1537, ''Sher Khan'' again invaded Bengal and besieged the city of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]]. Humayun, realising the strength of the Afghan overlord, marched to oppose ''Sher Khan'' in December 1537, and besieged [[Chunar]]. However, the army of Sher Khan baffled all the attempts of the assailants for six months, which gave enough time to ''Sher Khan'' for the reduction of Gaur, which was achieved by April 1538. In 1539, as ''Humayun'' marched towards Bengal, ''Sher Khan'' cleverly occupied the Mughal territories in Bihar and [[Jaunpur]]. In 1539, ''Sher Khan'' was able to defeat ''Humayun'' in the [[Battle of Chausa]]. Again in 1540, he defeated Humayun in the [[Battle of Kannauj]], and went on to capture [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] at the age of 54.

Sher Khan built the [[Rohtas Fort]] in 1541-43 to crush the [[Gakhars]], who were loyal to [[Humayun]], to whom the fort was finally surrendered by a treacherous commander 10 years after Sher Khan's death. 

Meanwhile, in [[Marwar]] the [[Rathore]]s were becoming very powerful. The Rathore king [[Rao Maldeo Rathore|Rao Maldeo]] had extended his territory to within a couple of hundred kilometres of Delhi. In 1544 Sher Khan attacked Maldeo. Maldeo came with a force of 40 thousand against Sher Khan's 60 thousand. In the evening Sher Khan sent forged letters to Maldeo's camp. These letters seemed to indicate that some generals from Maldeo's army were buying arms from Sher Khan's army. This caused great consternation in Maldeo's camp who thought that some of his generals had crossed over to Sher Khan, and he left with 20,000 men. Later events proved that there was no crossing over by Maldeo's generals. When the Rathore generals Kumpa (his progeny are [[Kumpawat]] Rathores) and Jaita (his progeny are [[Jaitawat]] Rathores) found out what happened they did not lose their cool, and decided they would not leave the field even though they just had 20 thousand men and had to face Sher Khan's 60 thousand Pashtuns. In the ensuing [[battle of Sammel]] Sher Khan emerged victorious, but several of his generals lost their lives and his army suffered heavy losses. After this he commented that "for a few grains of [[bajra]] (a grain crop that grows in Marwar) he had almost lost the entire kingdom of India".

==Expansion and victories==
[[Image:Sasaram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The mausoleum of Sher Shah Suri in Sasaram, Bihar]]

Sher Khan continued to expand his empire, subjugating Bengal, [[Malwa]], [[Raisen]], [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]].  In the [[Battle of Raisen]], Sher Khan attacked the fort of the [[Rajput]] ruler [[Puran Mal]]. After it became apparent that defending the fort would be too tough, Puran Mal agreed to surrender the fort on the condition that his troops, their wives and children, be allowed to leave unmolested. Sher Khan agreed. But as Puran Mal and his family were leaving the fort they were attacked by Sher Khan's [[Pashtuns]].

In a very short time, Sher Khan had extended his kingdom from the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the west to Bengal in the east. He then besieged the strong fort of [[Kalinjar]] in [[Bundelkhand]], where he later died in an accidental explosion of [[gunpowder]] in May 1545.

Sher Shah Suri was succeeded by his son, Jalal Khan who took the title of [[Islam Shah Suri]].

He adopted the self-appointed title of '''Shah''' during his rivalry with [[Humayun]] in anticipation of power, so his name was again changed from Sher Khan to Sher Shah. In his reign, Sher Shah conquered a large portion of India.

==حکومت او مديريت==
Though Sher Shah ruled for only 5 years yet he introduced important administrative reforms, which produced an excellent revenue system. His reforms were accepted by later [[Mughal]] and British colonial administrations. His administration was efficient, but somewhat tight. The empire was divided into 47 provinces called ''[[Sarkar]]s'', and each was subdivided into several smaller districts called ''[[Pargana]]s''. Each Pargana had its own group of officers called ''Shiqdar-i-Shiqdaram'' and a second group called ''Munsif-i-Munsifan''. Every pargana had one military officer, one treasurer, one judicial judge and two accountants, who maintained accounts in both Persian and in Hindi. Sher Shah transferred these officers around every two or three years to prevent any undue influence of officers in one place. He paid attention to improvement of trade, abolishing all taxes which hindered progress of free trade. He built large network of roads. One road ran from [[Attock]] to [[Dacca]], second ran from Agra to [[Burhanpur]], third from Agra to [[Chittor]] and fourth between [[Lahore]] and [[Multan]]. Present [[Grand Trunk Road]] in [[Pakistan]] was built by Sher Shah Suri. In order to stay in power, Sher Shah created an efficient network of spies. He was also strict on crime. He even punished his relatives if they were found guilty by the courts.

Sher Shah Suri was a visionary ruler and introduced many military and civil reforms. One of his important innovations was the introduction of the '''''Rupayya''''' or [[rupee]] coin in place of “Tanka” and “Jeetal” that were introduced by Turks.; the same name is still used for official coinage in [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Maldives]], [[Seychelles]] among other countries. He was the first in South Asia to introduce [[custom duties]], which are still followed up to this day. He undertook extensive repairs of major roads and for travellers' comfort constructed resthouses and places for drinking-water along the road.

Sher Shah Suri was, thus, indeed a great ruler. His administrative policies and other policies were so efficient that [[Akbar]], the greatest of the Mughals, followed almost all of them. So, Sher Shah is rightly regarded as the 'forerunner of Akbar'. His genius and chivalry was recognised by his former foe [[Humayun]], who upon hearing of Sher Shah's passing, referred to him as "Ustad-i-Badshahan" (Master of Kings).<ref name="Khan">Dr.Khan, Hussain (1994) Sher Shah Suri 1540-1545</ref>
                       
As far as his revenue and agricultural reforms, he was the first one among the kings of Delhi to start land measurement, categorize cultivated land according to its product, and implement a new revenue system. He made a farmer friendly policy of agricultural loans called “Taqavi system”. He also used his experience of managing his own Jageer at Sasaram. 
He introduced system of “Sarkars”, “Parganas” and villages in place of provinces. “Shiqdars” governed Sarkars whereas Parganas were under minor Shiqdars called “Shiqdaran”. There were “Munsifan” in Sarkars and Munsifs in Parganas to run judicial functions. Munsifan also resolved disputes between Sarkar and Pargana. There was a “Qanoongo” in each Sarkar who was the supervisor of records of property. “Fautedar” kept records both in Persian and Hindi.

Sher Shah used spying as a tool to be aware of woes of people, and established an efficient postal system in which horses carried mail to inns that were at equal distances of 12 miles from each other. These inns served also as post offices and spying centres and it was the duty of respective villages to bear expenses of their inns.

He was the first one to keep the military away from political and social issues in the empire. He made cantonment areas and deployed there a large army under a commander called “Faujdar”. He crushed the frontier Pashtun tribes, Balochs, Rajputs, Gakkhars and Khokhars while chasing Mughals out of India in his brief rule of five years. He also joined, Multan, Bengal, Burhanpur and Jotepur with Agra through the famous Grand Trunk road. Sher Shah followed the branding and “Huliya” systems of [[Alauddin Khilji]] to avoid forgery done by Nobles. He also established a standing army with regular salaries, instead of dividing war booty. 

One of the most appreciated steps taken by Sher Shah was building inns, mosques and roads, planting trees, digging wells, spending money on “Ulema” and “Madarsas” and helped the poor and needy. He established free kitchens at various places in his empire and spent 500 Ashrafis on them daily. These steps place him equal to [[Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] considered as a kind-hearted ruler by the historians like Ziaud Din Barni and Shams Afif in Tareekh-e-Feroz Shahi. 

Sher Shah Suri appears before us as a nation builder who allowed not only Muslims but also Buddhists and Hindus to enjoy all opportunities. He tried to establish a national government, which shows that he followed the policy of [[Alauddin Khilji]] who, for the first time, employed Hindus as soldiers as well as revenue collectors. Sher Shah united Afghans living in India and revived them as a power in the subcontinent. However, this unity and strength ended with the end of his life when he laid siege to Kalinjar in 1545.

Sher Shah was a military genius because he knew the war strategies of Afghans and Mughals and used his own delaying tactics of long negotiations and misleading the enemy. He defeated Humayun by using the same tactics in both wars of Chausa and Kannauj in 1539 and 1540 respectively. Sher Shah’s theory of kingship and his rules of war depict him as a shrewd ruler. According to him, justice was not only to be dispensed to believers but also infidels. Sher Shah once punished his own son on his bad conduct.

Sher Shah had a refined taste in architecture. He built mosques and inns around India, and cities sprang up along the highways he built. A mosque in Delhi and his own mausoleum are sound proof of his refined taste. Another is the construction of the fort of Rohtas-e-Nau on the Jhelum. 

Sher Shah was a great critic of “Mughal administration” and used this term wherever he found administrative flaws. He seized power when he was 54 but even at this old age, he was active and hard worker. According to Razzaq Mushtaqi and Abbass Sherwani, both contemporary historians, Sher Shah used to get up early for “Fajr” prayers and inspected branding of horses, helped the poor and needy and then held court. He himself used to say:
“Alas! When I seized the power it was twilight of my life.” 

The hardships faced by Sher Shah were no less than that of Humayun. Like Humayun, he faced opposition from stepbrothers, had many rivals whom he overcame, and had no money in the treasury at the beginning of his rule. Even then, he gave a completely new structure of government along with a revenue system for a permanent source of income.
