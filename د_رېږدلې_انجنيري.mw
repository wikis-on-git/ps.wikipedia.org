'''زلزلې انجینري''' د انجینرۍ هغه څانګه ده چې د زلزلې او د هغه څخه د راولاړو طبیعي ناورینونو د څیړلو، مخنیوي، لاملونو، او نورو په برخه کې کار کوي. پخوا به د زلزلې انجینري داسې تعریف کیده چې د ودانیو او ځمکنیو جوړښتونو کړه د زلزلې پر وړاندې څیړي او را پیژني. لدې امله وروسته دغه څانګه د دواړو ودانیو انجینريstructural engineering  او ځمکپیژندنې geotechnical engineering د ټولګې په توګه وپیژندل شوه.

د زلزلې انجینرۍ موخې دادي:
* د سختو زلزلو د پایلو او ورانیو وړاندوینه اغیز چې په ښاري سیمو او بنسټیزو ساختمانونو ېې اچوي.
* د ودانونې او جوړونې د کوډونو پر بنسټ ولاړ نوې ودانۍ ډیزان،جوړې او ترمیم کړي ترڅو د تمې سره سم د پیښیدونکو زلزلو پر وړاندې کلک او ښه مقاومت ولري.

یو انجیمري تعمیر اړینه نده چې باید بیخي زیات کلک او غیر اقتصادي وي. بلکه باید د امکان تر بریده اقتصادي او تر ټاکلي یا په پام کې نیول شوي بریده د سیمې د مکررو زلزلو پر وړاندې کلک او هم څه ناڅه نړیدنه پکې رامنځ ته شي.

== د زلزلې بار ==

د زلزلې بار اچونه '''یعنې ودانۍ یا بل هر سترکچر ته د زلزلې پوسیله د منځ ته راغلی خوځښت ورکول'''. دغه بار ودانۍ ته د ځمکې پر مخ،او یا هم د کوم بل سترکچر پرسر لکه پر پل د زلزلې بار د هغې د ستنو د پاسه ور تپل کیږي.


== د زلزلې پر وړاندې د ودانۍ کړه ==
'''زلزله''' او یا د '''زلزلې پر وړاندې د ودانۍ کړه'''(seismic performance) د ودانۍ هغه ځواک ښيي چې د پیښې شوې زلزلې پرمهال خپل کړه څرګند کړي. د بیلګې په توګه د زلزلې د پیښیدو او د هغې وروسته باید ودانۍ خوندي، او د کارونې وړ وي. یوه ودانۍ هغه مهال خوندي ''safe'' بلل کیږي چې پکې استوګن او شاوخوا خلکو ژوند په خطر کې وا نه چوي. چې دا خطر د بشپړ او یا هم ځنو برخو د نړیدو له کبله وي.
یوه ودانۍ هغه وخت د کارونې وړ ''serviceable'' بلل کیږي چې ورته پام کې نیولې ځانګړتیاوې ېې په پوره توګه د کار وړ وي او یا نه وي زیانمنې شوې.




=== د زلزلې پر وړاندې د کړو ارزونه ===
انجینران باید پوه شي چې د یوې ټاکلې زلزلې د خوځښت پر وړاندې یوه ودانۍ په څومره کچه خپل کړه ترسره کولی شي. دغه ارزونه هم په تجربي او هم په شننیزه یا تحلیلي توګه ترسره کیږي.


====تجربي ارزونه====
په تجربي ډول ارزونه تل زیات لګښت لري. پدې ډول ارزونه کې د یوې ودانۍ بیلګه یا ماډل د یو ځانګړي سکیل سره جوړیږي، او بیا په لړزونکي میز باندې مصنوعي زلزله ورکول کیږي، پدې توګه د زلزلې پر وړاندې د دغه ودانۍ کړه ارزوي.

[[File:Shaking NDC.jpg|thumb|698 × 480 px|left|د وچ-کلک (کړسن) شپږ پوړیزه کانکریټي ودانۍ آزمایښت د لړزونکي میز پر سر]]

داچې دغه ډول آزمایښتونه زیات لګښت ته اړتیا لري ترڅو د یوې ودانۍ ارزونه وکړي؛ غوره پیتیل شوېده چې ددې کار لپاره د باور وړ موډلونه او د شننې لارې چارې رامنځ ته او د هغوی پر دقت او کره والي کار وکړي. کله چې د باور وړ کره موډلونه او د شننې لارې رامنڅ ته شوې، دغه لارې بیا د تجربي آزمایښتونو پر ځای کاروي چې پدې توګه د زلزلې پر وړاندې د یوې ودانۍ د ارزولو بیه ډیره ارزانه پریوزي.

====شننیز یا تحلیلي ارزونه====

شننیزه ارزونه یا د ودانۍ شننه چې انګریزي کې ورته (seismic structural analysis) وايي، د زلزلې انجینرۍ یوه پیاوړې وسیله ده چې د هغې پر مټ د ودانیو مشرح موډلونونو وړتیا د ودانیو د شننې په کارولو سره معلوموي؛ او د زلزلې پر وړاندې د ودانۍ د کړو د ښه پوهاوي په برخه کې ډیر اغیزمن پریوزي.

په ټوله کې د ودانیو شننه پر ساختماني ډینامیکس چې انګریزي کې ورته  [[structural dynamics]].<ref name=DynamicsOfStructures>{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author=Chopra, Anil K.|year=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-855214-2}}</ref> .[1]) وايي، ولاړه ده. د زلزلې د شننې ترټولو مخکښه وسیله د ځواب سپکټرون یا  [[response spectrum]] لاره ده.

که څه هم داډول لارې د ارتجاعي سیستمونو لپاره ښې دي، خو کله چې یوه ودانۍ ډیره سخته زیانمنه شي د هغې د کړه بیا د غیر ارتجاعي یا ([[non-linearity]]) په بڼه څرګندیږي. د ګام-په-ګام انټګرال شننیزه لار د یوې ګټورې وسیلې او لارې په توګه د څو-درجې-آزادۍ لرونکو ودانیو د شننې لپاره پیژندل شویده.

په لنډ ډول، د ودانۍ شننه ددې لپاره ترسره کیږي ترڅو د هغې کړه د زلزلې پر وړاندې و ارزوي. د ودانۍ د کړو ارزونه د غیر ارتجاعي سټاټیک پوش اور (nonlinear static pushover) شننې او یا هم (nonlinear time-history analysis) شننې په ترسره کولو سره په لاس راځي. ددې لارو د پلي کولو لپاره اړینه ده چې لمړی د ودانۍ د غړو لکه ستنه (column)، تیر (beams) غوټه (beam-column joint) او دیوال (shear wall) یو وړ او مناسب غیر ارتجاعي موډل برابر شي. د کره موډلونو د پیژندلو او برابرولو په برخه کې تجربي پایلې ښه مرسته کولی شي ترڅو د هر غړي کره موډل په تیره بیا د هغه غړو چې زیات غیر ارتجاعي بدلون (deformations) ېې موندلی وي پیدا او تیار کړی شو. د هر غړي غیر ارتجاعي موډلونه بیا یو د بل سره تړل کیږي ترڅو د ټولې ودانۍ غیر ارتجاعي موډل ترې لاسته راشي. او لاسته راغلی موډل بیا شنل کیږي ترڅو د ودانۍ د کړو ارزونه ېې وشي.

په اوسني وخت کې پورته یادو چارو لپاره کمپیوټري پروګرامونه ډیر زیات کار کولی شي. په بازار کې بې شمیره سوداګریز پوستکالي (software) شته چې ددې موخې لپاره کاریدی شي د بیلګې په توګه: CSI-SAP2000، CSI-PERFORM-3D او نور. همداراز پر څیړنه-ولاړ (research-based) کمپیوټري پوستکالي پدې برخه کې د لاس رسي وړ دي لکه :RUAUMOKO ،OpenSees او DRAIN-2D/3D، چې د پرانیستې سرچینې (open source) په ډول ورته لاس رسی کیدی شي.

== د زلزلې انجینرۍ اړوند څیړنې ==

[[File:FPB testing-1.jpg|thumb|800 × 1,183 px|left|د لړزونکي میز پر سر د یوې ودانۍ د موډل آزمایښت]]
پدې برخه کې څیړنې او ګویږنې په شننیز او تجربي توګه ترسره کیږي ترڅو د زلزلې انجینرۍ اړوند بیلابیلو برخو کې ښه، کره، علمي موندنو لاس بري وشي. پدې توګه به د شته منل شوو معیارونو بیا کتنه او سمونه د نوو موندنو په رڼا کې ترسره او د پلي کیدو په ډګر کې پوره آسانتیاوې او کره توب رامنځ ته شي.


Earthquake Engineering Research Institute یا (EERI) د زلزلې انجینرۍ په څیړنیزو چارو کې مخکښه اداره ده چې هم په متحده ایالتونو او هم په نړیواله کچه فعالیت کوي.

په نړیواله کچه د زلزلې اړوند څیړنې په لاندې مرکزونو او یا د دوی تر سیوري لاندې ترسره کیږي:

=== د زلزلې موډل کول ===
د زلزلې موډل کول یا (Earthquake simulation) د لمړي ځل لپاره د یوې افقي قوې پر واردولو سره چې په واقعیت کې د ودانۍ د عطالت قوه  ده ترسره شو. پدې موډل کې د ځمکې د خوځښت تعجیل په سکیل شوې بڼه د ودانۍ پر ریاضیکي موډل وارد شوی و. را وروسته بیا د محاسبوي تکنالوژۍ د پرمختګ سره د ډینامیک شننې لپاره ګام واخیستل شو.

د ودانیو ډینامیکي شننه کیدای شي تجربي وی لکه د لړزونکي میز پر سره د ودانیو د د موډلونو لړزول، او یا هم خیالي () لکه د ریاضیکي موډلونو شننه. په دواړو حالتونو کې موخه داده چې د ودانۍ کړه د زلزلې پر وړاندې ښکاره او و ارزوي. ځنې څیړونکي د 

کله کله د زلزلې موډل کول یا (earthquake simulation) د ځواکمنې زلزلې د لړزې څخه د را ولاړو اغیزو د بیا جوړونې یا (re-creation) په ډول تعریف کیږي.


[[File:Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table.jpg|thumb|383 × 248 px|right|Large High Performance Outdoor [[Earthquake shaking table|Shake Table]], [[UCSD]], NEES network]]

=== د ودانۍ موډل کول ===
د یوې ودانۍ د کړو د ارزونې لپاره هغه که په نظري توګه وي او که په تجربي، د یادې ودانۍ موډل کولو ته اړتیا پیښیږي. دغه موډل کول د ودانیز ورته والي (structural likeness or similarity) پر بنسټ ولاړ وي. دغه ورته والی کیدای شي د دوه څیزونو د پوره برابرۍ او یا هم د اصلي څیز د یوې اټکلي څیرې په توګه ومنل شي.


[[File:Kinematically equivalent building models on a shake-table.jpg|thumb|1,167 × 567 px|left|د دوه ورته ودانیو موډلونه په لړزونکي میز، چې یو ېې بیس-آیزولیشن او بل ېې معمولي ودانۍ ده]]

د یوې ودانۍ موډل هغه وخت ورته بلل کیږي چې د اصلي ودانۍ سره په هندسي بڼه ''geometric similarity''، حرکي بڼه ''kinematic similarity'' او ډینامیکي بڼه ''dynamic similarity'' کې ورته والی ولري. ترټولو اغیزمن ورته والی حرکي ورته والی دی.  حرکي ورته والی هغه وخت منځ ته راځي چې د اصلي ودانۍ او موډل خوځښت لار او د خوځښت تیزوالی یا سرعت ډیر سره نږدې او ورته وي.

د حرکي ورته والي تر ټولو لوړه کچه داده چې، د خوځښت پر مهال د ودانۍ او د هغه د موډل د هر پوړ اړخیز بیځایښت (lateral displacements) یوشان وي.

== د زلزلې د ږیدیدا کنټرول ==
د زلزلې د ریږدیدا کنټرول د څو تخنیکي مفاهیمو ټولګه ده چې موخه ېې پر ودانیو باندې د زلزلې د اغیز کمول دي. هغه وسیلې چې د ریږدیدا د کنټرول لپاره کارول کیږي په لاندې دریو ډلو ویشل کیږي (۱) مړه، (۲) کارنده او (۳) هابرایډ (hybrid).

٭ مړه کنټرولونکي وسیله د بیرته ځواب یا [[feedback]] ځواک نلري.

٭ کارنده کنټرولونکي وسیله په ودانۍ کې د ننه په پرمختللو وسایلو سمبال ده چې د ځمکې ور کړ شوی خوځښت پروسس کوي.

٭ هایبرایډ کنټرولونکې وسیله بیا د پورته یادو دواړو ځانګړتیاوې لري.

کله چې د ځمکې پر مخ د زلزلې څپې راشي، او هڅه کوي چې د ودانۍ بیخ ته ننوځي- د دغه څپو د انرژۍ د جریان تکاثف د انعکاس له امله په زیاته کچه معمولاً تر 90٪ پورې کمیږي. سره ددې هم په ډیرو ځواکمنو زلزلو کې دغه پاته انرژي د زیاتو ورانیو او خرابیو سبب کیږي.

کله چې د ځمکې څپې یوې ودانۍ ته ننوځي، دلته زیاتې لارې چارې شتون لري چې دوی کنټرول کړي ترڅو د زیاتو ورانیو مخه ېې ونیول شي؛ د بیلګې په توګه د انرژي زبیښونکي یا (Energy Dissippator) ډمپر پوسیله د یادو څپو انرژي د ودانۍ په دننه کې زبیښي.

او ځنې وسیلې د یادو څپو انرژي د زیات شمیر فریکونسیو ترمنځ ویشي چې پدې توګه ېې زور کمیږي.
او کله کله هم د کتلوي ډمپر پوسیله د زلزلې د څپو د تکراري برخې د فریکونسیو بانډ زبیښي.


[[File:Cyrus tomb.jpg|thumb|600 × 387 px|[[Mausoleum]] of Cyrus, د نړۍ تر ټولو لرغونی تعمیر چې د بیس-آیزولیشن پر سر جوړ شویدی]]
دا وروستي وسایل ېې د مخففاتو په ډول هر یو TMD (د مړه کنټرولونکي)، AMD (د فعال کنټرولونکي) او HMD (د هایبرایډ کنټرولونکي) لپاره کارول کیږي. یاد وسایل د څه باندې دیرشو کلونو راپدې خوا په جاپان کې په پراخه کچه څیړل کیږي، تولیدیږي او کارول کیږي.

ددې ترڅنګ د زلزلې د بار د کمولو په موخه یوه بله لار هم شته چې د هغې په مرسته ودانۍ ته د زلزلې د انرژۍ (څپو) د مخه په نسبي توګه نیول کیږي. د اصلي ودانۍ او د هغه د بار اخیستونکو بنسټونو ترمنځ نرم ربړي مواد کاروي ترڅو ټوله ودانۍ د ځمکې څخه بیله او پدې توګه د زلزلې د څپو له اغیز څخه په نسبي توګه خوندي وساتي. دا لاره د بیس-آیزولیشن په نوم یادیږي.

د بیس-آیزولیشن لمړنۍ نښې نښانې په لرغوني پارس کې لیدل شویدي. چې تر میلاد مخکې شپږمې پیړۍ ته ورګرځي.


=== وچ ډبرین دیوال ===
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|left|د مچو پیچو معبد چې وچ ډبرین دیوالونه لري]]
د انکا تمدن خلک د وچ ډبرین دیوال وتلي خټګر خلک و. دوی به ډیرې داسې پرې کولې چې یو د بل پرمخ ډیرې ښې پریوزي بې لدې چې کومه مساله ېې ترمنځ ور زیاته کړي. ډبرې به په دومره کره توګه ایښودل کیدې چې د دوی ترمنځ درزونو کې د سابو د شنه کیدو یا را وتلو امکان هم هیڅ نه ترسترګو کیده.

د پیرو هیواد یو زلزله لرونکی هیواد دی. او دغه بې مسالې ډبرین دیوالونه د پیړیو را پدیخوا هغو په پرتله چې مساله پکې کارول شویده ډیر کلک او محکم دریدلي پاته شویدي. ددې خبرې راز پدې کې نغښتی دی چې د انکا خلکو به د ډبرو مخونه ښوی پرې کول او پدې توګه به د زلزلې پر وخت دا ډبرې یو د بل پر مخ لږ-لږ خوځیدې چې پدې توګه ېې د زلزلې انرژي وژله.


=== د  سرپ او ربړ تکیه ===
[[File:LRBtest.jpg|thumb|592 × 445 pxLRB د آزمایښت پر مهال]]

د سرپ او ربړ تکیه یا ('''Lead Rubber Bearing''') چې لدې وروسته به په لنډ ډول (LRB) بلل کیږي، د بیس-آیزولیشن یو ډول دی چې د زیات [[damping]]   لرونکی دی. (LRB) د لمړي ځل لپاره د زیلاندي بیل رابینسون ([[William Robinson (scientist)|Bill Robinson]]) لخوا اختراع شوی و.

د زیات (damping) میکانیزم چې د لړزې د کنټرول په تکنالوژۍ کې او په ځانګړې توګه په بیس-آیزولیشن کې ترې کار اخیستل کیږي، د لړزې د کمولو یوه ښه وسیله او همداراز د زلزلې پر وړاندې د ودانیو د ښه کړو د لاسته راوړلو سرچینه ده.

د (LRB) په مرسته نن د نړۍ په ګوټ ګوټ کې ودانۍ او پلونه د زلزلې پر وړاندې ډیزاین شویدی.

=== د ځوړنده کتلې ډمپر ===

 [[File:Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damper.png|thumb|922 × 769 px|left|د تاپي 101 دنګه ودانۍ چې په ځوړندې کتلې ډمپر سمبال ده]]
لکه څنګه چې د نوم څخه ېې ښکاري، دا ډول ډمپر [[tuned mass damper]] د یوې لوېې ګاګریزې (کانکریټي) کتلې څخه عبارت ده چې د ودانۍ په سر، منځ او یا بل موقعیت کې را ځوړنده وي او د زلزلې پر وخت د ودانۍ د خوځښت پر مخالف جهت باندې حرکت کوي او پدې توګه د ودانۍ زیات بیځایښت مخه نیسي.

د تاپي 101 دنګه ودانۍ باید د باد، بړبوکۍ او سختې زلزلې پر وړاندې کلک ولاړ وي. په همدې موخه ددغه ودانۍ په 92 م  او 88 م پوړ کې 660 میتریک ټنه کتلې راځوړندې دي. دغه درنې کتلې د ودانۍ د اړخیز خوځښت پر مهال د ودانۍ د خوځښت پر مخالف جهت خوځیږي او پدې توګه د زلزلې پوسیله رامنځ ته شوی خوځښت په ودانۍ کې کموي.

=== اصطکاکي خوځنده تکیه ===
[[File:FPB testing.jpg|thumb|1,024 × 768 px|right|]]


اصطکاکي خوځنده تکیه یا ('''Friction Pendulum Bearing'''(FPB))  د زلزلې د غیز کمونکو وسایلو څخه یو دی. اصطکاکي خوځنده تکیه د دریو مهم برخو څخه جوړه شویده:



٭ ښوی اصطکاکي خوځنده یا (articulated friction slider)؛

٭ کروي ډوله سطح چې اصطکاکي خوځنده پکې یو خوا بل خوا حرکت کولی شي (spherical concave sliding surface)؛

٭ د زیات اړخیز بیځایښت مخه نیونکی یا enclosing cylinder for lateral displacement restraint.

په ښي اړخ کې انځور د لړزونکي میز پر سر د یوې ودانۍ موډل چې د (FPB) د پاسه جوړ شوی ښودل شویدی.

=== د ودانۍ د لوړوالي کنټرول ===
[[File:TransamericaPyramidFromTI.jpg|thumb|1,067 × 2,594 px|left|هرم ډوله ودانۍ]]

د ودانۍ د لوړوالي کنټرول (Building elevation control ) هم د لړزې د کنټرولو ښه وسیله ده. هرم ډول دنګې ودانۍ چې نن سبا ېې د مهندسانو او انجینرانو پاملرنه ځانته اړولې ده، د خپل پراخ بنسټ او نرۍ څوکې په درلودو سره د باد او زلزلې پر وړاندې ښه ځواب ویونکي دي. د لوړوالي دغه ډول ددې سبب کیږي چې د ودانۍ د نوسان د زیاتوالي مخه ونیسي ځکه پدې ډول ودانیو کې د پریکون د قوې د څپو (sheer wave) انرژي د زیاتو فریکونسیو ترمنځ تیت او پرک کیږي.

د ودانۍ کنډو کنډو بڼه یا (tapered profile) ددغه میتود جبري لاره نده چې ودانۍ پرې کنټرول شي. په ورته ډول د نوسان د مخنیوي لپاره کولی شو د ودانۍ په نورو ځانګړنو کې کنډوالی یا کمښت راوستل شي د بیلګې په توګه د کتلې او سختۍ ویش د ودانۍ په لوړوالی کې پداسې ډول چې زیاته کتله او سختي په لاندینیو پوړونو او نسبتا لږ کتله او لږ سختي په پورته پوړونو کې په پام کې ونیول شي  (د سختۍ او کتلې ویش د هرم په ډول په پام کې ونیول شي).



=== ساده رغړنده یا چورلنډۍ تکیه===
ساده رغړنده یا چورلنډۍ تکیه (Simple roller bearing ) د بیس-آیزولیشن یوه آله ده چې ډیری ودانۍ د زلزلې او یا بل اړخیز بار له زیان څخه خوندي ساتي.

دغه اوسپنیزه یا فلزي تکیه د ځنو نسبي خطرونو سره سره د دنګو ودانیو لپاره چې په نرمه ځمکه ودانیږي د بیس-آیزولیشن په توګه منل شویده. دغه وسیله همدا سږ کال (2012) د جاپان په ټوکیو کې د یوې 17 پوړیزه ودانۍ په بنسټ کې د فلزي رغړنده تکیه (Metallic Roller Bearing) په نوم کارول شویدی.


=== د فنر او ډمپر بیس –آیزولیشن ===
[[File:GERB spring with damper.jpg|thumb|956 × 980 px|right|Springs-with-damper close-up]]

د فنر او ډمپر بیس –آیزولیشن (Springs-with-damper base isolator) د دری پوړیزې ودانۍ لاندې په کلیفورنیا کې کارول شویدی. دغه ودانۍ د 1994 کال د نارثریج زلزلې (Northridge earthquake) هم لړزولې ده. ددې د بیس آیزولیشن ډول د سرپي-ربړي تکیې سره ورته والی لري.

له هغو دریو ودانیو څخه چې د پورته ودانۍ سره ورته وې، د زلزلې د عمودي او افقي تعجیل د ثبت کولو په وسایلو سمبالې وې او د نارثتریج د زلزلې څخه خوندي پاته شوې چې د نن لپاره د پام وړ ثبت شوي معلومات پریښودل چې د هغوی پر مټ نن نورې څیړنې پرمخ روانې دي.

=== Hysteretic damper ===
ددغه ډمپر په درلودو سره ودانۍ د زلزلې پر وړاندې  ډیر ښه او د ویسا وړ کړه ترلاسه کوي- ودانۍ ته د زلزلې ننوتې انرژي شوپشو کوي یا تیت او پرک کوي.

دغه ډمپر په څلورو لویو ډلو ویشل شویدي:

٭ اوبلن سریښناک ډمپر یا Fluid viscous dampers (FVDs)

٭ د فلز د تسلیمیدو ډمپر یا Metallic yielding dampers (MYDs)

٭ ارتجاعي سریښناک ډمپر یا Viscoelastic dampers (VEDs)

٭ اصطکاکي ډمپر یا Friction dampers (FDs)

د پورته یادو ډلو څخه هره یوه ېې بیلې ځانګړنې، ښه توبونه، او بد توبونه لري.

== Seismic design ==

'''Seismic design''' is based on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to [[design]] or [[seismic retrofit|retrofit]] structures subject to earthquake exposure.<ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures>{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Building Structures|author=Lindeburg, Michael R.; Baradar, Majid|year=2001|publisher=Professional Publications|isbn=0-943198-23-2}}</ref> Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about [[earthquake engineering structures]].<ref name=EarthquakeDesignCriteria>{{cite book|title= Earthquake Design Criteria|author=Housner, George W.; Jennings, Paul C.|year=1982|publisher=EERI|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}</ref> Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |title=Earthquake-Resistant Construction |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>

The price of poor seismic design may be enormous. Nevertheless, seismic design has always been a [[trial and error]] process whether it was based on physical laws or on empirical knowledge of the [[seismic performance|structural performance]] of different shapes and materials.

To build up complex structural systems,<ref name=SeismicDesignHandbook>{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Handbook|author=Edited by Farzad Naeim|year=1989|publisher=VNR|isbn=0-442-26922-6}}</ref> seismic design largely uses the same relatively small number of basic structural elements (to say nothing of vibration control devices) as any non-seismic design project.

Normally, according to building codes, structures are designed to "withstand" the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings.

Seismic design is carried out by understanding the possible [[failure mode]]s of a structure and providing the structure with appropriate [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], [[ductility]], and [[configuration (geometry)|configuration]]<ref name=BuildingConfiguration>{{cite book|title= Building Configuration & Seismic Design|author=Arnold, Christopher; Reitherman, Robert|year=1982|publisher=A Wiley-Interscience Publication|isbn=0-471-86138-3}}</ref> to ensure those modes cannot occur.

=== Seismic design requirements ===
'''Seismic design requirements''' depend on the type of the structure, locality of the project and its authorities which stipulate applicable seismic design codes and criteria.<ref name="RecommendedLateralForce"/> For instance, [[California Department of Transportation]]'s requirements called ''The Seismic Design Criteria'' (SDC) and aimed at the design of new bridges in California<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/earthquake_engineering/SDC/SDCPage.html |title=Template for External Caltrans Pages |publisher=Dot.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref> incorporate an innovative seismic performance based approach.

[[File:Metsamor aerien.jpg|thumb|[[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Armenia]] was closed after the 1988 destructive earthquake<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asbarez.com/2007/12/07/strategy-to-close-metsamor-plant-presented |title=Strategy to Close Metsamor Plant Presented &#124; Asbarez Armenian News |publisher=Asbarez.com |date=1995-10-26 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref> ]]The most significant feature in the SDC design philosophy is a shift from a ''force-based assessment'' of seismic demand to a ''displacement-based assessment'' of demand and capacity. Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the ''elastic displacement'' demand to the ''inelastic displacement'' capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential plastic hinge locations.

In addition to the designed structure itself, seismic design requirements may include a ''ground stabilization'' underneath the structure: sometimes, heavily shaken ground breaks up which leads to collapse of the structure sitting upon it.<ref>{{cite web|author=neesit |url=http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&feature=PlayList&p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 - YouTube |publisher=Es.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>
The following topics should be of primary concerns: liquefaction; dynamic lateral earth pressures on retaining walls; seismic slope stability; earthquake-induced settlement.<ref name=GeoEarthquakeEngineering>{{cite book|title= Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering Handbook|author=Robert W. Day|year=2007|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-137782-4}}</ref>

[[Nuclear facility|Nuclear facilities]] should not jeopardise their safety in case of earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities.<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf18.html Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes]</ref> The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and [[2011 Japanese nuclear incidents|damage to other nuclear facilities]] that followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Japanese nuclear seismic design standards]] and caused other many governments to [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents#Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs|re-evaluate their nuclear programs]]. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in France.

=== Failure modes ===

'''Failure mode''' is the manner by which an earthquake induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes the way the failure occurs. Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in ''seismic design'' methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.

Severely cracked or leaning walls are some of the most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.

Absence of adequate [[shear wall]]s on the ground level caused damage to this structure. A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a [[brick veneer]], has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the [[Structural rigidity|rigidity]] of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.

[[File:Liquefaction at Niigata.JPG|thumb|500 × 297 px|left|Effects of [[soil liquefaction]] during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]]]]'''[[Soil liquefaction]]'''. In the cases where the soil consists of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, [[liquefaction]] of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform [[Consolidation (soil)|settlements]] and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake|1964 earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|author=neesit |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&feature=PlayList&p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>

[[File:Smashed Car in Dujiangyan - 2008 Sichuan earthquake (1).jpg|thumb|800 × 532 px|right|Car smashed by [[landslide]] rock, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]]]'''Landslide rock fall'''. A [[landslide]] is a geological phenomenon which includes a wide range of ground movement, including '''rock falls'''. Typically, the action of [[gravity]] is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur though in this case there was another contributing factor which affected the original [[slope stability]]: the landslide required an ''earthquake trigger'' before being released.

This is a photograph of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, [[Los Altos, California]] which resulted in one fatality. During [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.

Thus, [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|the Indian Ocean earthquake]] of December 26, 2004, with the [[epicenter]] off the west coast of [[Sumatra]], Indonesia, triggered a series of devastating tsunamis, killing more than 230,000 people in eleven countries by '''inundating surrounding coastal communities with huge waves''' up to 30 meters (100&nbsp;feet) high. For a video footage of the tsunami propagation, click on.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ygYqj4rVM&feature=Pl</ref>

== Earthquake-Resistant construction ==
'''Earthquake construction''' means implementation of '''seismic design''' to enable building and non-building structures to live through the anticipated earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with the applicable [[building code]]s.[[File:2009 03 03 Pearl River Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of [[Pearl River Tower]] X-bracing to resist lateral forces of earthquakes and winds]]

Design and construction are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing of the members and their connections should be as simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.<ref name=BridgeDesign>{{cite book|title=Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance
|author=Edited by Dr. Robert Lark|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-3593-4}}</ref>

The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be ''direct'' (seismic motion of the ground) or ''indirect'' (earthquake-induced landslides, [[soil liquefaction]] and waves of tsunami).

A structure might have all the appearances of stability, yet offer nothing but danger when an earthquake occurs.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24993357/</ref> The crucial fact is that, for safety, earthquake-resistant construction techniques are as important as [[quality control]] and using correct materials. ''Earthquake contractor'' should be [[registered company|registered]] in the state of the project location, [[bond (finance)|bonded]] and [[insured]].

To minimize possible [[earthquake loss|losses]], construction process should be organized with keeping in mind that earthquake may strike any time prior to the end of construction.

Each [[construction project]] requires a qualified team of professionals who understand the basic features of seismic performance of different structures as well as [[construction management]].

=== Adobe structures ===
[[File:Adobe structure.jpg|thumb|394 × 600 px|right|Partially collapsed adobe building in Westmorland, [[California]]]]Around thirty percent of the world's population lives or works in earth-made construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eartharchitecture.org/|title=Earth Architecture - the Book, Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref> [[Adobe]] type of [[mud brick]]s is one of the oldest and most widely used building materials. The use of [[adobe]] is very common in some of the world's most hazard-prone regions, traditionally across Latin America, Africa, Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia, Middle East and Southern Europe.

Adobe buildings are considered very vulnerable at strong quakes.<ref>http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiqGHEOmuA&feature=PlayList&p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&index=16</ref> However, multiple ways of seismic strengthening of new and existing adobe buildings are available, see, e.g.,.<ref>http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf</ref>

Key factors for the improved seismic performance of
adobe construction are:
* Quality of construction.
* Compact, box-type layout.
* Seismic reinforcement.<ref>http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUOPY0OjlQ&feature=PlayList&p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&index=21</ref>

=== Limestone and sandstone structures ===
[[File:SLCCityAndCountyBldg.jpg|thumb|650 × 443 px|left|Base-isolated City and County Building, Salt Lake City, [[Utah]]]][[Limestone]] is very common in architecture, especially in North America and Europe. Many landmarks across the world, including the pyramids in Egypt, are made of limestone. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] masonry. They are the long-lasting materials but their rather heavy weight is not beneficial for adequate seismic performance.

Application of modern technology to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] in [[Utah]] was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an emphasis on preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.

=== Timber frame structures ===
[[File:Anne Hvides Gaard Svendborg.jpg|thumb|2,088 × 1,550 px|right|Half-timbered museum buildings, [[Denmark]], date from 1560]][[Timber framing]] dates back thousands of years, and has been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, Europe and medieval England in localities where timber was in good supply and building stone and the skills to work it were not.

The use of [[timber framing]] in buildings provides their complete skeletal framing which offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better ''seismic survivability''.<ref name=Timber>{{cite book|title= Timber Design & Construction Sourcebook=Gotz, Karl-Heinz et al.|year=1989|publisher=McGraw-Hall |isbn=0-07-023851-0}}</ref>

=== Light-frame structures ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|1,083 × 546 px|left|A two-story wooden-frame for a residential building structure]][[Light-frame construction|Light-frame structures]] usually gain seismic resistance from rigid [[plywood]] shear walls and wood structural panel [[diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]].<ref>http://nees.buffalo.edu/projects/NEESWood/video.asp</ref> Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all [[engineered wood]] structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, horizontal and vertical diaphragm shears, and [[connector]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}/[[fastener]] values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.

=== Reinforced masonry structures ===
[[File:Bond-beam.JPG|thumb|516 × 900 px|right|Reinforced hollow masonry wall]]
A construction system where [[steel reinforcement]] is embedded in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[masonry]] or placed in holes and after filled with [[concrete]] or [[grout]] is called '''reinforced masonry'''.<ref>http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm</ref>

The devastating [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed that masonry construction should be improved immediately. Then, the California State Code made the reinforced masonry mandatory.

There are various practices and techniques to achieve reinforced masonry. The most common type is the reinforced hollow unit masonry. The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal reinforcement strongly depends on the type and quality of the masonry, i.e. masonry units and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

To achieve a [[ductile]] behavior of masonry, it is necessary that the [[shear strength]] of the wall is greater than the [[flexural strength]].<ref name=SeismicMasonry>{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Masonry Using the 1997 UBC|author= Ekwueme, Chukwuma G.; Uzarski, Joe|year=2003|publisher=Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada}}</ref>

=== Reinforced concrete structures ===
[[File:StressedRibbonBridgeUnderside7138.JPG|thumb|2,048 × 1,536 px|left|Stressed Ribbon pedestrian bridge over the Rogue River, Grants Pass, [[Oregon]]]][[File:ThreeTwrBrCenter.jpg|thumb|800 x 600 px|left|Prestressed concrete [[cable-stayed bridge]] over [[Yangtze river]]]][[Reinforced concrete]] is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ([[rebars]]) or [[fiber]]s have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be [[brittle]]. It can be used to produce [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, floors or bridges.

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a kind of [[reinforced concrete]] used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to [[beams]], floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing [[tendon]]s (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.

To prevent catastrophic collapse in response earth shaking (in the interest of life safety), a traditional reinforced concrete frame should have [[ductile]] joints. Depending upon the methods used and the imposed seismic forces, such buildings may be immediately usable, require extensive repair, or may have to be demolished.

=== Prestressed structures ===
[[Prestressed structure]] is the one whose overall [[integrity]], [[Structural stability|stability]] and [[security]] depend, primarily, on a ''prestressing''. ''Prestressing'' means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.<ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign>{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|year=1987|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}</ref> [[File:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|1,600 x 1,200 px|right|Naturally pre-compressed exterior wall of [[Colosseum]], Rome]]

There are the following basic types of prestressing:
* Pre-compression (mostly, with the own weight of a structure)
* [[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons
* [[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons
Today, the concept of [[prestressed structure]] is widely engaged in design of [[building]]s, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, and numerous kinds of [[bridge]] systems.<ref name=PrestressedConcrete>{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|year=1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}</ref>

A beneficial idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; look, e.g., at the tall [[attic]] wall of [[Colosseum]] working as a stabilizing device for the wall [[pier]]s beneath.

=== Steel structures ===
[[File:LomaPrieta-BayBridge-collapsed-section.jpeg|thumb|340 × 512 px|right|Collapsed section of the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]] in response to [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]
'''Steel structures''' are considered mostly earthquake resistant but this isn't always the case. A great number of welded [[Steel Moment Resisting Frame]] buildings, which looked earthquake-proof, surprisingly experienced brittle behavior and were hazardously damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].<ref name=Reitherman>{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=394-395|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&productid=154097877}}</ref> After that, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) initiated development of repair techniques and new design approaches to minimize damage to steel moment frame buildings in future earthquakes.<ref>http://www.sacsteel.org/index.html</ref>

For [[structural steel]] seismic design based on [[Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) approach, it is very important to assess ability of a structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the [[inelastic]] range. A measure of this ability is [[ductility]], which may be observed in a ''material itself'', in a ''structural element'', or to a ''whole structure''.

As a consequence of [[Northridge earthquake]] experience, the American Institute of Steel Construction has introduced AISC 358 "Pre-Qualified Connections for Special and intermediate Steel Moment Frames."  The AISC Seismic Design Provisions require that all [[Steel Moment Resisting Frame]]s employ either connections contained in AISC 358, or the use of connections that have been subjected to pre-qualifying cyclic testing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Manual|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|location=Chicago|isbn=1-56424-056-8|pages=6.1-30}}</ref>

== Prediction of earthquake losses ==

'''Earthquake loss estimation''' is usually defined as a ''Damage Ratio'' ('''DR''') which is a ratio of the earthquake damage repair cost to the [[Total Economic Value|total value]] of a building.<ref name=SeismicRisk>{{cite book|title= Financial Management of Earthquake Risk|author=EERI Endowment Subcommittee|date=May 2000|publisher=EERI Publication|isbn=0-943198-21-6}}</ref>  ''Probable Maximum Loss'' ('''PML''') is a common term used for earthquake loss estimation, but it lacks a precise definition.  In 1999, ASTM E2026 'Standard Guide for the Estimation of Building Damageability in Earthquakes' was produced in order to standardize the nomenclature for seismic loss estimation, as well as establish guidelines as to the review process and qualifications of the reviewer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|year=1999|title=Loss Estimation|author=Eugene Trahern}}</ref>

Earthquake loss estimations are also referred to as ''Seismic Risk Assessments''.  The risk assessment process generally involves determining the probability of various ground motions coupled with the vulnerability or damage of the building under those ground motions.  The results are defined as a percent of building replacement value.<ref>{{cite book|title=Acceptable Risk Processes: Lifeline and Natural Hazards|year=2002|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784406236|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&productid=5260|editor=Craig Taylor and Erik VanMarcke}}</ref>

'''Seismic retrofitting''' is the modification of existing [[built environment|structures]] to make them more resistant to [[seismology|seismic activity]], ground motion, or [[soil]] failure due to [[earthquake]]s. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of [[built environment|modern seismic codes]] in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many other parts of the world (Turkey, China etc.),<ref name="Link1">[http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/10092/204/1/12605029_Main.pdf NZSEE Bulletin 39(2)-June 2006]</ref> many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world - such as the ASCE-SEI 41<ref name="Link2">[http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147485435 ASCE-SEI 41]</ref> and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)'s guidelines.<ref name="Link3">[http://www.nzsee.org.nz/PUBS/2006AISBEGUIDELINES_Corr_06a.pdf NZSEE 2006]</ref> These codes must be regularly updated; the [[1994 Northridge Earthquake]] brought to light the brittleness of welded steel frames, for example.<ref name=Reitherman>{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|year=2012|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=486–487|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&productid=154097877}}</ref> 

The [[retrofit]] techniques outlined here are also applicable for other natural hazards such as [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and severe [[wind]]s from [[thunderstorm]]s.  Whilst current practice of seismic retrofitting is predominantly concerned with structural improvements to reduce the seismic hazard of using the structures, it is similarly essential to reduce the hazards and losses from non-structural elements.  It is also important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure, although [[seismic performance]] can be greatly enhanced through proper initial design or subsequent modifications.

/==Strategies==/
Seismic retrofit (or rehabilitation) strategies have been developed in the past few decades following the introduction of new seismic provisions and the availability of advanced materials (e.g. [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP)]], [[Fiber-reinforced concrete|fiber reinforced concrete]] and high strength steel).<ref>[http://www.oonegroup.com/html/images/Articles/State%20of%20Research%20on%20Seismic%20Retrofit.pdf  Moehle, J. (2000) State of Research on Seismic Retrofit]</ref> Retrofit strategies are different from retrofit techniques, where the former is the basic approach to achieve an overall retrofit performance objective, such as increasing strength, increasing deformability, reducing deformation demands while the latter is the technical methods to achieve that strategy, for example [[Fibre-reinforced_plastic#Structural applications of FRP|FRP jacketing]]. 

*Increasing the global capacity (strengthening). This is typically done by the addition of cross braces or new structural walls.

*Reduction of the seismic demand by means of supplementary damping and/or use of [[base isolation]] systems.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/114025960/abstract Filiatrault & Cherry (1986)]</ref>

*Increasing the local capacity of structural elements. This strategy recognises the inherent capacity within the existing structures, and therefore adopt a more cost-effective approach to selectively upgrade local capacity (deformation/ductility, strength or stiffness) of individual structural components.

*Selective weakening retrofit. This is a counter intuitive strategy to change the inelastic mechanism of the structure, whilst recognising the inherent capacity of the structure.<ref>[http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/10092/1982/1/12611268_Kam.pdf e.g. Kam & Pampanin (2008)- Selective weakening retrofit for RC frames]</ref>

*Allowing sliding connections such as passageway bridges to accommodate additional movement between seismically independent structures.

/==Performance objectives==/
In the past, seismic retrofit was primarily applied to achieve public safety, with engineering solutions limited by economic and political considerations. However, with the development of [[Performance based earthquake engineering]] (PBEE), several levels of performance objectives are gradually recognised:

*Public safety only. The goal is to protect human life, ensuring that the structure will not collapse upon its occupants or passersby, and that the structure can be safely exited. Under severe seismic conditions the structure may be a total economic write-off, requiring tear-down and replacement.

*Structure survivability. The goal is that the structure, while remaining safe for exit, may require extensive repair (but not replacement) before it is generally useful or considered safe for occupation. This is typically the lowest level of retrofit applied to bridges.

*Structure functionality. Primary structure undamaged and the structure is undiminished in utility for its primary application. A high level of retrofit, this ensures that any required repairs are only "cosmetic" - for example, minor cracks in [[plaster]], [[drywall]] and [[stucco]]. This is the minimum acceptable level of retrofit for [[hospital]]s.

*Structure unaffected. This level of retrofit is preferred for historic structures of high cultural significance.

/==Techniques==/
Common seismic retrofitting techniques fall into several categories:

[[Image:Charlestonbolt.JPG|thumb|200px|right|One of many "earthquake bolts" found throughout period houses in the city of Charleston subsequent to the [[Charleston earthquake]] of 1886. They could be tightened and loosened to support the house without having to otherwise demolish the house due to instability. The bolts were directly loosely connected to the supporting frame of the house.]]

/===External post-tensioning===/
The use of external post-tensioning for new structural systems have been developed in the past decade. Under the PRESS (Precast Seismic Structural Systems),<ref>[http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build94/art069.html 1994 Building Publications - Status of the U.S. Precast Seismic Structural Systems (PRESSS) Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a large-scale U.S./Japan joint research program, unbonded post-tensioning high strength steel tendons have been used to achieve a moment-resisting system that has self-centering capacity. 
An extension of the same idea for seismic retrofitting has been experimentally tested for seismic retrofit of California bridges under a Caltrans research project <ref>[http://pubsindex.trb.org/view.aspx?id=505930 Lowes & Moehle (1998) - ACI Structural Journal  Vol 96(4) - pp 519-532]</ref> and for seismic retrofit of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames.<ref>Experimental testing of external post-tensioning for retrofit of RC beam-column joint [http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/10092/2745/1/12617958_Kam%20etal%20-%20selective%20weakening%20retrofit.pdf]</ref> Pre-stressing can increase the capacity of structural elements such as beam, column and beam-column joints. It should be noted that external pre-stressing has been used for structural upgrade for gravity/live loading since 1970s.<ref>[http://www.vsl.net/APPLICATIONSCASESTUDIES/BYSTRUCTUREMARKET/REPAIRSTRENGTHENING/tabid/115/Default.aspx VSL Repair/Strengthening Page]</ref>

/===Base isolators===/
''[[Base isolation]]'' is a collection of structural elements of a [[building]] that should substantially [[decouple]] the building's structure from the shaking ground thus protecting the building's integrity and enhancing its [[seismic performance]]. This [[earthquake engineering]] technology, which is a kind of seismic [[vibration control]], can be applied both to a newly designed building and to seismic upgrading of existing structures.<ref>[http://www.clarkconstruction.com/Portfolio/ViewPressRelease.asp?prid=155&Category=&CategoryName= Clark Construction Group, LLC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.siecorp.com/lfe/Projects/Seismic_Isolation/projects.html Projects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
Normally, excavations are made around the building and the building is separated from the foundations. Steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundations, while under these,  the isolating pads, or base isolators, replace the material removed. While the [[base isolation]] tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation. Careful attention to detail is required where the building interfaces with the ground, especially at entrances, stairways and ramps, to ensure sufficient relative motion of those structural elements.

/===Supplementary dampers===/
Supplementary dampers absorb the energy of motion and convert it to heat, thus "[[damping]]" resonant effects in structures that are rigidly attached to the ground. In addition to adding energy dissipation capacity to the structure, supplementary damping can reduce the displacement and acceleration demand within the structures. In some cases, the threat of damage does not come from the initial shock itself, but rather from the periodic [[resonance|resonant]] motion of the structure that repeated ground motion induces. In the practical sense, supplementary dampers act similarly to [[Shock absorber]]s used in [[suspension (vehicle)|automotive suspensions]].

/===Tuned mass dampers===/
[[Tuned mass dampers]] (TMD) employ movable weights on some sort of springs. These are typically employed to reduce wind sway in very tall, light buildings. Similar designs may be employed to impart earthquake resistance in eight to ten story buildings that are prone to destructive earthquake induced resonances.<ref>[http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211_fall2002.web.dir/Eva_Burk/Eva's%201st%20page.htm Slide 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

/===Slosh tank===/
A slosh tank is a large tank of fluid placed on an upper floor. During a seismic event, the fluid in this tank will slosh back and forth, but is directed by baffles - partitions that prevent the tank itself becoming resonant; through its mass the water may change or counter the resonant period of the building. Additional kinetic energy can be converted to heat by the baffles and is dissipated through the water - any temperature rise will be insignificant.

/===Active control system===/
Very tall buildings ("[[skyscrapers]]"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A solution to this problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic [[piston]]s, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion - with or without applied power - in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten [[floor|story]]) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.

/===Adhoc addition of structural support/reinforcement===/
The most common form of seismic retrofit to lower buildings is adding strength to the existing structure to resist seismic forces. The strengthening may be limited to connections between existing building elements or it may involve adding primary resisting elements such as walls or frames, particularly in the lower stories.

/====Connections between buildings and their expansion additions ====/
Frequently, building additions will not be strongly connected to the existing structure, but simply placed adjacent to it, with only minor continuity in flooring, siding, and roofing. As a result, the addition may have a different resonant period than the original structure, and they may easily detach from one another. The relative motion will then cause the two parts to collide, causing severe structural damage. Proper construction will tie the two building components rigidly together so that they behave as a single mass or employ dampers to expend the energy from relative motion, with appropriate allowance for this motion.

/==== Exterior reinforcement of building ====/

/====Exterior concrete columns====/
Historic buildings, made of unreinforced masonry, may have culturally important interior detailing or murals that should not be disturbed. In this case, the solution may be to add a number of steel, reinforced concrete, or poststressed concrete columns to the exterior. Careful attention must be paid to the connections with other members such as footings, top plates, and roof trusses.

/====Infill shear trusses====/
[[Image:ExteiorShearTruss.jpg|thumb|left|75px|&nbsp;]]
Shown here is an exterior shear reinforcement of a conventional reinforced concrete dormitory building. In this case, there was sufficient vertical strength in the building columns and sufficient shear strength in the lower stories that only limited shear reinforcement was required to make it earthquake resistant for this location near the [[Hayward Fault Zone|Hayward fault]].

/====Massive exterior structure====/
[[Image:ExteriorShearTrussTwo.jpg|thumb|right|&nbsp;]]
In other circumstances, far greater reinforcement is required. In the structure shown at right &mdash; a parking garage over shops &mdash; the placement, detailing, and painting of the reinforcement becomes itself an architectural embellishment.

/==Typical Retrofit Scenario & Solution==/

/===Soft-story failure===/

{{main|Soft story building}}
[[Image:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg|thumb|250px|Partial failure due to inadequate shear structure at garage level. Damage in [[San Francisco]] due to the [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]] event.]]
This collapse mode is known as ''soft story collapse''. In many buildings the ground level is designed for different uses than the upper levels. Low rise residential structures may be built over a parking garage which have large doors on one side. Hotels may have a tall ground floors to allow for a grand entrance or ballrooms. Office buildings may have stores in the ground floor which desire continuous windows for display. 

Traditional seismic design assumes that the lower stories of a building are stronger than the upper stories and where this is not the case—if the lower story is less strong than the upper structure—the structure will not respond to earthquakes in the expected fashion. Using modern design methods, it is possible to take a weak story into account. Several failures of this type in one large apartment complex caused most of the fatalities in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].

Typically, where this type of problem is found, the weak story is reinforced to make it stronger than the floors above by adding shear walls or moment frames. Moment frames consisting of inverted '''U''' bents are useful in preserving lower story garage access, while a lower cost solution may be to use shear walls or trusses in several locations, which partially reduce the usefulness for automobile parking but still allow the space to be used for other storage.

/===Beam-column joint connections===/
[[Image:SteelSeismicOverConcrete.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Corner joint steel reinforcement and high tensile strength rods with grouted anti-burst jacket below]]
Beam-column joint connections are a common structural weakness in dealing with seismic retrofitting. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in early 1970s, beam-column joints were typically non-engineered or designed. Laboratory testings have confirmed the seismic vulnerability of these poorly detailed and under-designed connections.<ref>Beres, A., Pessiki, S., White, R., and Gergely, P.

For reinforced concrete beam-column joints - various retrofit solutions have been proposed and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic retrofit strategies discussed above can be implemented for reinforced concrete joints. Concrete or steel jacketing have been a popular retrofit technique until the advent of composite materials such as [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer]] (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic retrofit with some success.<ref>Pampanin, S., Bolognini, D., Pavese, A.

Widespread weld failures at beam-column joints of low-to-medium rise steel buildings during the Northridge 1994 earthquake for example, have shown the structural defiencies of these 'modern-designed' post-1970s welded moment-resisting connections.<ref>Bertero VV, Anderson JC & Krawinkler H. Performance of steel building structures during the Northridge earthquake. Report No UCB/EERC-94/09. Berkeley, California: Earthquake Engineering Research Center, University of California at Berkeley. 1994.</ref> A subsequent SAC research project [http://www.sacsteel.org/] has documented, tested and proposed several retrofit solutions for these welded steel moment-resisting connections. Various retrofit solutions have been developed for these welded joints - such as a) weld strengthening and b) addition of steel haunch or 'dog-bone' shape flange.<ref>Civjan SA, Engelhardt MD and Gross JD (2000). Retrofit of pre-Northridge Moment Resisting Connections. ASCE J.o.Structural Engineering Vol 126(4) 445-452</ref>

Following the Northridge earthquake, a number of steel moment -frame buildings were found to have experienced brittle fractures of beam to column connections.  Discovery of these unanticipated brittle fractures of framing connections was alarming to engineers and the building industry.  Starting in the 1960s, engineers began to regard welded steel moment-frame buildings as being among the most ductile systems contained in the building code.  Many engineers believed that steel moment-frame buildings were essentially invulnerable to earthquake induced damage and thought that should damage occur, it would be limited to ductile yielding of members and connections.  Observation of damage sustained by buildings in the 1994 Northridge earthquake indicated that contrary to the intended behavior, in many cases, brittle fractures initiated within the connections at very low levels of plastic demand.  In September, 1994, The SAC joint Venture, AISC, AISI, and NIST jointly convened an international workshop in Los Angeles to coordinate the efforts of various participants and to lay the foundation for systematic investigation and resolution of the problem.  In September 1995 the SAC Joint Venture entered into a contractual agreement with FEMA to conduct Phase II of the SAC Steel project.  Under Phase II, SAC continued its extensive problem-focused study of the performance of moment resisting steel frames and connections of various configurations, with the ultimate goal of developing seismic design criteria for steel construction. As a result of these studies it is now known that the typical moment resiting connection detail employed in steel moment frame construction prior to the 1994 Northridge earthquake had a number of features that rendered it inherently susceptible to brittle fracture.<ref>FEMA 350, July 2000.  Recommended Seismic Design Criteria for New Steel Moment-Frame Buildings.1.3, pages 1-3 through 1-11.</ref>

/===Shear failure within floor diaphragm===/
Floors in wooden buildings are usually constructed upon relatively deep spans of wood, called [[joist]]s, covered with a diagonal wood planking or [[plywood]] to form a subfloor upon which the finish floor surface is laid. In many structures these are all aligned in the same direction. To prevent the beams from tipping over onto their side, blocking is used at each end, and for additional stiffness, blocking or diagonal wood or metal bracing may be placed between beams at one or more points in their spans. At the outer edge it is typical to use a single depth of blocking and a perimeter beam overall.

If the blocking or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the shear forces applied to the building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the [[sill plate]] of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, it may be necessary to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and [[bolted joint|bolts]] glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.

/===Sliding off foundation and "cripple wall" failure===/
[[Image:089srUSGSoffFoundation.jpg|thumb|250px|right|House slid off of foundation]]
[[Image:093srUSGSpinupFailure.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Low cripple wall collapse and detachment of structure from concrete stairway]]
Single or two story wood-frame domestic structures built on a perimeter or slab foundation are relatively safe in an earthquake, but in many structures built before 1950 the sill plate that sits between the concrete foundation and the floor diaphragm (perimeter foundation) or studwall (slab foundation) may not be sufficiently bolted in. Additionally, older attachments (without substantial corrosion-proofing) may have corroded to a point of weakness. A sideways shock can slide the building entirely off of the foundations or slab.

Often such buildings, especially if constructed on a moderate slope, are erected on a platform connected to a perimeter foundation through low stud-walls called "cripple wall" or ''pin-up''. This low wall structure itself may fail in shear or in its connections to itself at the corners, leading to the building moving diagonally and collapsing the low walls. The likelihood of failure of the pin-up can be reduced by ensuring that the corners are well reinforced in shear and that the shear panels are well connected to each other through the corner posts. This requires structural grade sheet plywood, often treated for rot resistance. This grade of plywood is made without interior unfilled knots and with more, thinner layers than common plywood. New buildings designed to resist earthquakes will typically use OSB ([[oriented strand board]]), sometimes with metal joins between panels, and with well attached [[stucco]] covering to enhance its performance. In many modern tract homes, especially those built upon expansive (clay) soil the building is constructed upon a single and relatively thick monolithic slab, kept in one piece by high tensile rods that are stressed after the slab has set. This poststressing places the concrete under compression - a condition under which it is extremely strong in bending and so will not crack under adverse soil conditions.

/===Multiple piers in shallow pits===/
Some older low-cost structures are elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This is seen in conditions of damp soil,  especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of [[permafrost]] (frozen mud) as it keeps the building's warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the floor panel at the corners of the building. Another technique is to add sufficient diagonal bracing or sections of concrete shear wall between pylons.

/===Reinforced concrete column burst===/
[[Image:BandedRetroColumn.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Jacketed and grouted column on left, unmodified on right]]
[[Reinforced concrete column]]s typically contain large diameter vertical [[rebar]] (reinforcing bars) arranged in a ring, surrounded by lighter-gauge hoops of rebar. Upon analysis of failures due to earthquakes, it has been realized that the weakness was not in the vertical bars, but rather in inadequate strength and quantity of hoops. Once the integrity of the hoops is breached, the vertical rebar can flex outward, stressing the central column of concrete. The concrete then simply crumbles into small pieces, now unconstrained by the surrounding rebar. In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used.

One simple retrofit is to surround the column with a jacket of steel plates formed and welded into a single cylinder. The space between the jacket and the column is then filled with concrete, a process called grouting. Where soil or structure conditions require such additional modification, additional pilings may be driven near the column base and concrete pads linking the pilings to the pylon are fabricated at or below ground level. In the example shown not all columns needed to be modified to gain sufficient seismic resistance for the conditions expected. (This location is about a mile from the [[Hayward Fault Zone]].)

/===Reinforced concrete wall burst===/
Concrete walls are often used at the transition between elevated road fill and overpass structures. The wall is used both to retain the soil and so enable the use of a shorter span and also to transfer the weight of the span directly downward to footings in undisturbed soil. If these walls are inadequate they may crumble under the stress of an earthquake's induced ground motion.

One form of retrofit is to drill numerous holes into the surface of the wall, and secure short '''L'''-shaped sections of rebar to the surface of each hole with [[epoxy]] [[adhesive]]. Additional vertical and horizontal rebar is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional footings in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and tie-backs to retain the span on the bounding walls.

/===Brick wall resin and glass fiber reinforcement===/
Brick building structures have been reinforced with coatings of glass fiber and appropriate resin (epoxy or polyester). In lower floors these may be applied over entire exposed surfaces, while in upper floors this may be confined to narrow areas around window and door openings. This application provides tensile strength that stiffens the wall against bending away from the side with the application. The efficient protection of an entire building requires extensive analysis and engineering to determine the appropriate locations to be treated.

/===Lift===/
Where moist or poorly consolidated [[alluvium|alluvial soil]] interfaces in a "beach like" structure against underlying firm material, seismic waves traveling through the alluvium can be amplified, just as are water waves against a sloping [[beach]]. In these special conditions, [[peak ground acceleration|vertical accelerations]] up to twice the force of gravity have been measured. If a building is not secured to a well-embedded foundation it is possible for the building to be thrust from (or with) its foundations into the air, usually with severe damage upon landing. Even if it is well-founded, higher portions such as upper stories or roof structures or attached structures such as canopies and porches may become detached from the primary structure.

Good practices in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate that there be good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, each of which is secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.

/===Soil===/
One of the most difficult retrofits is that required to prevent damage due to soil failure. Soil failure can occur on a slope, a [[slope failure]] or [[landslide]], or in a flat area due to [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] of water-saturated sand and/or mud. Generally, deep pilings must be driven into stable soil (typically hard mud or sand) or to underlying bedrock or the slope must be stabilized. For buildings built atop previous landslides the practicality of retrofit may be limited by economic factors, as it is not practical to stabilize a large, deep landslide. The likelihood of landslide or soil failure may also depend upon seasonal factors, as the soil may be more stable at the beginning of a wet season than at the beginning of the dry season. Such a "two season" ''[[Mediterranean climate]]'' is seen throughout [[California]].

In some cases, the best that can be done is to reduce the entrance of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both water-saturated and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving ''en masse'', carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to  monolithic concrete foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building will no longer be in its proper location.

/===Utility pipes and cables: risks===/
[[Natural gas]] and [[propane]] supply pipes to structures often prove especially dangerous during and after earthquakes. Should a building move from its foundation or fall due to cripple wall collapse, the ductile iron pipes transporting the gas within the structure may be broken, typically at the location of threaded joints. The gas may then still be provided to the pressure regulator from higher pressure lines and so continue to flow in substantial quantities; it may then be ignited by a nearby source such as a lit [[pilot light]] or [[spark gap|arc]]ing electrical connection.

There are two primary methods of automatically restraining the flow of gas after an earthquake, installed on the low pressure side of the regulator, and usually downstream of the gas meter.
*A caged metal ball may be arranged at the edge of an orifice. Upon seismic shock, the ball will roll into the orifice, sealing it to prevent gas flow. The ball may later be reset by the use of an external [[magnet]]. This device will respond only to ground motion.
*A flow-sensitive device may be used to close a valve if the flow of gas exceeds a set threshold (very much like an electrical [[circuit breaker]]). This device will operate independently of seismic motion, but will not respond to minor leaks which may be caused by an earthquake.

It appears that the most secure configuration would be to use one of each of these devices in series.

/===Tunnels===/
Unless the tunnel penetrates a fault likely to slip, the greatest danger to tunnels is a landslide blocking an entrance. Additional protection around the entrance may be applied to divert any falling material (similar as is done to divert snow [[avalanche]]s) or the slope above the tunnel may be stabilized in some way. Where only small- to medium-sized rocks and boulders are expected to fall, the entire slope may be covered with wire mesh, pinned down to the slope with metal rods. This is also a common modification to highway cuts where appropriate conditions exist.

/===Underwater tubes===/
The safety of underwater tubes is highly dependent upon the soil conditions through which the tunnel was constructed, the materials and reinforcements used, and the maximum predicted earthquake expected, and other factors, some of which may remain unknown under current knowledge.

/====BART tube====/
:''For current BART information concerning various seismic retrofits see [http://www.bart.gov/about/projects/eqs/updates.aspx].''
A tube of particular structural, seismic, economic, and political interest is the [[BART]] (Bay Area Rapid Transit) [[transbay tube]]. This tube was constructed at the bottom of [[San Francisco Bay]] through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) [[spaghetti]] in a bowl of [[gelatin dessert]]. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding [[slip joint]] was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]]. 

The engineers of the construction consortium PBTB (Parsons Brinckerhoff-Tudor-Bechtel) used the best estimates of ground motion available at the time, now known to be insufficient given modern computational analysis methods and geotechnical knowledge. Unexpected settlement of the tube has reduced the amount of slip that can be accommodated without failure. These factors have resulted in the slip joint being designed too short to ensure survival of the tube under possible (perhaps even likely) large earthquakes in the region. To correct this deficiency the slip joint must be extended to allow for additional movement, a modification expected to be both expensive and technically and logistically difficult. Other retrofits to the BART tube include vibratory consolidation of the tube's overfill to avoid potential liquefying of the overfill, which has now been completed. (Should the overfill fail there is a danger of portions of the tube rising from the bottom, an event which could potentially cause failure of the section connections.)

/==Bridge retrofit==/
[[Bridge]]s have several failure modes.

/===Expansion rockers===/
Many short bridge spans are statically anchored at one end and attached to rockers at the other. This rocker gives vertical and transverse support while allowing the bridge span to expand and contract with temperature changes. The change in the length of the span is accommodated over a gap in the roadway by comb-like [[expansion joint]]s. During severe ground motion, the rockers may jump from their tracks or be moved beyond their design limits, causing the bridge to unship from its resting point and then either become misaligned or fail completely. Motion can be constrained by adding ductile or high-strength steel restraints that are friction-clamped to beams and designed to slide under extreme stress while still limiting the motion relative to the anchorage.

/=== Deck rigidity ===/
[[Image:San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge Retrofit 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Additional diagonals were inserted under both decks of this bridge]]
[[Suspension bridge]]s may respond to earthquakes with a side-to-side motion exceeding that which was designed for wind gust response. Such motion can cause fragmentation of the road surface, damage to bearings, and plastic deformation or breakage of components. Devices such as hydraulic dampers or clamped sliding connections and additional diagonal reenforcement may be added.

/===Lattice girders, beams, and ties===/
[[Image:San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge Retrofit 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Obsolete riveted lattice members]]
[[Lattice girder]]s consist of two "I"-beams connected with a criss-cross lattice of flat strap or angle stock. These can be greatly strengthened by replacing the open lattice with plate members. This is usually done in concert with the replacement of hot [[rivet]]s with bolts.
[[Image:San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge Retrofit 2-cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Bolted plate lattice replacement, forming box members]]

/===Hot rivets===/
Many older structures were fabricated by inserting red-hot  rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer on one side and a bucking bar (an inertial mass) on the head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.

The solution is to burn out each rivet with an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxygen torch]]. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a [[reamer]]. A special ''locator bolt'', consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a [[wrench]]. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength [[alloy]] and has also been heat-treated,  it is not subject to either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.

/===Fill and overpass===/
Elevated roadways are typically built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns.If the soil fails where a bridge terminates, the bridge may become disconnected from the rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add additional reinforcement to any supporting wall, or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge.

Another failure occurs when the fill at each end moves (through resonant effects) in bulk, in opposite directions. If there is an insufficient founding shelf for the overpass, then it may fall. Additional shelf and ductile stays may be added to attach the overpass to the footings at one or both ends. The stays, rather than being fixed to the beams, may instead be clamped to them. Under moderate loading, these keep the overpass centered in the gap so that it is less likely to slide off its founding shelf at one end. The ability for the fixed ends to slide, rather than break, will prevent the complete drop of the structure if it should fail to remain on the footings.

/===Viaducts===/
Large sections of roadway may consist entirely of  viaduct, sections with no connection to the earth other than through vertical columns. When concrete columns are used, the detailing is critical. Typical failure may be in the toppling of a row of columns due either to soil connection failure or to insufficient cylindrical wrapping with rebar. Both failures were seen in the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] in [[Kobe, Japan]], where an entire viaduct, centrally supported by a single row of large columns, was laid down to one side. Such columns are reinforced by excavating to the foundation pad, driving additional pilings, and adding a new, larger pad, well connected with rebar alongside or into the column. A column with insufficient wrapping bar, which is prone to burst and then hinge at the bursting point, may be completely encased in a circular or elliptical jacket of welded steel sheet
and grouted as described above.

[[Image:022srUSGSCyprusVia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Cypress Freeway]] viaduct collapse. Note failure of inadequate anti-burst wrapping and lack of connection between upper and lower vertical elements.]]

Sometimes viaducts may fail in the connections between components. This was seen in the failure of the [[Cypress Freeway]] in [[Oakland, California]], during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]. This viaduct was a two-level structure, and the upper portions of the columns were not well connected to the lower portions that supported the lower level; this caused the upper deck to collapse upon the lower deck. Weak connections such as these require additional external jacketing - either through external steel components or by a complete jacket of reinforced concrete, often using stub connections that are glued (using [[epoxy]] adhesive) into numerous drilled holes. These stubs are then connected to additional wrappings, external forms (which may be temporary or permanent) are erected, and additional concrete is poured into the space. Large connected structures similar to the Cypress Viaduct must also be properly analyzed in their entirety using dynamic computer simulations.

/==Residential retrofit==/
Bolting of the mudsill to the foundation and application of plywood to cripple walls are a few basic retrofit techniques which homeowners may apply to wood-framed residential structures to mitigate the effects of seismic activity. The [[San Leandro, California|City of San Leandro]] created guidelines for these procedures, as outlined in the following [http://www.sanleandro.org/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=3440 pamphlet]. Public awareness and initiative are critical to the retrofit and preservation of existing building stock, and such efforts as those of the [[Association of Bay Area Governments]] are instrumental in providing [http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/fixit/fixit.html informational resources] to seismically active communities.

/===Wood frame structure===/
Predominantly residential/dwelling in North America consisted of wood-frame structure. Wood is one of the best materials for anti-seismic construction since it is of low mass and is relatively less brittle than masonry. It is easy to work with and very cheap compared to other modern material as steel and reinforced concrete. This is only resistant if the structure is properly connected to its foundation and has adequate shear resistance, in modern construction obtained by well connected surfacing of panels with [[plywood]] or oriented strand board in combination with exterior [[stucco]]. Steel strapping<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthquake-survival-kits.org/earthquake-straps.php |title=What are earthquake straps |publisher=earthquake-survival-kits.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref> and sheet forms are also used to connect elements securely.

Retrofit methods in older woodframe structures may consist of the following, and other methods not described here.
*The lowest plate rails of walls are bolted to a continuous foundation, or held down with rigid metal clips bolted to the foundation.
*Selected vertical elements, especially at wall junctures and window and door openings are attached securely to the sill plate.
*In two story buildings using "western" style construction (walls are progressively erected upon the lower story's upper diaphragm, unlike "eastern" ''balloon framing''), the upper walls are connected to the lower walls with tension elements. In some cases, connections may be extended vertically to include retention of certain roof elements.
*Low ''cripple walls'' are made shear resistant by adding plywood at the corners, and by securing corners from opening with metal strapping or fixtures.
*Vertical posts may be restrained from jumping off of their footings.

Wooden framing is efficient when combined with masonry, if the structure is properly designed. In Turkey, the traditional houses (bagdadi) are made with this technology. In [[El Salvador]], wood and bamboo are used for residential construction.

/===Reinforced and unreinforced masonry===/
In many parts of developing countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced or in some cases reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form in the early part of the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.

In the western United States, much of what is seen as masonry is actually brick or stone veneer. Current construction rules dictate the amount of ''tie&ndash;back'' required, which consist of metal straps secured to vertical structural elements. These straps extend into mortar courses, securing the veneer to the primary structure. Older structures may not secure this sufficiently for seismic safety. A weakly secured veneer in a house interior (sometimes used to face a fireplace from floor to ceiling) can be especially dangerous to occupants. Older masonry chimneys are also dangerous if they have substantial vertical extension above the roof. These are prone to breakage at the roofline and may fall into the house in a single large piece. For retrofit, additional supports may be added or it may be better to simply remove the extension and replace it with lighter materials, with special piping replacing the flue tile and a wood structure replacing the masonry. This may be matched against existing brickwork by using very thin veneer (similar to a tile, but with the appearance of a brick).
