== <font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">د نوم ريښه ==

<font face="Pashto Kror Asiatype">
د آذربايجان د نوم اصليت په اړوند ګڼ شمېر اټکلونه او فرضيې شته. خو په دغو کې تر ټولو عام اند دا دی چې دا نوم د آتروپاتان يا "Atropatan" نه راوتلی. آتروپات د پارس د امپراطورۍ په وختونو کې د همدې ځای والي وه. وروسته له دې چې مقدوني سکندر د آشمېندز د کورنۍ پاچاهي ړنګه کړه نو بيا دغې سيمې هم خپلواکي ترلاسه کړه. دا سيمه د منځنۍ آتروپاتيا يا آتروپاتېن په نوم هم نومول شوې.


There are also alternative opinions that the term is a slight Turkification of ''Azarbaijan'', in turn an Arabicized version of the original Persian name ''Âzarâbâdagân'', made up of ''âzar+âbadag+ân'' (''âzar''=fire; ''âbâdag''=cultivated area; ''ân''=suffix of pluralization); that it traditionally means "the land of eternal flames" or "the land of fire", which probably implies [[Zoroastrian]] fire temples in this land. Some Azeri historians contend that the name is made up of four [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] components: ''az+er+bay+can'', which means "the land of the brave Az people" or "an elevated place for the wealthy and exalted." <!--please name some of these Azeri historians who so contend-->

Historically, a large part of the territory of the present-day Azerbaijan Republic has been called [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]], named after Arran, a legendary founder of [[Caucasian Albania]]. However, the precise location identified by this name has shifted somewhat over time, currently referring to the lowland Karabakh plains situated between the [[Kura]] and [[Araks]] rivers.

Some opponents of the name ''Azerbaijan'' assert that it is anachronistic to use it in a historical context before 1918, because, they say, the term was first introduced by the national intelligentsia in early 20th century and later was endorsed by the Bolsheviks, with intention of claiming the northern province of [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. To substantiate this claim they state that until the early 20th century the population of present-day Azerbaijan had no clear ethnic identification and referred to themselves primarily as "Muslims."

== تاريخ==
''Main article: [[د آذربايجان تاريخ]]''

The earliest known inhabitants of what is today Azerbaijan were the [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, a [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]]-speaking people who appear to have been in the region prior to the host of peoples who would eventually invade the Caucasus. Historically Azerbaijan has been occupied by a variety of peoples, including [[Armenians]], [[Persians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Greek Empire]], and [[Russians]].

The first state to emerge in the territory of present-day Republic of Azerbaijan was [[Mannai|Mannae]] in the 9th century [[Anno Domini|BC]], lasting until 616 BC when it was overthrown by the [[Medes]]. The satrapies of Atropatene and [[Caucasian Albania]] were established in the [[4th century BC]] and included the approximate territories of present-day Azerbaijan and southern parts of [[Dagestan]].

[[Islam]] spread rapidly in Azerbaijan following the Arab conquests in the [[7th century|7th]]&ndash;[[8th century|8th centuries]]. After the power of the Arab Khalifate waned, several semi-independent states have been formed, the Shirvanshah kingdom being one of them. In the 11th century, the conquering [[Seljuk Turks]] became the dominant force in Azerbaijan and laid the ethnic foundation of contemporary [[Azerbaijanis]] or Azeri Turks. In the [[13th century|13]]&ndash;[[14th century|14th centuries]], the country experienced [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars|Tatar]] invasions.

Azerbaijan was part of the [[Safavids|Safavid state]] in [[15th century|15th]]&ndash;[[18th century|18th centuries]]. It also underwent a brief period of feudal fragmentation in the mid-18th to early 19th centuries, and consisted of independent khanates. Following the two wars between the [[Qajars|Qajar dynasty]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and the [[Russian Empire]], Azerbaijan was acquired by Russia through the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813, and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1828.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during [[World War I]], Azerbaijan declared independence and established the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. This first Muslim republic in the world lasted only two years, from 1918 to 1920, before the [[Soviet]] [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan. Subsequently, Azerbaijan became part of the [[Soviet Union]].

Azerbaijan re-established its independence upon the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite a [[cease-fire]] in place since 1994, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with [[Armenia]] over the predominantly ethnic Armenian [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. Azerbaijan has lost control of 16% of its territory including Karabakh, and must support some 800,000 [[refugee]]s and internally [[displaced person]]s as a result of the conflict.

== سياست==

[[Image:Ilham aliyev.jpg|right|160px|thumb|[[Ilham Aliyev]], President of Azerbaijan]]

Azerbaijan is a [[presidential republic]]. The [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] are separate from the country’s law-making body. The people elect the [[president of Azerbaijan|president]] for a five-year term of office. The president appoints all [[cabinet]]-level government administrators. A fifty-member national assembly makes the country’s laws. The people of Azerbaijan elect the [[National Assembly]]. Azerbaijan has [[universal suffrage]] above the age of eighteen.

After the presidential elections of [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|October 15, 2003]], an official release of the Central Election Committee (CEC) gave [[Isa Gambar]] — leader of the largest opposition bloc, [[Bizim Azerbaycan]] ("Our Azerbaijan") — 14% percent of the electorate and the second place in election. Third, with 3.6%, came [[Lala Shevket|Lala Shevket Hajiyeva]], leader of the National Unity Movement, the first woman to run in presidential election in Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and other international organizations, as well as local independent political and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s voiced concern about observed vote rigging and a badly flawed counting process.

Several independent local and international organizations that had been observing and monitoring the election directly or indirectly declared [[Isa Gambar]] winner in the [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|15 October election]]. Another view shared by many international organisations is that in reality a second tour of voting should have taken place between the two opposition candidates Isa Gambar and Lala Shevket.

*[[Human Rights Watch]] commented on [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|these elections]]: "Human Rights Watch research found that the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of Prime Minister Ilham Aliev, son of current President Heidar Aliev. The government has stacked the Central Election Commission and local election commission with its supporters, and banned local non-governmental organizations from monitoring the vote. As the elections draw nearer, government officials have openly sided with the campaign of Ilham Aliev, constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition events. In some cases, local officials have closed all the roads into town during opposition rallies, or have extended working and school hours—on one occasion, even declaring Sunday a workday—to prevent participation in opposition rallies."

''Main article: [[د آذربايجان جغرافيه]]''

پرته د سوېل ختيځو سيمو د آذربايجان نورې برخې وچ اقليم لري. د هوا تودوخه هم د کال د څپرکيو له مخې توپير لري. په زوړه زمکو کې چې د هېواد سوېل ختيځې خوا کې پرتې دي، منځوۍ تودوخه د 6°[[سلسيوز|C]] (43°[[فارېنهايټ|F]]) په ژمي کې او 26°C (80°F) په اوړي کې &mdash; که څه هم هره ورځ لوړه د نمونې په ډول رسېږي 32°C (89°F). په سهېلي او لوېديځو [[غرنيو سيمو]] کې , تودوخه منځوۍ 12°C (55°F) په اوړي کې او &ndash;9°C (20°F) په ژمي کې.

Annual rainfall over most of the country varies from 200 to 400 millimetres (8 to 16&nbsp;in) and is generally lowest in the northeast. In the far southeast, however, the climate is much moister and annual rainfall can be as high as 1300 [[millimetre]]s (51 [[inch|in]]). For most of the country, the wettest periods are in spring and autumn, with summers being the driest.

== اقتصاد==
''Main article: [[Economy of Azerbaijan]]''

The economy is largely based on [[industry]]. Industries include machine manufacture, [[petroleum]] and other [[mining]], petroleum [[refining]], [[textiles|textile]] production, and chemical processing. [[Agriculture]] accounts for one-third of Azerbaijan’s economy. Most of the nation’s farms are [[irrigation|irrigated]]. In the lowlands, farmers grow such crops as [[cotton]], [[fruit]], [[cereal|grain]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], and many types of [[vegetable]]s. [[Silkworm]]s are raised for the production of natural [[silk]] for the clothing industry. Azerbaijan’s herders raise [[cattle]], [[domestic sheep]] and [[goat]]s near the mountain ranges. [[Seafood]], including [[caviar]] and [[fish]] are caught in the nearby [[Caspian Sea]]. Azerbaijan has a highly dynamic economy, mainly because of oil, and has a GDP growth rate of up to 11% a year.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan has population of roughly 7,911,974 (July 2005 est.), 90.6% of whom are ethnic [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] (also called Azeris; 1999 census figures). Azeris also form about 24% of the population of [[Iran]], predominating in the northern regions of the country. Most of Armenia’s Azeri minority have left since independence and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] war. The second largest ethnic group are [[Russians]], who now form roughly 1.8% of the population, most having emigrated since independence.
The [[Talysh]], an Iranian people, predominate in the southernmost regions of the country around the Talysh mountains and across the border into Iran. Some people argue that the number of [[Talysh]] is greater than officially recorded, as many of them are counted as Azerbaijanis.
Numerous 'Dagestani' peoples live around the border with [[Dagestan]]. The main peoples are the [[Lezgis]], [[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] and the [[Tsakhur]]. Smaller groups include the [[Budukh]], [[Udi]], [[Kryts]] and [[Khinalug]]/Ketsh around the village of [[Xinaliq]]. Around the town of [[Quba]] in the north live the [[Tats]], also known as the [[Mountain Jews]], who are also to be found in Dagestan. Many Tats have emigrated to [[Israel]] in recent years, though this trend has slowed and even reversed more recently.
The country’s large Armenian population mostly fled to [[Armenia]] and to other countries with the beginning of the Armenian-Azeri conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. During the same period, Azerbaijan also received a large influx of Azerbaijanis fleeing Armenia and later [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and adjacent provinces occupied by the Armenians. Almost all of Azerbaijan’s Armenians now live in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Azerbaijan also contains numerous smaller groups, such as [[Kurds]], [[Georgians]], [[Tatars]] and [[Ukrainians]].

Most Azerbaijanis (about 60–70%) are [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslim]]. Other [[religion]]s or  beliefs that are followed by many in the country are the orthodox [[Sunni]] Islam, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] (in Karabakh), the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and various other Christian and Muslim sects. The Tat in [[Quba]], as well as several thousand [[Ashkenazim Jews]] in Baku, follow [[Judaism]]. Adherence to religious dogmas is nominal for the majority of the population and attitudes are secular. Traditionally, villages around Baku and the [[Lenkoran]] region are considered stronghold of Shi‘ism, and in some northern regions populated by Sunni Dagestani people, the Salafi sect has gained a following. Folk Islam is widely practiced, but an organized [[Sufi]] movement is absent.

== کلتور/فرهڼ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Azerbaijan]]''

The official language of Azerbaijan is [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], a member of the [[Oguz]] subdivision of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]], and is spoken by around 95% of the republic’s population, as well as about a third of the population of Iran. Its closest relatives in language are [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. As a result of the language policy of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russian language|Russian]] is also commonly spoken as a second language among the urbane. There are also speakers of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in the state. Azerbaijan’s culture has long cultural roots with [[Iran]] and [[Iranian peoples]].{{fact}}
