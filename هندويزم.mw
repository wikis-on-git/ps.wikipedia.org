'''Hinduism''' ([[Sanskrit]]/[[Hindi]]: '''{{lang|hi|हिन्दु धर्म}}'''; also known as ''Sanatana Dharma'' - {{lang|hi|सनातन् धर्म}}, and ''Vaidika Dharma'' - {{lang|hi|वैदिक धर्म}}) is a worldwide religious tradition that is based on the [[Veda|Vedas]], and is generally regarded as one of the oldest religions still practised in the world. The term Hinduism is an amorphous concept as Hinduism consists of several schools of thought. [[Hinduism]] evolved from a [[monolithic]] religion into a multitude of traditions over a period of last 4000 years. It encompasses many religious rituals that widely vary in practice, as well as many diverse sects and philosophies. An array of deities, all manifestations of the one Supreme [[monistic]] [[Brahman]], are venerated.  It is the third largest [[religion]] in the world, with a following of approximately 1 billion people. Ninety-eight percent of Hindus can be found on the [[Indian subcontinent]], chiefly in [[India]]. It is noteworthy however that the relatively small Himalayan kingdom of [[Nepal]] is the only nation in the world with Hinduism as its state religion.

The Hindu faiths, practices and philosophies have evolved from the '''Vedic tradition''' (''Vaidika parampar{{Unicode|ā}}''), with elements from Buddhism, Jainism and other non-Vedic faiths of India.

===ابدي لاره===
"''San{{Unicode|ā}}tana Dharma''" ({{Unicode|सनातन धर्म}}, ''The Eternal Values''), the traditional name of Hinduism, alludes to the idea that certain spiritual principles hold eternally true, transcending man-made constructs, representing a pure science of consciousness. This consciousness is not merely that of the body or mind and intellect, but of a transcendental state that exists within ''and'' beyond our somatic existence, the unsullied ''Soul'' of all. Religion to the Hindu is the eternal search for the divine ''[[Brahman]]'' ({{Unicode|ब्रह्मन्}}, pronounced as /{{IPA|brəhmən}}/, nominative singular: {{Unicode|ब्रह्म}} /{{IPA|brəhmə}}/), the ''Supreme Immanent and Transcendent Reality'' or the ''Cosmic Spirit''.

Hinduism's spiritual tradition as both monotheistic and tolerant is expressed in the ''Rig Vedic'' verse:
:{{Unicode| एकं सत् विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति ।}} RV 1:164:46 ''
:''{{Unicode| ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti}}''
:Truth is One, but sages call it by many names. 


Hinduism's aspiration is best expressed in the following ''[[mantra]]'':
:{{Unicode| ॐ । असतो मा सद्गमय । तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय । मृत्योर्मामृतं गमय ।।}}
:{{Unicode|'''OM''' ''Asato mā sadgamaya, tamaso mā jyotirgamaya, mrityormāmritam gamaya''}}
:"OM (Lead me) from falsehood to truth, from darkness to light, from death to immortality."

[[Image:Samsara.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hindus believe that every living being is an eternally existing spirit (the soul or the self). Upon physical death, this soul passes from one body to another in accordance with the laws of Karma and reincarnation. {{ref|re}}]]

=== بنسټيزې عقيدې ===
What can be said to be common to all Hindus is the belief in ''[[Dharma]]'' (individual ethics, duties and obligations), ''[[Samsara|{{Unicode|Samsāra}}]]'' ([[Reincarnation]]/rebirth), ''[[Karma]]'' ("actions", leading to a cause and effect relationship), and ''[[Moksha|{{Unicode|Mokṣha}}]]'' (salvation) of every soul through a variety of paths, such as ''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotion), ''[[Karma]]'' (selfless action) and ''[[Jnana|{{Unicode|Jñāna}}]]'' (enlightenment, knowledge), and of course, belief in God (''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|Īshvara}}]] / [[Bhagavan|{{Unicode|Bhagavān}}]]''). ''Reincarnation'' or the soul's transmigration through a cycle of birth and death, until it attains [[Moksha|{{Unicode|Mokṣha}}]], is governed by ''[[Karma]]''. The philosophy of ''Karma'' lays forth the results of free-willed actions, which leave their imprint on the [[soul]] or the self, called as ''[[Atman|{{Unicode|ātman}}]]''. These actions determine the course of life and the life cycle for the soul in its subsequent life. Virtuous actions take the soul closer to the Supreme Divine, and lead to a birth with higher consciousness. Evil actions hinder this recognition of the Supreme Divine, and the soul takes lower forms of worldly life. All existence, as per Hinduism, from vegetation to mankind, are subjects to the eternal ''Dharma'', which is the natural law. Even [[Heaven]] (''[[swarga|Svarga Loka]]'') and [[Hell]] (''[[Naraka|Naraka Loka]]'') are temporary. Liberation from this material existence and cycle of birth and death, to join, reach or develop a relationship with the "universal spirit" (depending on belief), is known as ''{{Unicode|Mokṣha}}'', which is the ultimate goal of all Hindus. 

The other principles include the ''[[Guru-shishya tradition]]'', the Divinity of Word of [[Aum|OM]] and the power of ''[[mantra]]s'', manifestations of the divine's spirit in all forms of existence ([[pantheism]]); that is an understanding that the essential spark of the ''[[Atman]]/[[Brahman]]'' is in every living being, the concept that all living beings are divine. Another interesting belief is that though the Hindu mythology mentions a class of evil beings (demons, called ''Asuras'' or ''{{Unicode|Rākṣhasas}}''), opposed to the celestial spirits (''Devas''), essential Hindu philosophy does not believe in any concept of a central [[Devil]] or [[Satan]]. This does not mean that all the evil in the world is attributed to God, but that the evil (deed or thought) is ascribed to human ignorance.

It is highly debatable whether a non-Hindu (by birth, as a foreigner) can become a Hindu or not. Hinduism certainly does not [[evangelization|evangelize]] as Christianity or Islam. Since the Hindu scriptures are essentially silent on this issue, it rather depends upon the Hindu society whether they might consider a foreigner, who has got a ''{{Unicode|dīkṣhā}}'' into a Hindu sect, as a Hindu or not.

===عمل (يوګا دهرما) ===
Hinduism includes a variety of practices, primarily spiritual devotion (''[[Bhakti Yoga]]''), selfless service (''[[Karma Yoga]]''), knowledge and meditation (''Jñāna'' or  ''[[Raja Yoga|{{Unicode|Rāja Yoga}}]]''). These are described in the two principal texts of Hindu [[Yoga]]: The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}]]'' and the ''[[Yoga Sutras|Yoga Sūtras]]''. The ''[[Upanishad]]s'' are also important as a philosophical foundation for these  practices.  The Yogas provide a sort of alternate path (or faiths) that links together various Hindu beliefs, and can also be used to categorize non-Hindu beliefs that are seen as paths to {{Unicode|moksha}}, or ''[[nirvana|{{Unicode|nirvāna}}]]''.

===د ژوندانه څلور هدفونه===    
Another major aspect of Hindu ''dharma'' that is common to practically all Hindus is that of the ''[[purusharthas|{{Unicode|puruṣhārthas}}]]'', the "four objectives of life". They are ''[[kama|{{Unicode|kāma}}]]'', ''[[artha]]'', ''[[dharma]]'' and ''[[moksha|{{Unicode|mokṣha}}]]''. It is said that all beings seek ''{{Unicode|kāma}}'' (pleasure, physical or emotional) and ''artha'' (material wealth), but soon, with maturity, learn to govern these legitimate desires within the higher framework of ''dharma'' (righteousness). Of course, the only goal that is truly ultimate, whose attainment results in ultimate happiness, is ''{{Unicode|mokṣha}}'' (salvation), also known as ''[[Mukti]]'' (spiritual liberation), ''[[Samadhi|{{Unicode|Samādhi}}]]'', ''[[Nirvana|{{Unicode|Nirvāṇa}}]]'', or escape from ''[[Samsara|{{Unicode|Samsāra}}]]'' (the cycle of births and deaths).

===د ژوندانه څلور پړاوونه===
Ideally (though not feasible for most of today's lay Hindus), the human life is divided into four ''[[Ashrama|{{Unicode|Āshrama}}]]s'' ("phases" or "stages"). They are ''[[Brahmacharya]]'', ''[[Grihastha|{{Unicode|Gṛihastha}}]]'', ''[[Vanaprastha|{{Unicode|Vānaprastha}}]]'' and ''[[Sanyasa|{{Unicode|Sanyāsa}}]]''. The first quarter of one's life, ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' ("meditation, or study of the ''Brahman''") is spent in [[celibate]], controlled, [[sober]] and pure contemplation under a [[Guru]], building up the mind for the realization of truth. ''[[Grihastha]]'' is the [[householder]]'s stage, alternatively known as ''[[samsara]]'', in which one marries and satisfies ''[[Kama (Hinduism)|{{Unicode|kāma}}]]'' and ''[[artha]]'' within one's married and ''[[professional]]'' life. ''[[Vanaprastha|{{Unicode|Vānaprastha}}]]'' is gradual detachment from the [[material world]], ostensibly giving over duties to one's children, spending more time in [[contemplation]] of the Divine, and making holy [[pilgrimage]]s. Finally, in ''[[sanyasa|{{Unicode|Sanyāsa}}]]'', the individual goes into seclusion, often envisioned as renunciation, to find the Divine through detachment from worldly life, and peacefully shed the body for the next life (or, for liberation).

Hindu society has traditionally been divided into four classes, based on profession—the '''''[[Brahmin|{{Unicode|Brāhmanas}}]]''''': teachers and priests; the '''''[[Kshatriya|{{Unicode|Kshatriyas}}]]''''': warriors, kings and administrators; the '''''[[Vaishya|{{Unicode|Vaishyas}}]]''''': farmers, merchants, herdsmen and businessmen; and the '''''[[Shudra|{{Unicode|Shūdras}}]]''''': servants and labourers. Each of these classes was called a '''''{{Unicode|varna}}''''', and the system was called '''''{{Unicode|Varna Vyavasthā}}'''''. It is highly debatable whether the ''{{Unicode|varna}}'' system is an integral part of Hinduism or not; and whether or not it is strictly sanctioned by the scriptures. The ''Shruti'' texts make very rare mentions of this system at some places, without defining things very much. The ''{{Unicode|Smriti}}'' texts (including the ''[[Manusmriti|{{Unicode|Manusmriti}}]]'') have elaborated the rules about this system. Earlier, the system was '''only''' based upon the profession (and character), and there are dozens of instances where people freely changed their professions and freely intermarried. Later, (the historians do not agree as to when) the system became fixed by '''birth'''. Thus, with the evolution of several sub-castes (along with a class of '''outcastes''' outside the ''{{Unicode|Varna Vyavasthā}}''), the system evolved into the [[caste]] system as we know of today. With modernization, caste differences are slowly fading away in modern India, but tension and prejudice still remain.
<!--ALTERNATIVE: Hindu society has traditionally been divided into four classes, based on moral character and spiritual purity through spiritual attainment — the '''Brahmanas''': priests and spiritual teachers/advisors; the '''Kshatriyas''': warriors who protect the Dharma, kings and administrators; the '''Vaishyas''': farmers, merchants, herdsmen and businessmen; and lastly the '''Shudras''' who were not initiated into Vedic learning: servants and labourers. Each of these classes was called a '''varna''', and the system was called '''Varna Vyavastha'''. The Varna system was an integral part of Hinduism and is related to spiritual attainment and duties based upon this spiritual attainment;  The Shruti texts such as the Vedas make mention of the "five classes of men". The Smriti texts (including the [[Manusmriti]]) have elaborated the rules about this system. Earlier, the system was '''only''' based upon the spiritual nature and purity of the person and their ability to participate in Vedic rituals.

=== د خدای طبيعت===
The Vedas depict ''[[Brahman]]'' as the Ultimate Reality, the Absolute or Universal Soul (''[[Paramatman|{{Unicode|Paramātman}}]]''). '''''Brahman''''' is the indescribable, inexhaustible, incorporeal, omniscient, omnipresent, original, first, eternal, both [[transcendent]] and [[immanent]], [[absolute infinite]] [[existence]], and the ultimate principle who is without a beginning, without an end, who is hidden in all and who is the cause, source, material and effect of all creation known, unknown and yet to happen in the entire universe. ''Brahman'' (not to be confused with the deity ''[[Brahma|{{Unicode|Brahmā}}]]'') is seen as a pantheistic '''Cosmic Spirit'''. The personality behind Brahman is known as ''Parabrahman'' (The superior ''Brahman''). ''Brahman'' may be viewed as without personal attributes (''[[Nirguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Nirguṇa Brahman}}]]'') or with attributes (''[[Saguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Saguṇa Brahman}}]]''). 

Perhaps the best word in Hinduism to represent the concept of '''God''' is '''''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|Īshvara}}]]''''' (lit. the '''Supreme Lord'''). In ''[[Advaita Vedanta|{{Unicode|Advaita Vedānta}}]]'' philosophy, ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'' is simply the manifested form of Brahman upon human mind. Thus, according to ''[[Smarta|{{Unicode|Smārta}}]]'' views, the Supreme Being can be with attributes, ''[[Saguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Saguṇa Brahman}}]]'', and also be viewed with whatever attributes, (e.g., a female goddess) a devotee conceives. For the Hindus, ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'', who is one and only one, is full of innumerable auspicious qualities; He is omniscient, omnipotent, perfect, just, merciful, glorious, mysterious, and yet full of love. He is the Creator, the Ruler and the Destroyer of this universe. Some believe Him to be infinite and incorporeal. In Vaishnavism and Shaivism, ''[[Saguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Saguṇa Brahman}}]]'' is viewed solely as [[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}]] or [[Shiva]]—so their followers may attribute an anthropomorphic form to {{Unicode|Īshvara}}. {{Unicode|Īshvara}} is also called as ''[[Bhagavan|{{Unicode|Bhagavān}}]]'' in modern Hindi. The divine power (or energy) of God is personified as female or ''[[Shakti]]''. However, the Divine and the divine energy are indivisible, unitary, and the same. The analogy is that fire represents the Divine and the actual heat ''[[Shakti]]''.

The Hindu religion also believes in several celestial entities which are called ''[[Deva (deity)|Devas]]''. These '''''Devas''''' may variously be translated into English as gods (which is rather a mistranslation), or better, as demigods, deities, celestial spirits or angels. The feminine of ''deva'' is '''''{{Unicode|devī}}'''''. It is these ''devas'' that give the western world a picture that Hinduism is [[polytheism|polytheistic]]. The question who or what these ''devas'' are may be analyzed under the following three points:

# According to the philosophy of ''[[Advaita Vedanta|{{Unicode|Advaita Vedānta}}]]'', and many verses of ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}]]'', the ''{{Unicode|Upaniṣhads}}'' and the ''Vedas'', all the ''devas'' are simply the more mundane manifestations of the Supreme Lord ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'' upon the human mind, and hence, ultimately, the different manifestations of the One ''Brahman'' that the human mind conceives. In order to worship the formless ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'', the devotee conceives an anthropomorphic form of God in his mind for the sake of worshipping Him with love and {{Unicode|Bhakti}}. A mention here could be made to one of the fundamental principles of Hinduism is depicted in the following words which have been widely accepted as true over numerous generations—''ekam sat {{Unicode|viprā bahudhā}} vadanti'' (''[[Rig Veda|{{Unicode|Ṛig Veda}}]]'' 1.164.46) meaning “The True God is '''one''', though the sages address him by multiple names”. Thus, most Hindus maintain that ''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|Īshvara}}]]'' is One and only One, although He can be viewed as having many manifestations such as ''{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}'' or  ''Shiva'' or the Mother Goddess—this view is especially true of the ''{{Unicode|Smārta}}'' denomination.
# According to the philosophies of ''[[Nyaya|{{Unicode|Nyāya}}]]'', ''[[Vaisheshika|{{Unicode|Vaisheṣhika}}]]'', ''[[Yoga]]'', certain verses from the ''Shrutis'' and certain Shaivite and Vaishnavite thoughts, the ''devas'' are those immortal celestial beings who are subservient to the Supreme Lord ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'', but are above human beings. Thus they are the [[angel]]s who preside over the forces of nature and act as a link between God and the mortal world. For instance, the Yoga philosophy says that ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'' is the father and ''[[guru]]'' of all the ''devas'' like ''{{Unicode|Prajāpati}}'' and ''Indra'', and of the ''[[rishi|{{Unicode|Ṛiṣhi}}]]s'' like ''[[Angiras|{{Unicode|Aṅgīras}}]]''. They all derive their power from God, under whose control they always work. Again note that the Vaishnavites and the Shaivites view Vishnu or Shiva respectively to be the same as ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}''. 
# According to the philosophy of ''[[Mimamsa|{{Unicode|Mīmāṃsā}}]]'', all the ''devas'' and ''{{Unicode|devīs}}'' are the sovereign rulers of the forces of nature and there is no one Supreme ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'' as their Lord. To do a desired action, the humans must please each or several of these ''devas'' by worshipping them with proper rituals. This kind of view could be regarded as purely [[polytheism|polytheistic]]. Although the later ''{{Unicode|Mīmāṃsakās}}'' had retracted from this view and accepted ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'', this view is still held today by a substancial populace of today's Hindus, especially the more illiterate and superstitious ones. 

The terms ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'' and ''devas'' must not be confused. ''Devas'' could be as numerous as [http://www.indhistory.com/hindu-god.html 330 million]. Thus, it is false to say that Hinduism has 330 million "Gods", which are more correctly ''[[devas]]'' or celestial beings; even the liberal ''[[Smarta|{{Unicode|Smārta}}]]'' denomination recognizes only six forms of God to be objects of worship; other denominations of Hinduism, such as [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] follows a singular concept of God, or [[panentheistic]] [[monotheism]]. More precisely, the Hindu scriptures and most Shaivite and Vaishnavite thoughts regard the ''devas'' as a combination of the first two views; e.g., ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|Kriṣhṇa}}]]'' is regarded as ''{{Unicode|Īshvara}}'' to whom all the demigods are subservient, and simultaneously, all the demigods are seen as mundane manifestations of {{Unicode|Kriṣhṇa}}. The third view is not supported by the scriptures.

Whatever it is, the ''devas'' (also called ''{{Unicode|devatās}}'') are an integral part of the colorful Hindu culture. The 33 early Vedic ''devas'' included ''[[Indra]]'', ''[[Agni]]'', ''[[Soma]]'', ''[[Varuna|{{Unicode|Varuṇa}}]]'', ''[[Mitra]]'', ''[[Savitri|{{Unicode|Savitṛ}}]]'', ''[[Rudra]]'', ''[[Prajapati|{{Unicode|Prajāpati}}]]'', ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}]]'', ''[[Aryaman]]'' and the ''[[Ashvin]]s''; important ''{{Unicode|devīs}}'' were ''[[Sarasvati|{{Unicode|Sarasvatī}}]]'', ''[[Ushas|{{Unicode|Ūṣhā}}]]'' and ''[[Prithvi|{{Unicode|Pṛithivī}}]]''. ''Indra'' is traditionally called the king of the demigods. The later {{Unicode|Purāṇas}} laud the Hindu Trinity of ''[[Brahma|{{Unicode|Brahmā}}]]'', ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}]]'' and ''[[Shiva]]'', i.e., ''[[Trimurti|{{Unicode|Trimūrti}}]]'', signifying respectively the creative, ruling and destroying aspects of the same One God. Note that ''{{Unicode|Brahmā}}'', ''{{Unicode|Viṣhnu}}'' and ''Shiva'' are not regarded as ordinary ''devas'' but as '''''{{Unicode|Mahādevas}}'''''. The ''{{Unicode|Purāṇas}}'' also laud other ''devas'' and ''[[avatar|{{Unicode|avatāras}}]]'' such as ''[[Ganesha|{{Unicode|Gaṇesha}}]]'', ''[[Hanuman|Hanumān]]'', ''[[Rama|{{Unicode|Rāma}}]]'', ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|Kriṣhṇa}}]]'', etc.  ''{{Unicode|Devīs}}'', worshipped as the mother, include ''[[Lakshmi|{{Unicode|Lakṣhmī}}]]'' and most importantly, ''[[Durga|{{Unicode|Durgā}}]]'' and her forms such as ''[[Kali|{{Unicode|Kālī}}]]''. Though all the different paths of salvation are, to various extents, acknowledged by all denominations, the actual conception of ''Brahman'' and its nature is what differentiates them. It is important to note that the contemporary perception of Hinduism, influenced by ''{{Unicode|Smārta}}'' traditions, depicts an ''inclusively monotheistic (or monistic)'' religion, which accordingly holds that the different deities are simply different manifestations of the One God.

== Denominations ==
{{main|Hindu denominations}}
Each of the Hinduism's four major denominations share [[rituals]], [[beliefs]], traditions and personal deities with one another, but each sect has a different philosophy on how to achieve life's ultimate goal (''[[Moksha|{{Unicode|Mokṣha}}]]'', salvation) and on their concept of God (''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|Īshvara}}]]''). However, each denomination respects all others, and conflict of any kind is rare. In fact, many Hindus will not claim to belong to any denomination at all. 

Contemporary Hinduism is now divided into four major divisions, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. The two primary form of differences are between the sects of [[Vaishnavism]] which conceives God as ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}]]'', and [[Shaivism]] which conceives God as ''[[Shiva]]''. Vaishnavas make up the majority of Hindus in India. [[Shaktism]] worships a female divine or goddess ''[[Devi|{{Unicode|Devī}}]]'' or alternatively (where it is viewed as a sub sect of Shaivism) as the power of ''Shiva'' personified. Smartism, in contrast, believes in all religions being the same and leading to a [[panentheism|pantheistic]] God. A number of reform movements have also given rise to sects like Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]]'s ''[[Arya Samaj|{{Unicode|Ārya Samāj}}]]'' which condemns [[iconolatry]], veneration of multiple deities and focuses on the ''Vedas'' and the Vedic fire-sacrifices (''[[yagna|yajña]]''). 

==== Vaishnavism ====
[[Image:Birlamandirdelhi.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The [[Birla Mandir]] is one of the most famous Vaishnavite temples in India.]]
{{main|Vaishnavism}}
A Vaishnavite considers '''''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}]]''''' (विष्णु) as the Supreme Being, and considers other deities as subordinate (as demigods). Accordingly, many Vaishnavites, for example, believe that ''{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}'' ultimately grants ''{{Unicode|mokṣha}}''. Vaishnavites consider worship of "other gods" as secondary due to ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|Kriṣhṇa}}]]''’s (who is a form of ''{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}'') sayings in the ''{{Unicode|Gītā}}'': 

'' Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, their wishes are granted by Me'' (''{{Unicode|Gītā}}'': 7:21-22)

'' O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship other subordinate deities (e.g., ''Devas'', for example) with faith, they also worship Me, [but] following non-injunction'' (''{{Unicode|Gītā}}'': 9:23).

==== Shaivism ====
{{main|Shaivism}}

Similar to Vaishnavism, many Shaivites hold that '''''[[Shiva]]''''' (शिव) is the Supreme Being and all other deities sprung forth from him. They follow either [[monistic]] or [[dvaita|dualistic]] philosophies.

==== Shaktism ====
{{main|Shaktism}}
''{{Unicode|Shāktas}}'' worship the Mother Goddess ''Shakti'' (or '''''[[Devi|{{Unicode|devī}}]]''''') in all of her forms, whilst not rejecting the importance of the masculine divinity. The "History of the ''{{Unicode|Shākta}}'' Religion" explains that ''The ''{{Unicode|Shāktas}}'' conceive their Great Goddess as the personification of primordial energy and the source of all divine and cosmic evolution. She is identified with the Supreme Being, conceived as the Source and the Spring as well as the Controller of all the forces and potentialities of Nature.'' It is associated with ''[[Vedanta|{{Unicode|Vedānta}}]]'', ''[[Samkhya|{{Unicode|Sāṃkhya}}]]'' and ''[[Tantra]]'' philosophies, is ultimately monist, and has a rich tradition of ''[[Bhakti yoga]]'' associated with it.

==== Smartism ====
{{main|Smartism}}
'''''{{Unicode|Smārtas}}''''' invariably follow ''Advaita'' (monist) philosophy, seeing multiple manifestations emanating from a single source called ''Brahman''.  It is seen as ultimate unity, with the personal "gods" (deities) being different manifestations of ''Brahman'' which can be called by different names. Smartism is the only branch of Hinduism that adopts these ideas strictly. The ''{{Unicode|Smārtas}}'' perspective dominates the view of Hinduism in the West because of the influence of eminent ''{{Unicode|Smārtins}}'' like Swami [[Vivekananda]].

== د هندوانو مقدسه ليکونه==
{{main|Hindu scripture}}
The overwhelming majority of Hindu [[scripture|sacred texts]] are composed in the [[Sanskrit language]]. Indeed, much of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[linguistic]] philosophy inherent in the learning of Sanskrit is sometimes claimed to be inextricably linked to study of the Vedas and relevant Hindu scriptures. 
===Shruti===
{{main|Shruti}}
The ''[[Veda]]s'' ({{Unicode|वेद}}, literally, "Knowledge") are considered as ''Shruti'' by the Hindus. They are said to have been revealed by the ''[[Brahman]]'' to the ''[[rishi|{{Unicode|Ṛiṣhi}}]]s'' while the latter were in deep meditation. While the overwhelming majority of Hindus may never read the ''[[Veda]]s'', there prevails in them a reverence for this transcendental notion of "Eternal Knowledge". The four ''[[Veda]]s'' (the ''[[Rig Veda|{{Unicode|Ṛig}}]], [[Yajur Veda|Yajur]], [[Sama Veda|{{Unicode|Sāma}}]] and [[Atharva Veda]]s'') are various ''{{Unicode|shākhās}}'' or branches of knowledge. Depending on the branch, different commentaries and instructions are associated with each Veda. The ''{{Unicode|Ṛig}} Veda'' contains mantras to invoke the ''devas'' for the fire-sacrifice rituals, the ''{{Unicode|Sāma}} Veda'' has chants to be sung there, the ''Yajur Veda'' has actual prosaic instructions for the sacrifices and the ''Atharva Veda'' comprises of semi-magical (sic) spells against enemies, sorcerers, diseases and mistakes during the sacrificing ritual. The Vedas, apart from the hymn (''[[mantra]]'') or the ''[[Samhita|{{Unicode|Saṃhitā}}]]'' (संहिता) portion, also have three layers of commentaries integrally incorporated within them. These are: the ''[[Brahmana|Brāhmaṇas]]'' (ब्राह्मण, not to be confused with ''Brahman'') containing prose commentaries on the rituals, the ''[[Aranyaka|{{Unicode|Āraṇyakas}}]]'' (आरण्यक) containing the mystical explanations of the mantras, and the ''[[Upanishad|{{Unicode|Upaniṣhads}}]]'' (उपनिषद्) containing highly philosophical and metaphysical writings about the nature of, and the relationship between the soul (''[[Atman|{{Unicode|ātman}}]]'') and the ''[[Brahman]]''. Each Veda also has various law books and ritual manuals loosely associated with it, like the ''[[Dharmashastra|{{Unicode|Dharmashāstra}}]]s'', ''{{Unicode|Grihyasūtras}}'', etc., but most people do not consider them as an integral part of the ''Shruti'' or the Vedic literature.

The ''{{Unicode|Upaniṣhads}}'' set Hindu philosophy apart with its embrace of transcendent and yet multiple immanent forces that is subjective to each individual, seen by some as an identification of unity in diversity. Modern indology suggests that while early Hinduism is most reliant on the four [[Veda]]s, Classical Hinduism, from the ''[[Yoga]]'' and ''[[Vedanta]]'' to ''[[Tantra]]'' and ''[[Bhakti]]'' streams, was moulded around the ''{{Unicode|Upaniṣhads}}''. The Vedas are full of mysticism and allegories. While many schools like Smartism and Advaitism encourage people to interpret the Vedas philosophically and metaphorically and not too literally, Vaishnavism stresses the literal meaning (''mukhya v{{Unicode|ṛ}}itti'') as primary and indirect meaning ({{Unicode|gauṇa vṛitti}}) as secondary: ''{{Unicode|sākṣhād upadesas tu shrutih}}'' - "The instructions of the shruti-sh{{Unicode|ā}}stra should be accepted literally, without so-called ''fanciful or allegorical interpretations''." (Jiva Gosvami, ''{{Unicode|Kṛiṣhna}} Sandarbha'' 29.26-27). The very sound of the Vedic mantras is considered as "purifying" by many Hindus, hence the rigour in learning pronunciation. The rigorous oral tradition of transmitting the Vedas has helped in its perfect preservation.

===Bhagavad Gita===
{{main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The '''''{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}''''' (भागवद् गीता), often referred to as the ''{{Unicode|Gītā}}'', is one of the more popular sacred texts of Hinduism. It is a summary of the [[Vedic religion|Vedic]], [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] and [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric]] branches of [[Hindu philosophy|philosophy]]. The ''{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}'', meaning "The Divine Song", refers to itself as a ''Yoga Upani{{Unicode|ṣ}}had'' and is sometimes called ''{{Unicode|Gītopaniṣad}}''. It expounds on ''[[Karma Yoga]]'', ''[[Bhakti Yoga]]'' and ''[[Jnana Yoga|{{Unicode|Jñāna}} Yoga]]''. It is an integral part of the epic ''[[Mahabharata|{{Unicode|Mahābhārata}}]]'', and contains philosophical sermons taught by ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|Kṛiṣhṇa}}]]'', an incarnation of ''{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}'', to the ''{{Unicode|Pāṇḍava}}'' princes just before a great war.

While technically, it is considered as ''[[Smriti|{{Unicode|Smṛiti}}]]'' text, it has singularly achieved the status of ''[[Shruti]]'', or ''Revealed Knowledge''. The ''{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}'' is described as the essence of the ''Vedas''. The ''{{Unicode|Gītā}}'' is easy to follow, and is also one of the most popular books in Hinduism. Unlike the ''Vedas'', which are more [[esoteric]] and intricate, the ''{{Unicode|Gītā}}'' is read by many practicing Hindus.

===Smriti===
{{main|Smriti}}
The other Hindu texts form the latter category—the '''''{{unicode|Smṛitis}}''''' (lit., "memory"), all of which laud the ''Vedas''; the most notable of them are the ''[[Mahabharata|{{Unicode|Mahābhārata}}]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana|{{Unicode|Rāmāyaṇa}}]]'', major [[epic poetry|epic]]s considered sacred by almost all followers of ''San{{Unicode|ā}}tana Dharma''. Their stories are arguably familiar to the vast majority of Hindus. Other texts considered important by today's Hindus include the ''{{Unicode|Shrīmad Bhāgavatam}}'', described as the spotless epic detailing devotion to ''{{Unicode|Viṣhnu}}'' as the highest goal, ''[[Devi Mahatmya|{{Unicode|Devī Mahātmya}}]]'', an ode to ''[[Devi|{{Unicode|Devī}}]]'', and the ''[[Yoga Sutras|{{Unicode|Yoga Sūtras}}]]'', a key meditative yoga text of ''Shri [[Patanjali|{{Unicode|Patañjali}}]]''. There are also a number of revered Hindu ''[[Tantras]]'', the ''[[Manusmriti|{{unicode|Manusmṛiti}}]]'', the 18 ''[[Purana|{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}]]s'' which vividly describe later Hinduism's deities and mythology, and [[List of sutras|{{Unicode|Sūtras}}]] that command the respect of various Hindu sects of different persuasion, some including the ''{{Unicode|Mahanirvāṇa Tantra}}'', ''[[Tirumantiram]]'' and ''[[Shiva Sutras|{{Unicode|Shiva Sūtras}}]]''. The eighteen ''[[Purana|{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}]]s'', or ''Ancients'', are divided into three groups of six. The ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}s’'' groups and their contents are: 1) the ''{{Unicode|Brahmā Purāṇa}}s'': ''{{Unicode|Brahma Purāṇa}}'', ''{{Unicode|Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa}}'', ''Brahma Vaivarta'' ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}'', ''{{Unicode|Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa}}'',  ''{{Unicode|Bhaviṣhya Purāṇa}}'', and the ''{{Unicode|Vāmana Purāṇa}}''; 2) the ''{{Unicode|Viṣhnu Purāṇa}}s'': the ''{{Unicode|Viṣhnu Purāṇa}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Bhāgavata Purāṇa}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Nāradeya Purāṇa}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Garuḍa Purāṇa}}'', the  ''Padma'' ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}'', and the ''{{Unicode|Varāha Purāṇa}}''; and 3) the ''Shiva'' ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}s'': the ''{{Unicode|Vāyu Purāṇa}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Liṅga Purāṇa}}'', the ''Skanda {{Unicode|Purāṇa}}'' , the ''Agni'' ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}'', the ''Matsya'' ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}'', and the ''Karma'' ''{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}''. The ''{{Unicode|Rāmāyaṇa}}'', ''{{Unicode|Mahābhārata}}'' and many ''{{Unicode|Purāṇas}}'' are much more widely read by today's Hindus than the ''Vedas'', and the temple and icon worship of modern Hinduism is attributable to them. It is interesting to note that the Hindus attach much more importance to the ethics and the metaphorical meanings conveyed by these texts, rather than only the literal mythology. Other important scriptures are the sectarian ''[[Hindu Agamas|Hindu {{Unicode|Āgamas}}]]'' which are texts related to rituals and worship and is dedicated to ''{{Unicode|Viṣhnu}}'', ''Shiva'' and ''{{Unicode|Devī}}''. The ''Shruti'' takes precedence over the ''{{unicode|Smṛiti}}'' in any matter of apparent mutual dispute. However, many Vaishnavites regard the ''{{Unicode|Purāṇas}}'' to be as authoritative as the ''Vedas''.

== Origins and society ==

===Origins of Hinduism ===
{{main|History of Hinduism}}
[[Image:Wheel of Konark, Orissa, India.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Sun Temple]] in [[Konark]], [[Orissa]] is one of the most famous stone [[monument]] in the world. The temple is conceived as a massive 24-wheel chariot of the Sun God [[Surya]].]]
Hinduism is one of the world's oldest major religions in existence. From a Hindu perspective, the [[Sanatana Dharma]] propounds eternal and universal principles with no beginning or end. The [[Purana]]s place Lord Krishna's birth at around 3100 BCE. Krishna's incarnation was preceded by Lord [[Rama]]'s, sometimes dated at over 5-6000 BCE, or even more than a million years ago in the [[Treta Yuga]] according to the Ramayana Epic. Many Hindus believe that their religious tradition was fully formed by the time of Lord [[Rama]], the seventh incarnation of Lord [[Vishnu]]. Modern [[Indology]] dates the roots of Hinduism to about 1500-1300 BCE, based on [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and literary dating of the Rig Veda. This dating is rejected by most Hindus, who reject the validity of the [[Indo-Aryan migration]] hypothesis.

The origin of collective Hindu thought cannot be ascribed to any single founder (though most of its later schools of philosophy and belief can be), or associated with a specific time or a single place of foundation. The Vedas, the earliest Hindu scriptures, are the compilation of spiritual laws and truths binding upon all of creation. It is believed that each Veda was revealed to enlightened sages, called [[Rishi]]s, over a long period of time. Lord Vishnu is believed to have transmitted the Vedas to Lord Brahma via meditative trance at the beginning of each creation.

Hinduism, along with [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], is regarded to be an ''[[Arya]] [[Dharma]]'', meaning, a noble religion.

=== Etymology ===
Though linguists and historians haven't reached a consensus, the term [[Hindu]] is generally accepted to be derived from the name of the [[Sindhu]] (सिन्धु, i.e., the [[Indus]]) river, which is known as '''Hindu''' in Persian. The term was used for people that lived around or beyond the Sindhu. In this region, the advanced [[Mohenjo-daro]] civilization flourished about five thousand years ago. Hinduism, in some form, probably existed long before that. In the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] linguistic branch, the /s/ of the [[Indic]] branch (as represented by Sanskrit) is cognate with the /h/ sound of Iranian (as represented by Avestan and Old Persian). In the Rig Veda, the Indo-Aryans mention their expanse as '''sapta sindhu''' (the land of seven rivers). This became the term '''Hapta-Hindu''' in [[Avesta]] (Vendidad: Fargard 1.18). Hindu (In-du or In-tu in [[China]]) is still used in some languages to denote an Indian or India. The [[Greek language|Greek]] term "India" was originally pronounced Hindia; /h/ became lost as in later Greek there was no character for "h". In modern Persian and Arabic, the term '''Hindustan''' denotes the Indian subcontinent, and '''Hind''' or '''Al-Hind''' is used to denote the Republic of India.

The word '''Hindu''' (हिन्दु), possibly due to Iranian influence, in the sense of people of India, is used in some early-medieval Sanskrit texts like BhaviShya Purana, Kalika Purana, Merutantra, Ramakosha, Hemantakavikosha and Adbhutarupakosha. India is also traditionally, but unofficially called [[Hindustan]] or [[Hind]] in [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. Note that the word [[Hindustan]] also has other meanings.

Until about 19th century the term Hindu implied a culture and ethnicity and not a religion. When the British government started periodic censuses and established a legal system, the need arose to define [[Hinduism]] as a distinct religion, along the lines of [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]]. Some scholars, such as [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], defined it as a religion based on the [[Vedas]], using the analogy of the [[Bible]] being the basis of Christianity and the [[Qur'an]] being the Muslim scripture.

That even an [[atheism|atheist]] may be called a Hindu is an example of the fact that Hinduism is far more than a simple religious system; it is actually an extremely diverse and complicated river of evolving [[philosophy|philosophies]] and ancient [[tradition]]s.

===Vedic religion===
{{main|Vedic religion}}
Modern Hinduism grew out of the knowledge described in the [[Vedas]]. The earliest of these, the [[Rigveda]] centers on worship of the deities [[Indra]] and [[Agni]], and on the [[Soma]] ritual. They would perform fire-sacrifices called [[yagna|yajña]] (यज्ञ) with the chanting of the Vedic mantras, but they built no temples, idols or icons. Probably animals were also sacrificed in larger yajñas, as claimed by Buddhist and Jain texts. The [[Ashvamedha]] was the most important sacrifice described in the [[Yajurveda]], possibly performed for the last time by [[Samudragupta]] in the [[4th century]]. The age and origins of the Vedas themselves are disputed, but it is clear that they were transmitted orally for several millennia. They show strong similarities to the language and religion of the [[Avesta]], as well as more distantly to other [[Indo-European languages]] and religions (see [[Indo-Aryan migration]]).

===Hindu nationalism===
{{main articles|[[Hindu Nationalism]], [[Hindutva]], and [[Hindu Rashtra]]}}

In the 20th century, emerging Indian [[nationalism]] began to emphasize Hinduism, in opposition to the British Raj, but also in contrast to [[Islam]], and after Independence in connection with the territorial disputes with Pakistan. Such nationalistic Hinduism is generally termed [[Hindutva]] ("Hinduness", paradoxically not a well-formed Sanskrit word, since "Hindu" is a Persian word), but the boundaries are fluid and the Indian Supreme Court ruled that "no precise meaning can be ascribed to the terms 'Hindu', 'Hindutva' and 'Hinduism'; and no meaning in the abstract can confine it to the narrow limits of religion alone, excluding the content of Indian culture and heritage." Hindutva ideology was enunciated first by [[Savarkar]] in his seminal work 'Hindutva'. Hindutva ideology rose to importance in [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the [[1980s]] and is chiefly associated with the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] movement. It has come to symbolize the rising bi-polarization of Indian polity in the late 1990's and the first decade of the 21st century, evident in the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) in the same period. One of their short term aims is to build a temple to Rama at the site of the controversial [[Babri]] [[mosque]] (destroyed by some Hindutva activists in 1992) in [[Ayodhya]]. Many believe that Lord Rama was born at the site, and that a Vaishnavite temple was constructed there to commemorate the birthplace. Some historians and Hindutva activists claim that the [[Mughal]] commander [[Mir Baki]] destroyed the temple and built the Babri mosque, in his alleged frenzy of [[iconoclasm]]. However, the destruction of the temple is also attributed to the [[Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]].

{{main|Mandir}}
[[Image:Temple4.jpg|thumb|295px|left|The world's first [http://www.swaminarayan.info/mandirs/kalupur/ Swaminarayan Temple]was built in [[Ahmedabad]] by the instructions of [[Bhagwan Swaminarayan]].]]
[[Image:Gopuram-madurai.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Most of the Hindu temples have their principal shrine facing the rising sun and their entrance facing east. An important aspect of the temple design is that it is intended to lead from the temporal world to the eternal one. Shown here, is the [[Meenakshi temple]] in Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India.]]
Hindu temples inherited rich and ancient rituals and customs, and have occupied a special place in Hindu society. They are usually dedicated to a primary deity, called the presiding deity, and other subordinate deities associated with the main deity. However, some ''mandirs'' are dedicated to multiple deities. Most major temples are constructed as per the [[agama|agama shastras]] and many are sites of pilgrimage. For many Hindus, the four '''Shankaracharyas''' (the abbots of the monasteries of [[Jyotirmath|Joshimath]], [[Govardhana matha|Puri]], [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|Sringeri]] and [[Dwaraka Pītha|Dwarka]] — four of the holiest pilgrimage centers — sometimes to which a fifth at [[Kanchi matha|Kanchi]] is also added) are viewed as the four highest [[Patriarch]]s of the Hindudom.

Temples are a place for darshan (vision of the divine), [[puja]], [[meditation]], and religious congregation (though not so regular and often as among the Muslims and the Christians) among other religious activities. [[Puja]] or worship, frequently uses the aid of a ''[[#Forms of worship: icons and mantras|murti]]'' (statue in which divine presence is invoked) in conjunction with the singing or chanting of meditational prayer in the form of [[mantra]]s. Devotional songs called [[bhajan]]s (written primarily from the 14th-17th centuries), [[kirtan]] (devotional songs), and [[arti]] are sometimes sung in conjunction with performance of puja. This rather organic system of devotion attempts to aid the individual in connecting with God through symbolic communion. This form of icon and temple worship, [[puja]], is integral to the [[Bhakti]] cult.

Most Hindu homes also have a specific area devoted to daily worship of the deities with religious icons and meditation.

Of the total Hindu population of the world, about 94% (890 million) live in [[India]]. Significant numbers of Hindus reside in [[Bali]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Fiji]], [[Guyana]], [[Nepal]], [[Mauritius]], [[Suriname]], [[Singapore]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. In [[Nepal]] and [[Bali]], Hinduism is the major religion, and is still reflected in the traditional culture and architecture. There are also sizeable Hindu populations in [[Sri Lanka]] (3 million), [[Pakistan]] (2.5 million),  [[Malaysia]] (1.5 million), [[United States]] (1.5 million), [[South Africa]] (1.1 million) the [[Middle East]] (1 million) and the [[United Kingdom]] (1 million).

==Hindu philosophy: the six Vedic schools of thought==
{{main|Hindu philosophy}}
The six ''Astika'' or orthodox (accepting the authority of the Vedas) schools of Hindu philosophy are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Purva Mimamsa]] (also called just 'Mimamsa'), and [[Vedanta|Uttara Mimamsa]] (also called '[[Vedanta]]'). The non-Vedic schools are called Nastika, or heterodox, and refer to [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Lokayata]]. The schools that continue to enrich Hinduism today are [[Purva Mimamsa]], [[Yoga]], and [[Vedanta]]. See [[Hindu philosophy]] for a discussion of the historical significance of [[Samkhya]], [[Nyaya]], and [[Vaisheshika]].

===Purva Mimamsa===
{{main|Purva Mimamsa}}
The main objective of Purva ("earlier") [[Mimamsa]] school (also simply called '''Mimamsa''') was to firmly establish the authority of the Vedas. Consequently, this school's most valuable contribution to Hinduism was its formulation of the rules of interpretation of Vedas. Its adherents believed that true knowledge is self-evidently proven, and tried to find out the basis of the Vedic ritualism through reasoning. This school of thought forms the basis of Modern Hindu ritualism (strictly followed only by a minority), which believes in the inherent power of rituals.

===يوګا===
{{main|Yoga}}
[[Image:Indus 03.jpg|thumb|200px|right|In Hinduism, Yoga is considered to be the ultimate way of attaining spiritual goals. The earliest written accounts of yoga appear in the [[Rig Veda]], which began to be codified between 1500 and 1200 BCE. Some historians believe that this 5000 thousand years old sculpture is of a yogi.]]
Yoga means ''union'' and is generally interpreted as union with the Divine, or integration of body, mind, and spirit. Its goals are [[moksha]] or [[samadhi]]. It, like the [[Upanishad]]s, seeks liberation through the disunion of the spirit ([[Purusha]]) and the nature ([[Prakriti]]), through meditational, physical and spiritual practices, along with a firm belief in God ([[Ishvara]]).

[[Upanishads]], sage [[Patanjali]]'s [[Yoga Sutra]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]] are indispensable literature in the study of Yoga and elaborate on [[Raja Yoga]], [[Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma Yoga]] and [[Gyana Yoga]]. Of these, the [[Yoga Sutra]] is essentially a compilation and systematization of meditational Yoga philosophy.

===Uttara Mimamsa: Vedanta and its three main schools===
{{main|Vedanta}}
The Uttara ("later") Mimamsa school, also called as [[Vedanta]], is the central pillar of Hinduism and was responsible for a new wave of philosophical and meditative enquiry, renewal and revival of Hinduism, and established strong philosophical foundation. Primarily associated with the [[Upanishad]]s and their commentaries by [[Badarayana]] — the [[Vedanta Sutra]]s, Vedanta thought, according to the pre-Shankaran Buddhist sources (Aryadeva, Kamalashila, Bhavya) monotheistic, later split into three principal (and three other) groups, initiated by the thinking and writing of [[Adi Sankara]]. Most Hindu thought today in some way relates to changes affected by [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] thought, which focused on unity of the whole God.
The great debate between followers the major Hindu philosophical school, [[Advaita]] and the schools such as those of [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhva]], focused on the true nature of [[Brahman]], on whether Brahman was essentially monistic, qualified non-dualistic or dualistic in nature. The world famous sect of [[ISKCON]], worshipping [[Krishna]], follows the Vedantic philosophy of '''Acintya Bhedabheda''' by [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].

====Pure monism: [[Advaita Vedanta]]====
{{main|Advaita}}
''Advaita'' literally means "not two"; thus this is what we refer to as a monistic (or non-dualistic) philosophy, which emphasizes the oneness of the Divine. Its proponent was [[Adi Sankara]] ([[788]]?-[[820]]?). Sankara expounded his theories largely based on previous teachings of the [[Upanishad]]s and his own [[guru]] [[Govinda Bhagavadpada]]. By the analysis of Vedas, he proposed the relative nature of the Universe and established the non-dual nature of Brahman in which [[Atman]] (the individual soul) and [[Brahman]] (the Ultimate Reality) are identified to be identical. Reality is categorised into three levels: '''Transcendental''', '''Pragmatic''' and '''Apparent'''. As compared to the Brahman which is the Supreme Reality, everything else, including the universe, the individuals and even Ishvara are not true. The universe, the individuals and Ishvara are true only in the Pragmatic level.

To Advaitists (nondualists) Ultimate Reality is best expressed as [[Nirguna Brahman]], or God without form, or God without physical attributes; indeed, some might go so far as to say it is not 'God' but something beyond - the Godhead. However, even that definition can be limiting. Nirguna Brahman can never be described as that as It transcends all definitions. All personal forms of God ([[Ishvara]]) such as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] or the Mother Goddess are different aspects of Nirguna Brahman in physical form, or God with attributes, [[Saguna Brahman]]. In fact, when a being tries to know the '''Supreme Spirit''' (Brahman) through his mind, Brahman becomes the '''Supreme Lord''' (Ishvara), under the effect of an illusionary power of Brahman called [[Maya (Hinduism)|Maya]]. The material universe and the appearance of the single Atman to be seen as innumerable individual souls are also because of Maya. True knowledge of the Brahman ('''Jñana''') is the only way to liberation; however, good Karma and Bhakti are recognized as great help in attaining true knowledge. Adi Sankara had also condemned the caste system.

====Qualified monism: [[Vishistadvaita]] [[Bhakti]]====
{{main|Vishistadvaita}}
[[Ramanuja]] ([[1040]] - [[1137]]) was the foremost proponent of the concept of Sriman '''Narayana''' as the supreme Brahman. He taught that Ultimate Reality had three aspects: '''Ishvara''' ([[Vishnu]]), chit (soul) and achit (matter). Vishnu is the only independent reality, while souls and matter are dependent on God Vishnu for their existence. Because of this qualification of Ultimate reality, Ramanuja's system is known as qualified non-dualism. [[Karma]] along with [[Bhakti]] for is the true path for liberation.

====Dualism: [[Dvaita]] [[Bhakti]] ====
{{main|Dvaita}}
Like Ramanuja, [[Shri Madhvacharya|Madhva]] ([[1238]] - [[1317]]) identified [[God]] with Vishnu, but his view of reality was purely dualistic in that he understood a fundamental differentiation between the ultimate Godhead and the individual soul, and the system is therefore called Dvaita (dualistic) Vedanta. [[Bhakti]] is the only way for liberation.

==Alternative cultures of worship==

===The Bhakti schools===
{{main|Bhakti}}

The [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti]] (Devotional) school takes its name from the Hindu term that signifies a blissful, selfless and overwhelming devotion of God as the beloved Father, Mother, Child, or whatever relationship finds appeal in the devotee's heart. The philosophy of Bhakti seeks to relate to the personal form of God. Seen as a form of [[Yoga]], or union, it seeks to interlink the self with God, since consciousness of the body and limited mind as self is seen to be a limiting factor in spiritual realization. 
Essentially, it is God who effects all change, who is the source of all works, who acts through the devotee as love and light. 'Sins' and evil-doings of the devotee are said to fall away of their own accord, the devotee shriven, limitedness even transcended, through the devotion of God. The [[Bhakti]] movements rejuvenated Hinduism through their intense expression of devotion and their responsiveness to the emotional and philosophical needs of India. 

Altogether, bhakti resulted in a mass of devotional literature, music and art that has enriched the world and given India renewed spiritual impetus, one eschewing elaborate rituals.

===Tantra===
{{main|Tantra}}
Tantra is one of the least understood areas of Hinduism — often perceived as free sex associated with religion. A tantra literally means an act. A mantra is a hymn or sacred words associated with a deity. A mantra is associated with an Yantra, which is a mystical diagram. All acts of worship which include Mantras, Yantras are called Tantras.

Tantras can be divided into two paths - The right hand path (also known as samayachara or Dakshinachara) and the Left hand path (Vamachara).

Extolled as a short-cut to self-realization and spiritual enlightenment by some, left-hand tantric rites are often rejected as dangerous by most orthodox Hindus. 

:''For the benefit of men of the Kali age, men bereft of energy and dependent for existence on the food they eat, the Kaula doctrine, O auspicious one! is given'', said Shiva on the Kaula school of Tantrism.

The word "[[tantra]]" also means "treatise" or "continuum", and is applied to a variety of mystical, occult, medical and scientific works as well as those regarded as "tantric". Most tantras were written in the [[Middle Ages]] and sprang from Hindu cosmology and [[Yoga]].

== Important themes and symbols in Hinduism==
[[Image:YoungBrahminBoy.jpg|thumb|175px|right|This young [[India]]n brahmachari bears on his forehead the distinctive triple-line [[tilaka]] (made out of ash, referred to as ''vibhuti'') and on his chest a [[rudraksha]] (eye of [[Rudra]]) and [[mala]] (rosary), both symbols of Lord [[Shiva]]]]
=== Tilaka (symbol on forehead or between eyebrows) ===
{{main|Tilaka}}
The ''tilaka'' (or ''tilak'') is a tattoo worn on the forehead and other parts of the body for spiritual reasons. It is believed to symbolize the need to cultivate supramental consciousness, which is achieved by opening the mystic ''third eye''. Although traditionally adorned, in one form or the other, by Brahmins (to denote the priestly class in Hindu society) and married women (to denote marriage and auspiciousness), in the modern context, it is most commonly seen as a decorative dot (or ''Bindi'') worn by women on the forehead.

Hindus stress meditation to acquire knowledge beyond the mind and body, a trait that is often associated with the ascetic deity [[Shiva]]. Men, too, will bear on their foreheads the equivalent ''Tika'' ([[tilaka]]) mark, usually on religious occasions, its shape often representing particular devotion to a certain main deity: a 'U' shape stands for [[Vishnu]], a group of three horizontal lines for [[Shiva]]. It is not uncommon for some to meld both in an amalgam marker signifying ''Hari-Hara'' (Vishnu-Shiva indissoluble).

=== Ahimsa (non-violence), vegetarian diet and the cow ===
{{main articles|[[Ahimsa]], [[Sacred cow]], and [[Vegetarianism]]}}
Ahimsa is a concept that advocates non-violence and a respect for all forms of life — human as well as animal. The term ''ahimsa'' first appears in the [[Upanishad]]s, and is the first of the five ''Yamas'', or eternal vows/restraints in [[Raja Yoga]]. 

A large section of Hindus embrace vegetarianism in a bid to respect higher forms of life. While vegetarianism is not a dogma or requirement, it is recommended as a [[sattwa|sattwic]] (purifying) lifestyle. About 30% of today's [[Hindu]] population, especially in orthodox communities in [[South India]], states like Gujarat, which has had significant [[Jain]] influence, and in many [[Brahmin]] and [[Marwari]] enclaves around the subcontinent, are lacto-vegetarian. Some avoid even [[onion]] and [[garlic]], as they are regarded as [[rajasic]]/tamasic.

Those [[Hindus]] who do eat meat (usually chicken, goat and fish) predominantly abstain from [[beef]]. Some even avoid the use of cow's leather products. This is possibly because the largely pastoral Vedic people, and subsequent generations, relied so heavily on the cow for milk and dairy products, tilling of fields and fuel for fertilizer, that its status as a 'caretaker' led to identifying it as an almost maternal figure (hence the term ''gau mata'', or ''Cow Mother''). While most Hindus do not actually worship the cow (though many [[veneration|venerate]] her), it still holds an honored place in Hindu society — as the best representative of the benevolence of all animals on man. It is believed that [[Krishna]] is both [[Govinda]] (herder of cows) and Gopala (protector of cows), and [[Shiva]]'s attendant is [[Nandi Bull|Nandi]], the bull. With the stress on vegetarianism (usually followed even by meat-eating Hindus on religious days) and the [[Sacred cow|sacred nature of the cow]], most of the Hindu holy cities have a ban on selling beef — and a legal ban exists on cow-slaughter in almost all states of India.

=== Hindu symbolism ===
Among the most revered symbols in Hinduism, three are quintessentially a part of its culture, and representative of its general ethos:

[[Image:Om2.jpg|right|thumb|165px|[[Aum]] ([[Om]])]]
[[Image:HinduSwastika.svg|right|thumb|165px|[[Swastika]]]]
[[Image:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|right|thumb|165px|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
[[AUM|'''''Aum''''']] (or Om, '''ॐ''') is the sacred symbol of Hinduism, and is prefixed and sometimes suffixed to all Hindu [[mantra]]s and prayers. It contains a deep symbolic message of the divine primordial vibration of the Universe, representing all existence, encompassing all of nature into the ''One Ultimate Reality''. This symbol is commonly found on necklaces worn by Hindus.

'''[[Swastika]]''' ('''卐''') is an [[Arya]], or ''noble and auspicious'' symbol. It stands for [[satya]], truth, and stability within the power of [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]] or, alternatively, of [[Surya]], the sun. Its rotation in four directions has been used to represent many ideas, but primarily describes the four directions, the four Vedas and their harmonious whole. It has been used predominantly in Hinduism since the early [[Vedic civilization|Vedic culture]], and is still widespread in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Many other cultures continue to hold it as auspicious, in spite of the recent association with [[Nazism]], which used a modified version of this symbol.

The '''[[Mandala]]''' of the hexagram, somewhat resembling the [[Star of David]], is an archetypal symbol for the sacred union of opposite energies. Formed by the intertwining of the "fire" and "water" triangles (the male "blade" and the female "chalice") this symbol represents the masculine and feminine principles in perfect union. In [[India]] the symbol represents the "cosmic dance" of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]]. The Star symbol has been found on temples in India from almost 10,000 years ago. In addition to the balance between man and woman, the Star symbolizes the [[Nara-Narayana]], or perfect meditative balancing state achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[Moksha]]", or "[[Nirvana]]", i.e., release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings.

===Murtis (icons)===
{{main|Murti}}
[[Image:Nataraja.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The dancing posture of Lord [[Siva]], known as the [[Nataraja]], is often said to be the supreme statement of Hindu art]]
Whether believing in the One source as formless (nirguna brahman, without attributes) or as a personal God (saguna Brahman, with attributes), Hindus understand that the one truth may be seen as different to different people. The philosophy of Bhakti seeks contact with the personal source of Brahman, which explains the proliferation of so many Gods and Goddesses (sic) in India, often reflecting the singular inclinations of small regions or groups of people. 

Worship of God is often represented symbolically through the aid of icons (''murti'') which are conduits for the devotee's consciousness, markers for the human mind that signify the ineffable and illimitable nature of the power and grandeur of [[God]]. They are symbols of the greater principle and according to the understanding of the worshipper, the concept or entity is sometimes presumed to be present in them (in monotheistic doctrines) and sometimes not (in monistic doctrines). 

In a [[Mandir|Hindu Temple]], the divine spirit/energy is commonly invoked into the Murtis at the time of their consecration. [[Veneration]] of such Murtis is done everyday in a [[Mandir|temple]]. Most practicing Hindus also maintain a Puja room like a [[Mandir|temple]] in their homes for worship and meditation. The icons could be two-dimensional paintings or three-dimensional statues. It bears mention that ''Shiva'' is almost always worshipped as a pillar-like stone called ''[[Lingam]]''. Some interpret the term ''lingam'' as a [[Phallus]] due to its shape and certain Puranic stories, but actually, this Sanskrit word means ''any'' sign, symbol, mark or badge in general. Others interpret it as a mystic column (''stambha'') trying to represent the infiniteness of ''Shiva''.

Some of deities worshipped are [[Vishnu]] (as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]]), [[Swaminarayan]],  [[Shiva]], [[Devi]] (the Mother as many female deities, such as [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswati]], [[Kali]] and [[Durga]]), [[Ganesha]], [[Agni]], [[Skanda]] and [[Hanuman]].  Also, the [[Puranas]] list twenty-five avatars of [[Vishnu]] : [[Caturasana]], [[Narad]], [[Varaha]], [[Matsya]], [[Yajna]], [[Nara-Narayana]], [[Kapila]], [[Dattatreya]], [[Hayasirsa]], [[Hamsa (purana)|Hamsa]], [[Prsnigarbha]], [[Rsabha]], [[Prithu]], [[Narasimha]] , [[Kurma]], [[Dhanvantari]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parasurama]], [[Raghavendra]], [[Vyasa]], [[Balarama]], [[Krishna]] and [[Kalki]].

===Sanskrit===
{{main|Sanskrit}}

[[Sanskrit]] is mostly used as a ceremonial language in Hindu religious rituals in the forms of [[hymns]] and [[mantras]]. Its pre-classical form of [[Vedic]] Sanskrit, the liturgical language of the Vedic religion, is one of the earliest attested members of the [[Indo-European language]] family, its most archaic text being the [[Rig Veda]].

===Mantra===
{{main|Mantra}}

Reciting [[mantra]]s or incantations is a general practice in Hindu rituals. Many mantras are from the Vedas. Much of ''mantra yoga'', as it is called, is done through ''japa'' (repetition, usually through a [[rosary]]). Mantras are chanted, through their meaning, sound, and chanting style, to help meditational focus for the [[sadhaka]] (practitioner). They can also be used to aid in expression of love for the deity, another facet of [[Bhakti yoga]] akin to the understanding of the [[murti]]. They often give courage in exigent times and serve to help 'invoke' one's inner spiritual strength. Indeed, [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s dying words were a two-word [[mantra]] to the Lord [[Rama]]: ''"Hé Ram!"'.

The most revered mantra in Hinduism is the famed [[Gayatri Mantra]] of the [[Rig Veda]] 3.62.10 (see [[Sanskrit]] for pronunciation):	 
:[[Devanagari]]: {{Unicode|ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः। तत् सवितुर्वरेण्यम्। भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि। धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्।}}	 
:Transliteration ([[IAST]]): {{Unicode|Om bhūrbhuvasvaḥ ; tat saviturvareyam ; bhargo devasya dhīmahi ; dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt .}}	 
:Pronunciation ([[IPA]]): / {{IPA|oːm bʰuːr bʰuvə svəh ; tət səvitur vəreːɳjəm ; bʰərgoː deːvəsjə dʰiːməɦi ; dʰijoː joː nəh prəcoːdəjɑːt .}}/	 
:Translation: "Om! May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the Lord / so may He stimulate our prayers."	 
		 
It is considered one of the most sacred of all Hindu mantras, invoking the universal [[Brahman]] as the principle of knowledge and the illumination of the primordial Sun. Many Hindus to this day, in a tradition that has continued unbroken for at least 3,000 years, perform morning ablutions at the bank of a sacred river (especially the [[Ganga]]/[[Ganges]]) while chanting this mantra.

== Criticism ==
Hinduism is criticized based on current or past regressive social customs such as [[Dowry]], [[Sati]] and [[Caste|casteism]]. 

Hinduism has also been viewed as polytheistic and promoting idol worship. It is to be noted that the term, "Hinduism" itself is an amorphous concept. Only an Advaitan or a follower of [[Advaita]] philosophy, such as [[Smartas]] believe that multiple forms of God are equivalent. For example, a [[Vaishnavite]] considers [[Vishnu]] to be the supreme God and [[Saivites]] consider [[Siva]] respectively as the supreme God. The Hindu counter argument is that Hinduism, specifically Smarta or Advaitan Hinduism is not [[polytheistic]], though it may present an appearance of being so to external observers not familiar with its philosophy. [[monism|Monism]] or [[monistic theism|Monistic Theism]] is generally more apt definition of the Hindu worldview, with the exception of [[Dvaita]], or dualism. The existence of numerous ''human forms'' and ''idols'' of God is an implied principle in Hindu thought. Each ''human form'' or ''idol'' is associated with an important fable, and these representations help people remember and contemplate over them more easily. Rather, criticized idol worship is in actuality veneration of an icon, where an icon is used to focus on God, rather than being the object of worship itself.

Hinduism, specifically, Smarta/Advaitan Hinduism has been viewed as a tolerant religion because it does not subscribe to similar ideas of false God or idolatry because this branch of Hinduism is not fixed on one concept of God. However, the other branches of Hinduism, although they are fixed on one concept of God, (i.e., [[Vaishnavism]],) for example, they adhere to the Vedic principle: "Truth is one, the wise call by different names." Many outsiders view the Hindu "gods and goddesses" and mythology as only sexuality and violence — which consequently makes the Hindu deities appear immoral. Hindus strongly condemn such interpretations, most of which, according to them, is not only a shallow analysis of the Hindu religion but also willfull and gross misinterpretation of Hindu iconography and mythology.
