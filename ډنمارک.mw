== تاريخ ==
{{ژباړل}}
:''Main article: [[History of Denmark]]''

The exact origin of Denmark has been lost in history. The oldest [[Danevirke]] is from the seventh century, appearing at the same time as the new [[Runic alphabet]]. The oldest town, [[Ribe]], was founded around the year 700.

=== Origins ===
The Danish settlers appearing out of a dark spot in history at 700 came from [[Scandinavia]] and spoke an early form of [[north Germanic]]. Prior to their arrival, Most of [[Jutland]] and part of the islands had been vacated or partly vacated by the earlier [[Jutes]], the descendants of populations known to be there from sources in ancient history (such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Ptolemy]]).

The Jutes must have spoken an early form of [[North Sea Germanic]], from which [[English language|English]] is in part descended. A large part of them were known as the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]]. They vacated Jutland en masse to take up residence in the land now named after them, [[England]].

The deserted character of the relatively vacant Jutland probably accounts for the name, Denmark, "wooded country", which is parallel to [[Holland]] and [[Holstein]], "woodland", with a connotation of low or hollow land, as in a vale, and was a common naming theme of peoples around the Baltic Sea.
The Scandinavians moved into the region for defensive purposes, and because it was there to moved into, taking over farms abandoned by the Jutes. Scandinavians were still "pouring forth" from Scandinavia like a swarm of bees, in the language of a [[Goths|Goth]] of Scandinavian descent, [[Jordanes]].

Were the people designated by [[Old Norse]] (ON) Danr, appearing also in ON danagjald, "Danegeld", the residents of [[Old English]] (OE) Denemearc, or was the latter named after the people known in Late Latin as the Dani? There is no prior record of any Germanic Dani in history (unless you count the -din- in [[Scandinavia]]).

There are many gaps in history; nevertheless, Klein's ''Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary'' derives the word from ON danir, "lowlanders", which it relates to such words as English den and down, and OE denu, "valley". According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary'', a down is "an expanse of rolling, grassy, treeless upland" and comes from Germanic *dunaz, from which our dune. The [[Indo-european]] would be *dheuƏ-, "come full circle". Whether a den, down, dune, dale or tundra, the place in which the danir lived was very special and delimited by a circle around the self, within which you herded your animals and built your farms and protective walls to defend yourself, and from which you conducted military and business operations.

=== Viking age ===
Up until the 10th century the Danes were known as [[Vikings]], together with [[Norwegians]] and [[Swedes]], colonising, raiding and trading in all parts of [[Europe]]. Viking explorers first discovered [[Iceland]] by accident in the ninth century, en route to the [[Faroe Islands]]. 

At various times the King of Denmark has ruled parts of [[England]] and [[Ireland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[France]], especially [[Normandy]] and the [[Virgin Islands]], [[Tranquebar]] in [[India]], [[Estonia]] and what is now Northern [[Germany]]. [[Skåne|Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]] were part of Denmark for most of its early history, but were lost to Sweden in 1658. The [[Denmark-Norway|union with Norway]] was dissolved in 1814, when Norway entered a new union with Sweden (until 1905).

=== Modern Denmark ===
The Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the European [[Revolutions of 1848]] Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] [[June 5]] [[1849]].

After the [[Second War of Schleswig]] (Danish: ''Slesvig'') in 1864 Denmark was forced to cede [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to [[Prussia]], in a defeat that left deep marks in the Danish national identity. After this point Denmark adopted a policy of neutrality, as a result of which Denmark stayed neutral in [[World War I]].  Following the defeat of Germany, Denmark was offered by the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles powers]] the return of Schleswig-Holstein. Fearing German [[irredentism]] Denmark refused to consider the return of Holstein and insisted on a [[plebiscite]] concerning the return of Schleswig. In 1920, following the plebiscite, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark.

Despite its continued neutrality Denmark was invaded by [[Germany]] (''[[Operation Weserübung]]),'' on [[April 9]], [[1940]].  Though at first accorded self-rule (which ended in 1943 due to a mounting resistance movement), Denmark remained [[Occupation of Denmark|militarily occupied]] throughout [[World War II]]. The Danish sympathy for the Allied Cause was strong; 1,900 Danish Police Officers were arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sent, under guard, to be interned in [[Buchenwald]].  After the war, Denmark became one of the founding members of [[NATO]] and, in 1973, joined the [[EEC|European Economic Community]] (later, the [[European Union]]).

== Politics and government ==
:''Main article: [[Politics of Denmark]]''

Denmark is the oldest [[monarchy]] in [[Europe]]. In 1849, it became a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the adoption of a new [[constitution]]. The [[List of Danish monarchs|monarch]] is formally [[head of state]], a role which is mainly ceremonial, since [[executive power]], while exercised by the monarch, is exercised through the [[cabinet ministers]], with the prime minister acting as the [[first among equals]] (''[[primus inter pares]]''). [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the monarch and the Danish [[parliament]], known as the ''[[Folketing]]'', which consists of (no more than) 179 members. The judiciary power rests with the [[courts of Denmark|court]].

Elections for parliament must be held at least every four years; but the prime minister can call for an earlier election. Should parliament succeed in a [[vote of no confidence]] against the Prime Minister the entire government resigns. The country is often run by minority governments.

Denmark practices universal suffrage and in all matters, women are considered equal to men by Danish law. Except that they are not drafted, but they may choose to serve on a voluntarily basis

The [[death sentence]] was abolished in Denmark in 1930.  It was briefly reintroduced after [[World War II]], by popular demand.  46 people were executed for war crimes, after which the death sentence saw no use for years.  In 1978 it was finally abolished again.  It is illegal per Danish law to extradite citizens to countries where the citizen would face the death sentence.

== Counties ==
:''Main article: [[Counties of Denmark]]''

Denmark is divided into 13 [[county|counties]] (''[[Amt (subnational entity)|amter]]'', singular: ''amt''), and 271 [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] (''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommuner]]'', singular ''kommune''). Three municipalities have county privileges - Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, and Bornholm. The coming Danish Municipal Reform will replace the counties with five new [[Regions of Denmark|regions]] and reduce the number of municipalities to 98. The new municipalities will take over most of the responsibilities of the former counties. Most of the new municipalities will have a population of at least 20,000 people. The reform will be implemented on [[1 January]] [[2007]].

Copenhagen County comprises the municipalities of metropolitan Copenhagen, except Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg Municipality. Bornholm Regional Municipality comprise the five former municipalities on the island Bornholm and the island's former county.

[[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] also belong to the Kingdom of Denmark, but have autonomous status and are largely self-governing, and are each represented by two seats in the parliament.

== Demographics ==
:''Main article: [[Demographics of Denmark]]''

The majority of the population is of Scandinavian descent, with small groups of [[Inuit]] (from [[Greenland]]), [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and immigrants. According to official statistics in 2003 immigrants made up 6.2% of the total population.

[[Danish language|Danish]] is spoken in the entire country, although a small group near the German border also speaks [[German language|German]].  Many Danes are fluent in [[English Language|English]] as well, particularly those in larger cities and the youth, who are taught English in school.

Of the [[religions in Denmark]], according to official statistics from January 2002, 84.3% of Danes are members of the [[Lutheran]] state church, the [[Church of Denmark|Danish People's Church]] (''Den Danske Folkekirke''), also known as the Church of Denmark. The rest are primarily of other [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations and also about 2% are [[Muslim]]s.

== Geography ==
[[دوتنه:Da-map.png|thumb|right|150px|Map of Denmark]]

:''Main article: [[Geography of Denmark]]''

Denmark consists of the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland]] ''(Jylland)'' and 405 named [[island]]s. Of these, 323 are inhabited, with the largest being [[Zealand]] ''(Sjælland)'' and [[Funen]] ''(Fyn)''. The island of [[Bornholm]] is located somewhat east of the rest of the country, in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the [[Øresund Bridge]] connects Zealand with [[Sweden]], the [[Great Belt Bridge]] connects Funen with Zealand, and the Small Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen.  [[Ferry|Ferries]] connect one to the smaller islands.

The country is mostly flat with little elevation; the highest natural point is [[Møllehøj]], at 170.86 metres (560.6&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The climate is [[temperate]], with mild winters and cool summers. Main cities are the capital [[Copenhagen]] (on Zealand), [[Aarhus]], [[Aalborg]] (on Jutland) and [[Odense]] (on Fyn).

== اقتصاد ==
:''Main article: [[Economy of Denmark]]''
{{factbook section}}
[[دوتنه:DanishKroners.jpg|thumb|right|Danish Krone.]]

This thoroughly modern market economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable living standards, a stable currency, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and has a comfortable balance of payments surplus.

The Danish economy is highly unionized; 75% of its labour force [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/10/business/unions2.html] are members of a union in the [[Danish Confederation of Trade Unions]].  Relationships between unions and employers are cooperative: unions have a day-to-day role in managing the workplace, and their representatives sit on most companies' [[board of directors]].  Rules on work schedules and pay are negotiated between unions and employers, with minimal government involvement.

The government has been very successful in meeting, and even exceeding, the economic convergence criteria for participating in the third phase (a common European currency) of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] (EMU), but Denmark, in a September 2000 [[referendum]], reconfirmed its decision not to join the 12 other EU members in the [[euro]]. Even so, the Danish currency remains pegged to the euro.

Denmark has also placed first on the Economist Intelligence Unit's "e-readiness" rankings for the past two years. "A country's "e-readiness" is a measure of its e-business environment, a collection of factors that indicate how amenable a market is to Internet-based opportunities."

== کلتور/فرهڼ ==
:''Main article: [[Culture of Denmark]]''

Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually an English mythical figure: [[Hamlet]], the title character of [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play, which was set in the real castle of [[Kronborg]] in [[Elsinore|Helsingør]], north of Copenhagen.  Another widely known Dane is [[Hans Christian Andersen]], in Denmark referred to as H. C. Andersen, a writer mostly famous for such fairy tales as [[The Emperor's New Clothes]], [[The Little Mermaid]], and [[The Ugly Duckling]].
