[[دوتنه:La Fête à Abomey(1908). - Danse de fêticheuses de Fon.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at [[Abomey]], 1908]]
The African kingdom of [[Dahomey]] originated in Benin. By the [[17th century]], the kingdom, ruled by an ''oba'', stretched beyond the borders of present-day Benin, covering a large part of West-Africa. The kingdom was prosperous and established slave trading relations with the [[Europe]]ans (mostly [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]]) who first arrived in the late 15th century. The coastal part of the kingdom became known as the [[Slave Coast]].

By the [[18th century]], Dahomey started to fall apart, enabling the [[France|French]] to take over the area in [[1892]]. In [[1899]], the land became part of the [[French West Africa]] colony, still as Dahomey. In [[1958]], it was granted autonomy as the Republic of Dahomey, and full independence started on [[August 1]], [[1960]].

For the next 12 years, ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence. There were several coups and regime changes, with three main figures dominating - [[Sourou Apithy]], [[Hubert Maga]], and [[Justin Ahomadegbé]] - each of them representing a different area of the country. These three agreed to form a presidential council after violence had marred the [[1970]] elections. In [[1972]], a military coup led by [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the council. He established a [[marxism|Marxist]] government under the control of [[Military Council of the Revolution]] (CNR), and the country was renamed to the People's Republic of Benin in [[1975]]. In [[1979]], the CNR was dissolved and elections took place. By the late [[1980s]], Kérékou abandoned Marxism after an economic crisis and decided to re-establish a parliamentary [[capitalist]] system. He was defeated in [[1991]] elections, becoming the first black African president to step down after an election. He returned to power after winning the [[1996]] vote. In [[2001]], a closely fought election resulted in Kérékou winning another term. His opponents claimed there were some election irregularities.

{{Politics of Benin}}
The parliament of Benin is formed by the 83-seat National Assembly (''Assemblée Nationale''), for which elections are held every four years. Head of the government and head of state is the president, who is chosen in separate presidential elections held every five years. The president appoints a council of ministers. According to the constitution of [[1990]], a president may serve a maximum of 2 five-year terms. There is also a 70-year age limit for presidential candidates.

:''Main article: [[Geography of Benin]]''
Stretched between the [[Niger River]] in the north and the [[Bight of Benin]] in the south, Benin's elevation is about the same for the entire country. Most of the population lives in the southern coastal plains, where Benin's largest cities are also located, including [[Porto Novo]] and [[Cotonou]]. The north of the country consists mostly of [[savanna]] and semi-arid highlands.

The climate in Benin is hot and humid with relatively little rain, although there are two rainy seasons (April-July and September-November).

== اقتصاد ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Benin]]''

The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, [[cotton]] production, and regional trade. Growth in real output has averaged a stable 5% in the past six years, but rapid population rise has offset much of this increase. [[Inflation]] has subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on [[tourism]], facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. The 2001 privatization policy should continue in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture in spite of initial government reluctance. The [[Paris Club]] and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, while pressing for speeded-up structural reforms.

''Main article: [[Demographics of Benin]]''

There are about 40 different ethnic groups living in Benin, the largest being the [[Fon people|Fon]] who account for about 49% of Benin's population. Other ethnic groups include the [[Adja]], [[Yoruba]], Somba and [[Bariba]]. Most of these ethnic groups have their own languages, although [[French language|French]] is the official language, which is spoken mostly in the cities. Of the indigenous languages, the [[Fon language|Fon]] and [[Yoruba language]]s are most common.

Indigenous religions are predominant, although significant parts of the population are [[christianity|Christian]] (chiefly [[Catholic Church in Benin|Roman Catholic]]) and [[Islam|Muslim]]. Local practices and traditions are often combined with those of Christianity and Islam.

== کلتور/فرهڼ ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Benin]]''

It is believed that [[Vodun]] (or "Voodoo", as it is commonly known) originated in Benin and was introduced to [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean Islands]], and parts of North America by [[slavery|slaves]] taken from this particular area of the [[Slave Coast]]. The indigenous religion of Benin is practiced by about 60% of the population. Since 1992 Vodun has been recognized as one of Benin's official religions, and a National Vodun Holiday is celebrated on January 10.
