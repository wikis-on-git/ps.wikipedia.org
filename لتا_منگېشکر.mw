==ماشومتوب==
لتا منګېشکر د هندوستان د [[مدهيا پرادېش]] په [[اندور]] کې نړۍ ته راغلې. نوموړې د کلاسيک سندرغاړي او نندارې لوبګر [[دينانات منګېشکر]] او د هغه د دوهمې ښځې [[شودماتي منګېشکر]] لور ده. A [[middle-class]] [[Marathi people|Maharashtrian]] family, part of the [[Saraswat Brahmin]] [[caste]], she was the firstborn child, to be followed by siblings [[هريدايانات منګېشکر]]، [[آشا بوسلې]]، [[اوشا منګېشکر]] او [[مينا منګېشکر]]. 

Raised in [[Maharashtra]], at the age of five Mangeshkar started working as an actress in several plays known as ''"sangeet nataks"'' in which her father was performing.  Her father also started giving her singing lessons.  Dinanath's recitals and lessons left a strong impression on his daughter, as did the music of [[K.L. Saigal]], who was her fathers favorite singer.

==د ۱۹۴۰ کالونه==
Mangeshkar's first cinematic song was for the film ''[[Kiti Hasaal]]'' (1942), produced by [[Vasant Joglekar]]. However, her father disliked the idea for any of his daughters singing for movies, so the song was dropped from the film.  

In [[1942]], when she was 13, her father died of [[heart disease]].  Due to the death of her father and financial need, she played cameo roles in many [[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]] and [[Marathi]] films, despite not enjoying acting.  Her first cameo was in ''[[Pahili Mangalagaur]]'' (1942), where she played the younger sister to actress [[Snehprabha Pradhan]]. Mangeshkar went on to perform in other feature films including, ''[[Maaze Baal]]'', ''[[Jeevan Yatra]]'' ([[1946]]), and ''[[Chhatrapati Shivaji]]'' ([[1952]]).  In ''[[Badi Maa]]'', she acted with [[Noor Jehan]] and her younger sister, Asha.  Not only did she sing for herself, but she also sang [[playback singing|playback]] for Asha. 

In [[1945]], composer [[Ghulam Haider]] took Mangeshkar to meet producer [[S. Mukherji]], who was planning to make a movie starring actress [[Kamini Kaushal]].  Haider wanted the producer to give sixteen-year-old Lata a chance to sing.  Mukherji dismissed her voice, annoying Haider, who said "Let me fortell today that this girl will soon put to shame everyone else, including Noor Jehan. Producers and directors will fall at her feet, begging her to sing in their films." [http://www.bollywoodvillage.com/events-of-lata-mangeshkar.asp] 

In [[1947]], Vasant Joglekar called again, employing her to sing in his film, ''[[Aapki Seva Mein]]''.  The songs composed by [[Datta Daavjekar]] such as "paa laagoon kar jori re..." (a thumri in Raag Piloo) helped establish Mangeshkar as a playback singer in [[Bollywood]].  Also singing in the film ''[[Majboor]]'' which provided Lata with hits such as 'Angrezi chhora chala gaya', 'Dil mera toda Haaye', and 'Mujhe kahinka na choda tere pyaar ne'.  

In [[1949]], Mangeshakar got her big break with the song 'Aayega Aanewaala' from the film ''[[Mahal]]''.  The song was for Bollywood star [[Madhubala]] and was composed by [[Khemchand Prakash]].  The song was a big hit, and a major turning point for the careers of both the singer and the film star.  [[Raj Kapoor|Raj Kapoor's]] film ''[[Barsaat]]'' with music by [[Shankar-Jaikishan]], also provided hits for the young singer with the songs 'Jiya beqarar hai' and 'Chhod gaye baalam'.

The film ''[[Ek Thi Ladki]]'' ([[1949]]) featured the famous track 'Lara lappa Lara lappa' composed by Vinod.  The song became so popular that the actress in the film who it was performed for, [[Meena Shorey]], became known as the 'Lara lappa Lara lappa girl'. 

Lata closed the 1940s performing vocals for more songs such as those in the film Badi Bahen, with music by Husnalal Bhagatram. She also sang beautiful songs such as "mere liye woh gham-e-intezaar chhod gaye" for Anil Biswas in the film Anokha Pyaar.

==د ۱۹۵۰ کالونه==
The [[1950]]s saw Lata become a favorite singer of composers like Shankar Jaikishan, [[Sachin Dev Burman]], [[C. Ramchandra]], [[Madan Mohan]], [[Hemant Kumar]] and [[Salil Chowdhury]] amongst others, including filmmaker [[Raj Kapoor]].

With Sachin Dev Burman and writer [[Sahir Ludhianvi]] she performed in the films ''[[Sazaa]]'' ([[1951]]) and ''[[House of No. 44]]''([[1955]]).

Alongside composer [[Hemant Kumar]], Mangeshkar went on to perform in films such as ''[[Nagin]]'' ([[1954]]), ''[[Champakali]]'' ([[1957]]), and ''[[Anand Math]]'' ([[1951]]).

Mangeshkar performed numerous tracks for composer/writer duo C. Ramchandra and [[Rajendra Krishan]] in films like ''[[Anarkali]]'' ([[1953]]), ''[[Albela]]'' ([1951]), ''[[Samadhi]]'' ([[1950]]), ''[[Nirala]]'' (1950), ''[[Amar Deep]]'' ([[1958]]) and ''[[Azaad]]'' (1955).

Lata and Rajendra Krishan also teamed up with the composer Madan Mohan to create various [[ghazal]]s for the films ''[[Adaalat]]'' (1958), and ''[[Jailor]]'' (1958).

Teaming up with Shankar Jaikishan and lyricists [[Hasrat Jaipuri]] and [[Shailendra]], she recorded tracks for films ''[[Chori Chori]]'' ([[1956]]), and ''[[Patita]]'' (1953).  Raj Kapoor often had Lata for his films such as Shree 420 and Anari, performing duets with [[Manna Dey]] and Mukesh. 

Mangeshkar and Shailendra also teamed up with composer Salil Chowdhury to create music for [[Bimal Roy]] films such as ''[[Madhhumati]]'' (1958).  Once, [[Salil Chowdhury]] sang an emotional [[Bengali language|Bengali]] song at Bimal Roy's request. After the song was finished, he found that Lata had [[fainted]]. She later told him - "I was so overcome that I couldn't control myself". [http://www.bollywoodvillage.com/events-of-lata-mangeshkar.asp]  Lata recorded some of her most memorable songs with Salil Chowdhury, including 'Raaton ke saaye', 'Chhoti si baat', 'O Sajna barkha bahaar aayee' (''[[Parakh]]''), 'Aaja re pardesi' (''[[Madhumati]]''), and 'Itna na mujhse tu pyaar badhaa' (''[[Chhaya]]'').

In [[1961]] she performed the [[bhajan]] 'Allah tero naam' in ''[[Hum dono]]'' written by Sahir Ludhiyanvi and composed by Sachin Dev Burman's assistant, Jaidev.  

In 1962, Lata sang the non-film patriotic song 'Aye mere watan ke logon' at a function. The composer was C. Ramchandra and the lyricist was poet [[Pradeep]]. The song moved Indian [[Prime Minister]], Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to tears. [[http://www.rumela.com/women/lata_mangeshkar.htm]] At this time Mangeshkar started dabbling in [[Middle-Eastern]] songs as well, performing 'Aye Dilruba' in ''[[Roustam Sohrab]]'' ([[1963]]) for composer Sajjad Hussain. 

Teaming with Hasrat Jaipuri and Shankar-Jaikishan, Lata performed 'Ehsaan tera hoga mujh par' for ''[[Junglee]]'' ([[1961]]). Again, with Shankar-Jaikishan and this time with lyricist Shailendra, Mangeshkar performed in ''[[Dil Ek Mandir]]'' (1963) and ''[[Amrapali (film)|Amrapali]]'' ([[1966]]). 

After a long hiatus, S D Burman and Mangeshkar teamed up again for songs in Bandini and Dr. Vidya, followed by [[Dev Anand|Dev Anand's]] ''[[Guide (film)|Guide]]'' ([[1965]]) and [[1969|1969's]] ''[[Aradhana (1969 Hindu Film)|Aradhana]]'' singing duets with [[Kishore Kumar]].  Again with Burman, she once again performed with singer [[Mohammed Rafi]] in the film ''[[Jewel Thief]]''. The two had a major fall out regarding royalty payments from previous film work together, and made up during a live onstage performance, coming together to perform again.  In the early 60s, Lata Mangeshkar also recorded R D Burman's first film song - "ghar aaja ghir aaye badaraa" in the film Chhote Nawaab. Collaborations with R D Burman continued in films such as Pati Patni and Baharon Ke Sapane amongst many others. 

Lata performed for composer Roshan and writer [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]] in [[1966]] for the film ''[[Mamta (film)|Mamta]]''. In [[1967]] with Roshan and lyricist [[Sahir Ludhiyanvi]] for the film ''[[Bahu Begam]]''.  

The Sixties also gave way to her work with musical duo [[Kalyanji-Anandji]], where she performed in such films as ''[[Saraswati Chandra]]'', performing with [[Mukesh]].  Again the duo teamed up with Mangeshkar for 'O mere mitwa' from the film ''[[Geet (film)|Geet]]'', and lyricists [[Anand Bakshi|Anand Bakshi's]] first hit song 'Yeh sama' from ''[[Jab Jab Phool Khile]]'' (1965). 

Lata gained a close relationship with the team [[Laxmikant Pyarela]] in the late 60s-70s. In [[1967]] she performed in their first film ''[[Shagird]]''.  Continuing her success with "Laxmi-Pyare" she recorded songs for the films ''[[Intadam]]'' (1969), ''[[Milan (Bollywood)|Milan]]'' (with vocalist Mukesh) (1967), and ''[[Do Raaste]]] (1969), continuing again with films well into the 1970s. 

Throughout the 1960s she performed for Madan Mohan, famed Bollywood music composer, in films such as ''[[Anpadh]]'' (1962) and ''[[Mera Saaya]]'' (1966).  [[O.P. Nayyar]] said in an interview in [[Dubai]] in [[1992]] that "I don't know whether Lata was created for Madan Mohan or Madan Mohan was created for Lata. But there has never been a composer like Madan Mohan, nor has there been a singer like Lata." [[http://gaurav-kumar.tripod.com/larticle.htm]] 

The late 1960s also gave away to the debut of S D Burman's son, [[Rahul Dev Burman]] as a composer. Lata recorded songs with him for the films ''[[Baharon Ke Sapne]]'' (1967) and ''[[Pyaar Ka Mausam]]'' (1969). In 1966, Mangeshkar sang 'Baharon mera jeevan bhi savaron' for composer [[Khayyam]] and lyricist [[Kaifi Azmi]] in the film ''[[Aakhiri Khat]]''.


The late 60s (and early 70s) also witnessed several non-film albums by the melody queen, mostly composed by her brother. This includes an L-P of Meera bhajans (famous for the exquisite "mhaara re giridhar gopaal" and "kinun sang kheloon holi"), an album of Ghalib ghazals named "kalaam-e-ghalib" and Marathi devotional albums in reverence to Sant Dnyaneshwar, Lord Ganapati and an album in tribute to the noble king Shivaji Maharaj.

Mangeshkar performed tracks for star Meena Kumari, again, this time in the film ''[[Pakeezah]]'' ([[1971]]), with music by [[Ghulam Mohammed (composer)|Ghulam Mohammed]]. 

S.D. Burman's final films were in the 1970s, before falling into a coma and dying in [[1975]].  Lata performed in the films ''[[Prem Pujari]]'', ''[[Sharmilee]]'' (1971), and ''[[Abhimaan]]'' ([[1973]]). In ''Abhimaan'' she performed vocals at the age of 44, for 25-year-old actress [[Jaya Bachchan]].

She also released an album of Meera bhajans composed by her brother. The album was titled "Chala Vaahi Des". Some of the bhajans in the album include "saanware rang raachi" and "ud jaa re kaaga".

Continuing their relationship from the 60's into the 70's, Lata and Laxmi-Pyare were together again (with Rahul Dev Burman in the mix).  Writers Anand Bakshi and [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]] wrote most of the tracks, penning songs for the films ''[[Amar Prem]]'' (1971), ''[[Caravan (film)|Caravan]]'' (1971), and Raj Kapoor's ''[[Satyam Shivam Sundaram]]'' ([[1978]]).  Mangeshkar and Kishore Kumar performed songs for R D Burman and lyricist [[Gulzar]] in the film ''[[Aandhi]]'' in 1975. R D Burman also effectively tapped the melody in Lata's throat in the songs of the wonderful film Kinara, famous for "Naam gum jaayega" and "abke na saawan barse".

Mangeshkar performed in 1976 for composer Khayyam and songwriter Sahi Ludhiyanvi for the film ''[[Kabhi Kabhie]]'', and again with Khayyam in ''[[Shankar Hussain]]'' in 1977 and "Chambal ki Kasam" in 1979. She also sang for Naushad in "Chambal ki Raani".

In 1980s, Lata voluntarily cut down on her singing to allow new younger talent to come up. In [[1983]], Lata once again worked with Khayyam for the movie [[Razia Sultan]], singing the song ''Aye dil-e-naadaan.'' 

[[Ravindra Jain]], the blind composer who was given a big break by [[Raj Kapoor]] in ''[[Ram Teri Ganga Maili]]'', got Lata to sing popular songs like ''Sun Sahiba Sun''. 

[[Ramlaxman]] was another new composer who worked with Lata in many [[Rajashri Production]]s movies, including ''[[Maine Pyaar Kiya]]'', ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Kaun]]'' and ''[[Hum Saath Saath Hain]]''. ''Maine Pyaar Kiya'' ([[1989]]) was [[Salman Khan]]'s second film and set a record of sorts. The songs sung by Lata and [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]] became popular - ''Dil Deewana'', ''Kabootar ja ja'', ''Aaja shaam hone aai'' and the title song.

In late 1970s and early [[1980s]], Lata worked with the children of composers she had earlier worked with. Apart from Sachin and Rahul Dev Burman, Lata worked has worked with Chitragupta and his sons Anand-Milind, Roshan and his son [[Rajesh Roshan]], and Sardar Malik and his son [[Anu Mallik]]. Rajesh Roshan's first film ''Julie'' had some numbers sung by Lata, including ''Bhool gaya sab kuchh'' (duet with Kishore Kumar) and ''Yeh Raatein Nai Puraani''.

==د ۱۹۹۰ کالونه==

In 1990, Lata launched her own production house. Her first (and the only) movie as a producer ''[[Lekin]]'' -- flopped, but the music (composed by her brother, Hridaynath) was well-appreciated. The song ''Yaara seeli seeli'', written by [[Gulzar]], is considered to be one of the best songs that Lata has ever sung.

In [[1990s]], Lata also recorded many non-film songs, including ghazals with [[Jagjit Singh]]. One such ghazal is ''Dhuan banake fiza mein'', recorded in [[1992]]. The songs that Lata recorded for Ramlaxman in the Rajashri Productions film [[Hum Aapke Hain Kaun]] were hits.  Lata also sang for all of the [[Yash Chopra]] films, including [[Lamhe]], [[Darr]], [[Yeh Dillagi]], [[Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge]] and [[Dil To Pagal Hai]].

A. R. Rahman has recorded a number of songs with Lata, including ''Jiya Jale'' (from [[Dil Se]], danced by [[Preity Zinta]]) and ''Khamoshiyan Gungunane Lagin''(from One Two ka Four).

لتا منګيشكر؛يو كوډګر غږ ،چې ورو ورو غلی كيږي!


پهيلي لومړنى فلم و، چې لتا د يوې هنرمندې په توګه پكې وځلېده، لتا په دغه فلم كې د فلم د جينۍ " سنيپرابها" د خور په رول كې راڅرګنده شوه.
د هنر ملكه لتا منګيشكرڅه ډول له موسيقۍ او هندي فلمونو سره د هنر پر مبتكر مېز راڅرګنده شوه؟ لتا منګيشكر د خپل وړوكتوب پرمهال له سندغاړي سېګل نه اغيزمنه شوه او له سينما تر راوتلو وروسته يې پرېكړه وكړه، چې لويه شي، له سيګل سره به واده كوي. له هندي فلمونو او سندرو سره يې ناپايه مينه له همدې ځايه پيل شوه. د وخت په تېرېدو سره دا مينه له موسيقۍ سره په يوه تلپاتې ژمنه واوښته.
د لتا منګيشكر پلار" پډيت دينانت منګيشكر" د لتا او موسيقۍ نرمنځ د نږدې او غښتليو اړيكو له مخې وړاندوينه وكړه، چې لور به يې يو مهال د هندوستان د موسيقۍ د ملكې په توګه راڅرګنديږي، خو زمان ډېر زر وښودل، چې دپډيت وړاندواينه يوه رښتينې هيله وه. 
كه څه هم، چې لتا له موسيقۍ سره بې پايه مينه درلوده، خو كورنيو دربدريو دې ته اړ اېسته، چې په هندي فلمونو كې د هنرمندې په توګه رولف ترسره كړي. سوبهادرا، بدى مان، پهيلي او ځينې نور هغه فلمونه و، چې لتا د يوې هنرمندې په توګه پكې راڅرګنده شوه. 
پهيلي لومړنى فلم و، چې لتا د يوې هنرمندې په توګه پكې وځلېده، لتا په دغه فلم كې د فلم د جينۍ " سنيپرابها" د خور په ځېر حركتونه كول. ويل كيږي لتا ته به هميشه خپل پلار او استاد ويل، چې له غرور او ځانځانۍ نه لرې و اوسي. د لتا پلار او استلاد په زړه پورې لارښوونو د هغې د ژوند برخليك او ژونهد لاره وټاكل او دغه څېره يې د يوې شهكارې ملكې په توګه را و پېژندله.
لتا منګيشكر خپل خوږ او احساس پاروونكى غږ په 13 كلنۍ كې له حنجرې را واېست. دا د كرتي حاصل فلم يوه سندره وه، ددغه فلم لارښوونكى واسنت جوګليكر و، ددې سندرې تر ويلو وروسته لتا ته وړانديز شوى و، چې د هندي فلمونو د سندرغاړې په توګه تړون وكړي. لتا دا وړانديز ومانه ، خو پلارې دغه پرېكړه خوښه نه كړه. 
1948 او 1949 كلونه د لتا منګيشكر د شهرت پيل و او دا همغه فلمونهه و، چې د كارپوهانو په وينا د نړۍ په هره برخه كې ليدل كېدل. د لتا منګيشكر لاندينيو سندرو د ډېرو اورېدونكو تنده ماته كړه: ايي ګا انې والا، چلې جانا...، دير سې اجارې ، جايا بېقرارهې.." 
د هندي فلمونو د شهرت په همدې كلونو كې ښه سندرغاړې نورجهان وه، نورجهان د لتا منګيشكرد سندرو ستاينه وكړه او ويې ويل، چې په هندي را روان پېر كې به د لتا په څېر هنرمنده پيدا نشي. 
لتا په خپل هنري ژوندانه كې څلور سترې جايزې ګټلې او تر 30 زرو يې زياتې سندرې ويلې دي، خو اوس داسې برېښي، چې غږ يې ورو ورو غلى كيږي، هغه اوس ډېره زهيره ده، خو غږ يې لا همغسې ازانګې كوي.
