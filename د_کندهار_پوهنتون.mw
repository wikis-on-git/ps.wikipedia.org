==Overview==
[[File:KandaharUniversity-Mosque-2005.JPEG|thumb|right|The [[Mosque]] at Kandahar University (KU)]]
Kandahar University  officially started with the faculty of [[Agriculture]] in 1991. The Faculty of [[Medicine]] was also launched in 1994. [[Engineering]] was established in 2000 and faculty of [[Education]] in 2003. 
The University at the beginning was located at the center of Kandahar city in a campus shared with a [[technical school]]. Due to lack of classes and hostel facilities, a specific area was selected for the University in the north-west of Kandahar city. The work of constructing the new campus started during the governance of [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] who strongly supported and contributed Kandahar University in different aspects.
The current Campus of the University covers an area of more than 600,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The University has 11 buildings, of which one is the Administration and Chancellor’s office, four buildings for a [[hostel]], one for each faculty and one for the [[Central Library]]. The University also has a separate girls' hostel. There are some other structures located in the campus. The most important among them is the [[tomb]] of ''Allama Abdul Shakoor Rishad [[Baba (honorific)|baba]]'' who was a well known writer, artist and poet of Afghanistan. There is also a huge [[mosque]] located beside the University for attending the [[Eidgah]] pray each year.

The Canadian government in 2008 built a three-km perimeter of stone, brick and iron around the school campus. It has been dubbed the Great Wall of Kandahar. The new wall addresses a security and other concerns hampering the school’s development.<ref name=macleans/>

==Agriculture faculty==

Agriculture faculty was the first in Kandahar University. The faculty offers a 4 year agriculture program. [[Professor]] Shah Mahmood Barai is the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of this faculty from the beginning until now. His long term struggles and outstanding administration have achieved many goals in the progression and development of this faculty. The faculty enrolls around 80 students each year. The first two years are basic and generals about Agriculture.

The faculty has 6 departments and selection is made at third year of the course:
* Department of [[Agronomy]] 
* Department of [[Soil Science]] and [[Irrigation]]
* Department of [[Horticulture]], [[Jungles]] and [[Natural Resources]]
* Department of [[Plant Protection]]
* Department of [[Animal Husbandry]]
* Department of Agriculture economy and extension

===Agriculture and animal husbandry farm===
Agricultural and Animal Husbandry [[Farm]] located beside the campus was established in 2004 by joint cooperation of [[ARLDF]] and Agriculture faculty. The farm is located in an area of 22,000 m<sup>2</sup>.  The farm is a good site for the practical activities of agriculture students. The farm coveres activities in the fields of:

Medical faculty was established in 1994, second in Kandahar University after Agriculture. The university has graduated 250 students in bachelor degrees. The faculty is still in a progressive phase, but it has tremendously activated through the years of civil war in Afghanistan when the opportunities for educational institutes were very limited. The faculty has a medical library and laboratory. The students would intern in Mirwais hospital before, but the facult now has its own Hospital. The students have to attend the hospital twice a week starting from 3rd year. The final year is internship, where the students will get hands-on patient experience. The faculty of Medicine has relations with Kabul Medical Institute and Zahidan Medical College located in [[Zahidan]] of Sistan.

==Central library==
[[File:KULibrary.jpg|thumb|The library]]
Although each faculty has its own library, but there is also a central [[library]] located in a 3 story building in Kandahar University. TThe current building is not really specifically designed for a library. A new building will be built specially for library under a [[World Bank]] donation. 
The central library is named after the well-known and famous writer of Afghanistan, ''Allama Habibi''. The library contains 42,000 books. Most of these books are in [[English language]] and some are in [[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Dari]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. The library also has a study room. A computerized database is going to be made for the library to ease the access of students to the books and to solve monitoring problems. Due to a lack of rooms and shelves in the current building, most of the books are still stored in boxes. The library is working on a computerized database for the time.

==IT department==
[[File:ITClass.JPG|thumb|Computer room at KU]]
The department of [[Information technology|IT]] provides computer skills and [[internet]] facilities for the students of Kandahar University. This department has a computer lab which contains 40 computers plus Internet facility.
Mostly the students coming to University are familiar with computers but the department provides extra skills in various software. First year students from each faculty get 2 credits a week to learn computers.

==Laboratory and practice==
Each faculty has its own laboratory. [[Agriculture]] has more sophisticated laboratory among other faculties. It has 3 laboratories in different fields. There is a plan of making a Central laboratory under the donation of the [[World Bank]]. The materials of this laboratory are already received and stored in the University and are only awaiting the building to be build. 
Medical laboratories are not allowed to open up dead bodies. But the students have practical work twice a week in Kandahar Medical faculty hospital. This hospital was recently inaugurated and came under control of the University. It was a Military hospital before. Struggles are going on to make the hospital more sophisticated and accessible for civilians. The students at last year of Medical course intern at [[Mirwais Hospital]] which is a Zonal hospital located in Kandahar city. But the students will soon start their internship program in their own University Hospital.

The students also have some educational trips to other provinces. Recently Horticulture students of Agriculture faculty had an educational trip to [[Jalalabad]]. They visited [[Nangarhar University]], to see their laboratory and different agricultural fields and farms.

==Publications==

Kandahar University has a department of Publication. The University is publishing various magazines which cover different educational, social, cultural, religious, and other issues. The University currently publishes the following magazines:

==Hostel==
Most of the students at Kandahar University are living in a hostel. The campus has both boys' and girls' hostels. However, due to security issues, girls are not willing to live on campus and instead live in the city with their relatives. 4 buildings are specified for boys' hostels. Each building consist about 44 rooms. The number of students varies from 4 to 6 per room. This is because the current buildings are not enough for total students living in the hostel. At the completion of the new campus, [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] ordered a [[Computer]], [[TV]], [[Cupboard]] and a [[Rug]] for each room of the hostel but this did not happen due to his transfer from Kandahar to [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar province]]. The hostel provides free food for the students under the budget of the Ministry of Higher Education. The problem the hostel has is lack of regular electricity, although there is a power generator but not enough or not activated due to lack of fuel.

==Credit System==
The credit educational system was introduced in Medical and Education faculties in October 2007. Credit is an advanced educational system followed in USA, Europe and other countries around the world. A two days workshop was held by the chancellor of KU and introduced the system to around 40 lecturers of relevant faculties.
