'''Sun Tzu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|n|ˈ|d|z|uː}};<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Sun+Tzu "Sun Tzu"]. ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia|Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2013).</ref> also rendered as '''Sun Zi'''; {{lang-zh|孫子}}) was a Chinese general, [[military strategist]], writer, and philosopher who lived in the [[Eastern Zhou period]] of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of ''[[The Art of War]]'', a widely influential work of [[military strategy]] that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. Aside from his legacy as the author of ''The Art of War'', Sun Tzu is revered in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Culture of East Asia|East Asia]]n culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was '''Sun Wu''', and he was known outside of his family by his [[courtesy name]] '''Changqing'''. The name ''Sun Tzu'' by which he is best known in the Western World is an [[Chinese honorifics|honorific]] which means "Master [[Sun (surname)|Sun]]".

Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian [[Sima Qian]] and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to [[King Helü of Wu|King Helü]] of [[state of Wu|Wu]] and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity nonetheless place the existing text of ''The Art of War'' in the later [[Warring States period]] based upon its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sawyer|first=Ralph D.|title=The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00304-4|pages=421–22}}.</ref>
