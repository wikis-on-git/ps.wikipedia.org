Following invasions from Central Asia between the tenth and twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]]. Mughal emperors gradually expanded their kingdoms to cover large parts of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms, such as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], flourished, especially in the south. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the Mughal supremacy declined and the [[Maratha Empire]] became the dominant power. From the sixteenth century, several [[Europe]]an countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders and later took advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India was under the control of the [[British East India Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/history_freedom_struggle.php|title=History : Indian Freedom Struggle (1857-1947)|accessdate=2007-10-03 |publisher= [[National Informatics Centre|National Informatics Centre (NIC)]] |quote=And by 1856, the British conquest and its authority were firmly established.}}</ref> A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, variously referred to as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] or [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]], seriously challenged British rule but eventually failed.

[[Indian Architecture]], including notable monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of [[Mughal architecture]] and [[South Indian architecture]], is the result of traditions that combined elements from several parts of the country and abroad. [[Indian vernacular architecture|Vernacular architecture]] also displays notable regional variation.

[[Music of India|Indian music]] covers a wide range of traditions and regional styles. [[Indian classical music|Classical music]] is split mainly between the North Indian [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and South Indian [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] traditions.  Highly regionalised forms of popular music include [[filmi music|filmi]] and [[Indian folk music|folk music]]; the syncretic tradition of the ''[[baul]]s'' is a well-known form of the latter.

Among the well-known [[Indian folk dance|folk dances]] are the ''[[bhangra]]'' of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], the ''[[bihu]]'' of [[Assam]], the ''[[Chau|chhau]]'' of [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa]] and the ''[[ghoomar]]'' of [[Rajasthan]].
