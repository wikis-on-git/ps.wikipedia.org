'''د هندوستان جمهوريت''' is a country in [[South Asia]] which comprises of the majority of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres,{{inote|see Indian embassy|i-1}} borders [[پاکستان]] to the west, the [[چين]], [[نيپال]], and [[Bhutan]] to the northeast, and [[بنګله دېش]] او [[ماينامار(برما)|ماينامار]] to the east. On the [[Indian Ocean]], it is adjacent to three [[island nation]]s — the [[Maldives]] to the southwest, [[Sri Lanka]] to the south, او [[اندونېزيا]] to the southeast. India also claims a border with [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest.{{mn|afgh|1}}

The name ''India'' /{{IPA|'ɪndiə}}/ is derived from the [[Old Persian]] version of ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local name for the [[Indus river]] (see [[Origin of India's name]]). The [[Constitution of India]] and common usage also recognise '''Bharat''' ({{lang-hi|भारत}} {{IPA|/bʰɑːrət̪/}} {{Audio|Bharat.ogg|listen}}) as an official name of equal status. This name is derived from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of an ancient [[Hindu]] king, [[Emperor Bharata|Bharata]], whose story can be found in the [[Mahabharata]] [[epic poem]]. A third name, '''[[Hindustan]]''' ({{lang-hi|हिन्दुस्तान}} <!-- THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT. PLEASE READ [[Wikipedia:Enabling complex text support for Indic scripts]] --> /{{IPA|hin̪d̪ust̪ɑːn}}/) {{Audio|Hindustan.ogg|listen}} ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''[[-stan|Land]] of the Hindus'') has been used since the twelfth century, though its contemporary use is unevenly applied due to domestic disputes by some over its representation as a national signifier.

India is the fourth largest economy in the world in terms of [[purchasing power parity]], and the tenth largest in absolute terms. It is the [[List of countries by population| second most populous]] [[country]] in the world, with a [[population]] of over [[1 E9|one billion]], and is the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest]] country by geographical [[area]]. It is home to some of the most [[Indus Valley Civilisation|ancient civilisations]], and a centre of important historic [[Trade route|trade routes]]. Four [[major world religions]]: [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] have Indian origins. Formerly a major part of the [[British Empire]] as the [[British Raj]] before gaining [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947, during the past twenty years the country has grown significantly, especially in its [[Economy of India|economic]] and [[Military of India|military]] spheres, [[Regional power|regionally]] as well as [[Geopolitics|globally]].

==تاريخ==
<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->
{{main|د هندوستان تاريخ}}
[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in present-day India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which began around [[3300 BC]] and peaked between [[2600 BC]] and [[1900 BC]]. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]]. From around [[550 BC]], many independent kingdoms came into being. 

In the north, the [[Mauryan empire|Maurya dynasty]], which included [[Ashoka]], contributed greatly to India's cultural landscape. From [[180 BC]], a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed. This led to the establishment of the [[Indo-Greek]], [[Indo-Scythian]] and [[Indo-Parthian]] kingdoms in the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]], and finally the [[Kushan Empire]]. From the 3rd century AD, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's "Golden Age". 

In the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Kadambas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.

[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BC]]
Following the [[Islamic invasion of India|Islamic invasions]] from Central Asia and Persia in the beginning of the second millennium AD, much of north and central India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal empire|Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign to much of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the relatively sheltered south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].

During mid-second millennium AD, several [[Europe]]an countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], who initially wanted to trade with India, took advantage of the fractured kingdoms fighting each other, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. An 1857 insurrection against the [[British East India Company]] failed, known locally as the [[Sepoy Mutiny|First War of Indian Independence]], and in British and some Western literature as the Indian Mutiny, Sepoy Mutiny or Sepoy Rebellion.  After it was put down, much of India came under the direct administrative control of the crown of the [[British Empire]].

In the early twentieth century, the prolonged, non-violent [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] was led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], widely regarded as the "Father Of The Nation." The struggle culminated on [[1947-08-15]], when India gained full independence from British rule, and became a [[republic]] on [[1950-01-26]].

As a [[ethnic|multi-ethnic]] and multi-religious nation, India has had some sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has stayed together as a vibrant [[democracy]]. It has unresolved border disputes with [[People's Republic of China|China]] (which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962), and with [[Pakistan]], which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil]] (at the northern fringe of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] State).  India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]], making it an unofficial member of the "[[nuclear club]]". This was followed by a series of [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in  in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and added to its global and regional clout. Today India is considered as one of the [[major powers]] and also as one of the [[Superpower#Potential Superpowers|emerging future superpowers]].

India is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialist]], [[secular]], [[democratic]] [[republic]]. India has a quasi-federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has a three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]].

The [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], and has a largely ceremonial role, including interpreting the constitution, signing laws into action and issuing pardons. He is also the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of [[Indian military|India's  armed forces]]. The President and the [[Vice-President of India|Vice President]] are elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is elected by legislators of the political party or [[coalition]] commanding a parliamentary majority, and serves a five-year term. The Constitution does not explicitly provide for a post of Deputy Prime Minister, but this option has been exercised from time to time.

The legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the ''[[Rajya Sabha]]'' (Council of States), and the lower house called the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'' (House of the People). The 245-member ''Rajya Sabha'' is chosen indirectly through an electoral college, and has a staggered six-year term. The 545-member ''Lok Sabha'' is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All Indian citizens above the age of 18 are eligible to vote.

The executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]]), headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature.

India's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts of India. There are eighteen appellate [[High Courts of India|High Courts]], each having jurisdiction over a state or a group of smaller states. Each of these states has a tiered system of lower courts. A conflict between the legislature and the judiciary is referred to the President.

For most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress Party]] (INC). Following its position as the largest political organisation in pre-independence India, the INC, usually led by a member of the [[Nehru]]-[[Indira Gandhi|Gandhi]] family, dominated national politics for over four decades. In 1975, the government led by Indira Gandhi imposed ''[[Indian Emergency|Emergency Rule]]'' across the nation. After emergency was lifted in 1977, and fresh elections were called, a united opposition, under the banner of the [[Janata Party]] won the elections and formed a non-Congress government for a short period. In 1996, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), a [[political party]] with a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist ideology, became the largest single party, and established, for the first time, a serious opposition to the largely left-centered Congress. But power was ''de facto'' held by two successive coalition governments, with the active support of the Congress. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) along with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress government to sustain a full five-year tenure. The decade prior to 1999 was marked by a state of political flux, with seven separate governments formed within that period.

In the [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] the INC returned to power after winning the largest number of seats. It formed a government in alliance with several regional parties, known as the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), with the outside support of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)). The NDA, led by the BJP, currently forms the main opposition. All governments since 1996 have required party coalitions, with no single party claiming a majority, due to the steady rise of regional parties at the national level.

==States and union territories==
{{main|States and territories of India}}

India is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), six [[union territories|Union Territories]] and the [[national capital territory|National Capital Territory]] of [[Delhi]]. States have their own elected government, whereas Union Territories are governed by an administrator appointed by the Union Government, though some have elected governments.

[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]] stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]

India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian Peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].

India is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], which is 1557 miles long, [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic Delta in [[West Bengal]] State.

The Indian [[climate]] varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the north. Parts of India which lie in the Himalayas have a [[tundra]] climate. India gets most of its rains through the [[monsoon]]s.

India's economy ranks tenth in the world in terms of currency conversion (GNP), and fourth in terms of [[Purchasing power parity]] (PPP). It recorded one of the fastest growth rates (8.1%) for the fourth quarter of 2005. Per-capita income (by PPP) is [[USD |US$]] 3100, [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|ranked 125th]] according to the [[World Bank]]. India's [[foreign exchange]] reserves amount to over US$ 145 billion.{{inote|see ecotimes|i-2}} [[Mumbai]] is the financial capital and home to the headquarters of the [[Reserve Bank of India]] and the pre-eminent [[Bombay Stock Exchange]]. While a quarter of Indians still live below the [[poverty line]], a large [[middle class]] has now emerged along with the rapid growth of the [[information technology]] (IT) and [[service industry|service industries]].

The Indian economy has shed much of its historical dependence on [[agriculture]], which now contributes about 21% to GDP.{{inote|see Indian economy|i-3}} Other important industries are [[mining]], [[petroleum]], [[diamond]] polishing, [[film industry|films]], [[textile]]s, IT and [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO) services, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[chemicals]], and [[handicrafts]]. Most of India's industrial regions are centred around major cities. In recent years, India has emerged as one of the largest players in the [[software industry|software]] and BPO industries, with revenues of US$ 17.2 billion in 2004 to 2005.{{inote|software}} Many small-scale industries provide steady employment to workers in small towns and villages.

While India receives only around three million foreign visitors a year, tourism is still an important but under-developed source of national income. Tourism contributes 5.3% of GDP, about US$4 billion in foreign exchange.{{inote|tourism}}. Directly and indirectly, it generates an estimated 42 million jobs, about 10% of India's work force. India's major trading partners are the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[Japan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].{{inote|trade}}

India's main exports include agricultural products, [[textile]] goods, gems and [[jewelry]], software services, engineering goods, chemicals and [[leather]] products, while its main imports are [[crude oil]], machinery, gems, [[fertiliser]], and chemicals. For the year 2004, India's total exports stood at US$ 69.18 billion, imports at US $89.33 billion.{{inote|figure}}

==Demographics== 
{{main|Demographics of India}}
India is the second-most populous country in the world, after China. Language, religion, and [[caste]] are determinants of social and political organisation within the highly diverse population. However, the caste system has been officially illegalized for several decades, and the importance of caste has waned in urban areas.  Furthermore, broad "affirmative action" programs ensure that citizens formerly of the so-called "lower castes" have an advantage in gaining university admittance and government jobs. India's biggest [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] agglomerations are [[Mumbai]] (formerly ''Bombay''), [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]] (formerly ''Calcutta'') and [[Chennai]] (formerly ''Madras'').

India's [[literacy|literacy rate]] is 64.8%, 53.7% for females and 75.3% of males. The sex ratio is 933 females per 1000 males.{{inote|literacy}} [[Work Participation Rate]] (WPR; the percentage of workers to total population) is 39.1%, with male WPR at 51.7% and female WPR at 25.6% {{inote|eu}} India's median age is 24.66, and the population growth rate is 22.32 births per 1,000.{{inote|demostats}}

[[Image:Akshardhamindelhi.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Akshardham]] [[Hindu]] temple, [[Delhi]] ]]
Although 80.5% of the people are [[Hinduism|Hindus]], India is also home to the [[Islam by country|third-largest]] population of [[Muslim]]s in the world (13.4%; see [[Islam in India]]), after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Other religious groups include [[Christianity|Christians]] (2.3%), [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (1.84%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.76%), [[Jainism|Jains]] (0.40%), [[Jew]]s, [[Zoroastrians]], [[Ahmadi|Ahmadi-muslims]], and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s.{{inote|religion}}

India is home to two major [[Languages of India|linguistic families]]: [[Indo-Aryan]] (spoken by about 74% of the population) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (spoken by about 24%). Other languages spoken in India come from the [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] linguistic families. The Indian constitution recognises 23 official languages{{ref|languages}}. [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]] are used by the [[Government of India|Central Government]] for official purposes. Two [[classical languages]] native to the land are [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The number of [[Indian languages|mother tongues]] in India is as high as 1,652.{{inote|tongues}}

==Culture==
{{main articles|[[Arts and Entertainment in India]] and [[Culture of India]]}}
[[Image:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is India's most popular tourist destination.]]

India has a rich and unique cultural heritage, and has managed to preserve its established traditions throughout history. It has always absorbed customs, traditions and ideas from both invaders and immigrants. Many cultural practices, languages, customs and even monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of Islamic-inspired architecture have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country.

Indian society is largely pluralist, multilingual and multicultural. Religious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a [[nuclear family]] system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[complex family|joint family]] system.

Religion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. 
[[Image:gumpa.jpg|thumb|270px|The Gumpa dance is a mystic dance celebrated by the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] community in [[Sikkim]] during the Buddhist New Year &mdash; [[Losar]]]]

A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated by all, irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], and [[Dussehra]], and the Muslim celebration of [[Eid]]. 

[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented in a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are ''[[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]'' from [[South India]], and ''[[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]'' from [[North India]]. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]] and [[Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form (based on the [[itihasa]] (Indian epics), and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. 

The earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these spring from Indian (later called [[Hindu]]) traditions, and are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharatha]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

[[Image:Lunch from Karnataka on a plantain leaf.jpg|thumb|270px|Food in south India is occasionally eaten on a plantain leaf.]]
India produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|films]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in [[Mumbai]], which produces mainly commercial [[Hindi]] films, often referred to as "[[Bollywood]]". Cinema in other vernacular languages is also particularly strong, with movies regularly produced in well-established [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] industries. India's contribution to world cinema was the internationally renowned [[Bengali language|Bengali]] director [[Satyajit Ray]], who in 1992 won an [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement]].

[[Rice]] and [[wheat]] are the staple foods in the country. The [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. The traditional [[sari]] is a popular style of dress for women. Traditional raiments for men is [[dhoti]].

==Sports and games==
{{main|Sports in India}}

India's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game due to its success and popularity in recent times. However, cricket is not the most popular sport in some states, particularly in the North Eastern parts of the country where soccer is favoured more. [[Chess]] is another international sport in which India is quite strong: [[Viswanathan Anand]] was [[FIDE]] World Champion, and several players have made significant inroads in recent years, well past the [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] level. India also has a tradition of cue sports ([[snooker]], [[billiards]], etc) and shooting.

India has had relatively little success in other international events like the [[Olympics]], where it garnered just one silver medal and two bronze medals in the previous three outings. However, it had won eight [[field hockey]] golds until 1980. India has done rather well in [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournaments, reaching the finals on three occasions. Its players have secured several individual titles and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles wins, but an Indian is yet to win a Grand Slam singles.

Traditional indigenous sports include [[polo]], [[kabaddi]], [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country. Chess, [[badminton]] and [[carrom]] are also said to have originated in India. Snooker and badminton have seen Indians achieve some international success. [[Football (soccer)]] is also widely watched in almost the entire country, and is the most popular sport in many states, though India ranks above 100 in the FIFA rankings. [[Formula 1]] racing is also increasing in popularity, due to racing driver [[Narain Karthikeyan]], though its reach is largely limited to urban areas.

==Holidays==
{{main|List of Festivals in India}}

India has three National Holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine to twelve, pertains to festivals, religious holidays and births of leaders which are legislated by the individual states.

==يادښتونه==
*{{mnb|afgh|1}} The Government of India considers the entire state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to be a part of India. This state borders a part of [[Afghanistan]]. A ceasefire sponsored by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 freezes the positions of Indian and Pakistani held territory. As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistani-administered territory.
*{{mnb|LoC|2}} The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.

----
* '''India''' is also the letter '''[[I]]''' in the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]].
