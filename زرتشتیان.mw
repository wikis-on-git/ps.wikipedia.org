'''Zoroastrianism''' is the religion and philosophy based on the teachings ascribed to the prophet [[Zoroaster]] (Zarathustra, Zartosht). '''Mazdaism''' is the religion that acknowledges the divine authority of [[Ahura Mazda]], proclaimed by Zoroaster to be the one uncreated Creator of all (God). 

<!--  This next sentence is there to demonstrate synonymity, not to demonstrate the Fravarānē. -->
As demonstrated by Zoroastrian creed and [[articles of faith]], the two terms are effectively synonymous. In a declaration of the creed — the ''Fravarānē'' — the adherent states: "…I profess myself a devotee of Mazda, a follower of Zarathustra." (''[[Yasna]]'' 12.2, 12.8)

Zoroastrianism was once the dominant religion of much of Western- and Central Asia but as of 2007 practiced only by fewer than 200,000 worldwide,<ref>{{cite web

== Terminology ==
The term "zoroastrianism" was first attested by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 1874 in [[Archibald Sayce|Archibald Sayce's]] ''Principles of Comparative Philology''. The first surviving reference to Zoroaster in Western scholarship is attributed to [[Thomas Browne]] (1605-1682), who briefly refers to the prophet in his 1643 ''[[Religio Medici]]''. The [[OED]] records 1743 (Warburton, ''Pope's Essay'') as the earliest reference to Zoroaster. 

The term 'Mazdaism' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:{{IPA| /'mæz.də.ɪz.m̩/}}) probably derives from ''Mazdayasna'', a compound expression from the [[Avesta]] that combines the last element of the name [[Ahura Mazda]] and the [[Avestan language]] word ''yasna'' meaning 'worship, devotion' (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''yajña'', [[Middle Persian]] ''yasn''). The English word is a typical 19th Century construct, taking "Mazda" and adding the suffix "ism" to suggest a belief-system. The March 2001 draft edition of the ''OED'' notes that an alternate form, 'Mazdeism', perhaps derived from the French ''Mazdéisme'', appeared in 1871. 

In the English language, adherents of the faith refer to themselves as '''Zoroastrians''' or, less commonly, 'Zarathustrians'. Equivalents in other languages include ''Zartoshti'' and ''Mazdayasni''. Additionally, the expression ''Behdini'' ("followers of ''Daena''", for which "Good Religion" is one translation) is prevalent in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]], though in Zoroastrian tradition, ''Behdin'' is the title of an individual who is not of the hereditary occupational class of the priesthood.

* There exists a transcendental and universal God, [[Ahura Mazda]], who is the one uncreated Creator and to whom all worship is directed. With the name being a playful combination of a masculine and a feminine word, it should be stressed that this divinity is not gender specific.
* Creation is attacked by violence and destruction. The resulting conflict involves the entire universe, including humanity, which has an active role to play in the conflict. Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail, at which point time will end. 
* Active participation in life through good thoughts, good words and good deeds are necessary to ensure happiness and to keep the chaos at bay.
* There is a concept of [[free will]], to decide whether to perform good thoughts, words and deeds.

* Not from Zarathushtra's original teachings, but nonetheless accepted by some as doctrine, are:
** Evil is represented by [[Angra Mainyu]] (literally 'destructive spirit'), and good is represented by Spenta Mainyu, the 'good spirit'. In articulating the [[Ahuna Vairya]] formula, Ahura Mazda made his ultimate triumph evident to Angra Mainyu, who then fell back confounded.
** After death, the soul is allowed three days to meditate on his/her past life. If the good thoughts, words and deeds outweigh the bad, then the soul is taken into the light of Ahura Mazda. Otherwise, the soul falls into darkness. The 'darkness' is more similar to the [[Catholic]] doctrine of [[purgatory]] than the [[Christian]] doctrine of [[hell]].
** The universe will go through three eras:
*# creation;
*# the present world where creation is under attack.
*# a final state when Spenta Mainyu will dominate and Ahura Mazda prevail, all the universe will revert to its pure state and the souls trapped in darkness will be released.

* Precepts include:
# equality of all people
# respect, kindness to all living things
# the values of hard work, charity
# loyalty, faithfulness to family, country

== تاريخ ==
Although significantly older, Zoroastrianism only enters recorded history in the mid-5th century BCE. [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' (completed ''c.'' 440 BCE) includes a description of [[Greater Iran]]ian society with what may be recognizably Zoroastrian features, including exposure of the dead. 

Perhaps more importantly, ''The Histories'' is a primary source of information on the early period of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] ([[648 BCE|648]]–[[330 BCE]]), in particular with respect to the role of the [[Magi]]. According to Herodotus i.101, the "Magi" were the sixth tribe of the Medians (until the unification of the Persian empire under [[Cyrus the Great]], all Iranians were referred to as Mede or Mada by the peoples of the Ancient World), who appear to have been the priestly caste of the Mesopotamian-influenced branch of Zoroastrianism today known as "[[Zurvanism]]", and who wielded considerable influence at the courts of the [[Medes|Median]] emperors.

Following the unification of the Median and Persian empires in 550 BCE, [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] and later his son [[Cambyses II]] curtailed the powers of the "Magi" after these had attempted to seed dissent following their loss of influence. In [[522 BCE]], the "Magi" revolted and set up a rival claimant to the throne. The usurper, pretending to be Cyrus' younger son [[Smerdis]], took power shortly thereafter. Owing to the despotic rule of Cambyses and his long absence in Egypt, "the whole people, Persians, Medes and all the other nations," acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years (Herodotus iii. 68).

[[دوتنه:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Behistun Inscription]], carved into a cliffside, gives the same text in three languages, telling the story of [[Darius I of Persia|King Darius']] conquests, with the names of twenty-three provinces subject to him.  It is illustrated by life-sized carved images of King Darius with other figures in attendance.]] 
According to the [[Behistun Inscription]], pseudo-Smerdis ruled for seven months before being overthrown by [[Darius I]] in [[521 BCE]]. The "Magi", though persecuted, continued to exist, and a year following the death of the first pseudo-Smerdis (named Gaumata), had a second pseudo-Smerdis (named Vahyazdāta) attempt a coup. The coup, though initially successful, failed.

Whether Cyrus II was a Zoroastrian is subject to debate. It did however influence him to the extent that it became the non-imposing religion of his empire, and its beliefs would later allow Cyrus to free the Jews from captivity (and allow them to return to [[Judea]]) when the emperor took [[Babylon]] in [[539 BCE]]. Whether Darius I, though certainly a devotee of [[Ahura Mazda]] (as attested to several times in the Behistun inscription), was a follower of Zoroaster has not been conclusively established, since a devotion to Ahura Mazda was (at the time) not necessarily an indication of an adherence to Zoroaster's teaching.

Darius I and later [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid emperors]], though acknowledging their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions, appear to have permitted religions to coexist. Nonetheless, it was during the Achaemenid period that Zoroastrianism gained momentum, and a number of the Zoroastrian texts (that today are part of the greater compendium of the [[Avesta]]) have been attributed to that period.  It was also during the (later) Achaemenid era that many of the divinities and divine concepts of proto-Indo-Iranian religion(s) were incorporated in Zoroastrianism, in particular, those to whom the days of the month of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] are dedicated. That religious calendar, which is still in use today, is itself (to some extent) an Achaemenid-era development.  Those divinities, the ''[[yazata]]''s, are present-day Zoroastrianism's [[angel]]s. (Dhalla, 1938).

Almost nothing is known of the status of Zoroastrianism under the [[Seleucids]] and [[Parthians]] who ruled over Persia following [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] invasion in [[330 BCE]].  According to later Zoroastrian legend (''[[Denkard]]'', ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]''), many of the Zoroastrian sacred texts were lost when Alexander's troops destroyed the royal library at [[Persepolis]] subsequent to the taking of the city. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus Siculus's]] ''Bibliotheca historia'' (completed ''c.'' [[60 BCE]]), which is to a great extent an encapsulation of earlier works, appears to substantiate Zoroastrian legend (Diod. 17.72.2–17.72.6). According to one archaeological examination, the ruins of the palace of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] bear traces of having been subjected to fire (Stolze, 1882). Whether a vast collection of (semi-)religious texts "written on parchment in gold ink" as suggested by the ''Denkard'' actually existed remains a matter of speculation, but is in all likelihood untrue. Given that many of the ''Denkard''s statements-as-fact have since been established as untrue, among scholars, the tale of the library is widely accepted to be a fiction. (Kellens, 2002)

When the [[Sassanid dynasty]] came into power in [[228|228 CE]], they aggressively promoted the Zurvanite form of Zoroastrianism and in some cases persecuted [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]]. When the Sassanids captured territory, they often built fire temples there to promote their religion. The Sassanids were suspicious of Christians not least because of their perceived ties to the Christian [[Roman Empire]]. Thus, those  Christians loyal to the [[List of Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarchate of Babylon]] — which had broken with Roman Christianity when the latter condemned [[Nestorianism]] — were tolerated and even sometimes favored by the Sassanids. Nestorians lived in large numbers in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Khuzestan]] during this period.

A form of Zoroastrianism was apparently also the chief religion of pre-Christian [[Caucasus]] region, or at least was prominent there. During periods of Sassanid suzerainty over the Caucasus, the Sassanids made attempts to promote the religion there as well. 

Well before the 6th century, Zoroastrianism had spread to northern [[China]] via the [[Silk Road]], gaining official status in a number of Chinese states.  Remains of Zoroastrian temples have been found in [[Kaifeng]] and [[Zhenjiang]], and according to some scholars, {{who}} remained as late as the 1130s, but by the 13th century the religion had faded from prominence in China. However, many scholars {{who}} assert the influence of Zoroastrianism (as well as later [[Manicheism]]) on elements of Buddhism, especially in terms of light symbolism.

In the 7th century, the Sassanid dynasty was overthrown by the [[Arabs]]. Although some of the later rulers had Zoroastrian shrines destroyed, generally Zoroastrians were included as [[People of the Book]] and allowed to practice their religion. Mass conversions to Islam were not desired or imposed{{fact}}, in accordance with Islamic law. However, there was a slow but steady movement{{fact}} of the population of Persia toward Islam. The nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert.  Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the dihqans, or landed gentry. Later, the ''jiyza'', a poll tax imposed on non-Muslims, probably accelerated the process.

Many Zoroastrians fled, among them several groups who eventually migrated to the western shores of the Indian subcontinent, where they finally settled. According to the [[Qissa-i Sanjan]] "Story of Sanjan", the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India, the immigrants originated from [[Greater Khorasan|(greater) Khorasan]]. The descendants of those and other settlers, who are today known as the [[Parsi]]s, founded the Indian cities of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]] and [[Navsari]], which are said to have been named after the cities of their origin: [[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]] (near [[Merv]], in present-day [[Turkmenistan]]) and the eponymous [[Sari (city)|Sari]] (in modern [[Mazandaran]], [[Iran]]). (Kotwal, 2004)

In the centuries following the fall of the Sassanid Empire, Zoroastrianism began to gradually return to the form it had had under the Achaemenids, and no evidence of what is today called the "Zurvan Heresy" exists beyond the 10th century CE. (Boyce, 2002) Ironically, it was Zurvanism and Zurvan-influenced texts that first reached the west, leading to the supposition that Zoroastrianism was a religion with two deities: Zurvan and Ahura Mazda (the latter being opposed by [[Angra Mainyu]]).

Today, the number of Zoroastrians is significantly lower than it once was, but the religion is alive and dynamic.  Over the centuries, adherents of the faith have dispersed in all directions, but greater concentrations of Zoroastrians may still be found on the [[Indian subcontinent]] and in Iran.

Zoroastrianism is uniquely important in the history of religion because of its possible formative links to both Western [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and Eastern [[dharmic religions|dharmic]] religious traditions.

Some scholars (Boyce, 1987; Black and Rowley, 1987; Duchesne-Guillemin, 1988) assert that key concepts of [[Zoroastrian eschatology]] and [[demonology]] are evident in the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, for instance in the  [[Asmodai]] of Judaism. However, Boyce and other Iranologists also tell us that Zoroastrianism inherited ideas from other belief systems. As such, Zoroastrianism, like all other ''practiced'' religions, revealed or otherwise, was not immune to [[syncretism]]. For example, one of the popular strains within Zoroastrianism considers both good and evil as ''creations'' of God. This is a doctrine influenced by Christianity (see [[Ahura Mazda]] for details), and notwithstanding the great deal of exposition in order to not compromise Zoroaster's otherwise coherent concept of [[Free Will]], has a widespread following.

Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced back to the culture and beliefs of the proto-Indo-Iranian period, and Zoroastrianism consequently shares some elements with the [[historical Vedic religion]] that also has its origins in that era. However, Zoroastrianism was also strongly affected by the later culture of the Iranian [[Heroic Age (literary theory)|Heroic Age]] (1500 BC onwards), an influence that the Indic religions were not subject to. Nonetheless, scholars have used evidence from the texts of both religious systems to reconstruct the earlier stage of [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] beliefs and culture. This has also formed attempts to characterise the even earlier [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and so, for example, determine the process by which [[Dyeus]] became [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], [[Sabazios]], [[Zeus]], and [[Tyr]].

Many aspects of Zoroastrianism are in turn present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of the [[Greater Iran]], not least because Zoroastrianism, for a thousand years, was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]]-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs   but also because [[Ferdowsi]] incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the [[Avesta]] in his epic ''[[Shahnameh|Shāhnāme]]'', which in turn is pivotal to Iranian identity.

{{main|Avesta}}
==== Primary texts ====
The [[Avesta]] is the collection of the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. Although some of the texts are very old, the compendium as we know it today is essentially the result of a [[redaction]] that is thought to have occurred during the reign of [[Shapur II of Persia|Shapur II]] ([[309]]-[[379|379 CE]]). However, important sections of the text have been lost since then, especially after the fall of the [[Persian empire]], after which Zoroastrianism was supplanted by [[Islam]]. The oldest existing copy of the texts dates to [[1288|1288 CE]].

The most ancient of the texts of the Avesta are in an old or ''Gathic'' [[Avestan language]] and are believed to have been transmitted orally for centuries before they found written form. Later texts date from between the [[8th century BCE]] to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] ([[648 BCE|648]]–[[330 BCE]]) and are in ''Original'' Young Avestan and ''Artificial'' Young Avestan respectively. In existing copies of the text, the Avestan language words are written in ''[[Avestan alphabet|Din dabireh]]'' script, a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid era]] ([[226]]-[[651|651 CE]]) invention.

[[دوتنه:Bodleian_J2_fol_175_Y_28_1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Yasna 28.1, ''Ahunavaita [[Gathas|Gatha]]'' (Bodleian MS J2)]]
The contents of the Avesta are generally divided into five categories. The divisions are topical and are by no means fixed or canonical. Some scholars prefer to place the five categories in two groups, one liturgical and the other general.
* The ''Yasna'', the primary liturgical collection and comprising of 72 chapters: Yasna 1 to Yasna 72; includes the ''[[Gathas]]'', (yasnas 28 to 34, the Ahunavaity Gatha; yasnas 43 to 46, the Ushtavaity Gatha; yasnas 47 to 50, the Spenta Mainyu Gatha; yasna 51, the Vohuxsathra Gatha; and yasna 53, the Vahishta Isti Gatha), which are thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself.
* The ''Visparad'', a collection of supplements to the ''Yasna''.
* The ''Yashts'', hymns in honor of the divinities of [[Zoroastrian angelology]].
* The ''Vendidād'', describes the various forms of evil spirits and ways to confound them.
* shorter texts and prayers, the five ''nyaishes'' "worship, praise", the ''siroze'' "thirty days" (see [[Zoroastrian calendar]]) and the ''afringan''s "blessings".

==== Secondary works ====
The texts of the Avesta are complemented by several secondary works of religious or semi-religious nature, which although not sacred and not used as scripture, have a significant influence on Zoroastrian doctrine.
* The ''[[Denkard|Dēnkard]]'' "Acts of Religion" in Middle Persian
* The ''[[Bundahishn]]'' "Original Creation" in Middle Persian
* The ''[[Mēnog-ī Khirad]]'' "Spirit of Wisdom" in Middle Persian
* The ''[[Arda Wiraf Nāmag]]'' "The Book of Arda Viraf" in Middle Persian
* The ''[[Zartoshtnāme]]'' "Book of Zoroaster" in Modern Persian
* The ''[[Saddar]]'' "Hundred Doors or Chapters" in Modern Persian
* The ''Rivayat''s or traditional treatises in Modern Persian
Some of these works quote passages that are believed to be from lost sections of the Avesta.

==== Other texts ====
Two other collections of texts are considered a part of the Zoroastrian literary canon. The following were intended for general use by the laity:
* The ''Khordeh Avesta'', a collection of everyday prayers from the [[Avesta]].
: The prayers of the ''Khorda Avesta'' are in Avestan, which continues to be the Zoroastrian language of prayer even today. The most sacred of these prayers is the ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' (also known as the ''yatha ahu vairyo''), which has been interpreted to be the summation of the belief in [[Ahura Mazda]], "the seed of seeds of the reckoning of the religion." (''Dēnkard'' 8.45.1)
* ''Zend'' (lit: commentaries) fragments.
: The use of the expression ''Zend-Avesta'' to refer to the Avesta, or the use of ''Zend'' as the name of a language or script, are relatively recent and popular mistakes. The word ''Zend'' or ''Zand'', meaning "commentary, translation", refers to late [[middle Persian]] and [[Pazend language|Pazend]] language supplementaries in [[Pahlavi script]]. These commentaries from the early [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] era were not intended for use as theological texts by themselves but for religious instruction of the (by then) non-Avestan-speaking public. In contrast, the texts of the Avesta proper remained sacrosanct and continued to be recited in Avestan - which was considered a [[sacred language]]. In a general sense, the secondary texts mentioned above are also included in the ''Zend'' rubric since they too often include commentaries on the [[Avesta]] and on the religion.

[[دوتنه:Faravahar.png|thumb|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a ''Fravashi'' (guardian spirit)|230px|right]]
[[Ahura Mazda]] is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything which can and cannot be seen, the Eternal, the Pure and the only Truth. In the [[Gathas]], the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism and thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, the prophet acknowledged devotion to no other divinity besides Ahura Mazda.

''Daena'' (''din'' in modern [[Persian language|Persian]]) is the eternal Law, whose order was revealed to humanity through the ''Mathra-Spenta'' 'Holy Words'. ''Daena'' has been used to mean religion, faith, law, even as a translation for the Hindu and Buddhist term [[Dharma]], religious duty, but which can also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue. The metaphor of the 'path' of ''Daena'' is represented in Zoroastrianism by the muslin undershirt ''Sudra'', the 'Good/Holy Path', and the 72-thread ''Kusti'' girdle, the 'Pathfinder'.

''Daena'' should not be confused with the fundamental principle ''[[asha]]'' (Vedic ''rta''), the equitable law of the universe, which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, ''asha'' was the course of everything observable, the motion of the planets and astral bodies, the progression of the seasons, the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset. All physical creation (''geti'') was thus determined to run according to a master plan - inherent to Ahura Mazda - and violations of the order (''druj'') were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda. This concept of ''asha'' versus the ''druj'' should not be confused with the good-versus-evil battle evident in western religions, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the ''asha'' versus ''druj'' concept is more subtle and nuanced, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or 'uncreation', evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply 'the lie' (that opposes truth, righteousness). Moreover, in His role as the one uncreated Creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of 'druj' which is 'nothing', anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated. Thus, in Zoroaster's revelation, Ahura Mazda was perceived to be the creator of only the good (Yasna 31.4), the "supreme benevolent providence" (Yasna 43.11), that will ultimately triumph (Yasna 48.1)

In this schema of ''asha'' versus ''druj'', mortal beings (humans and animals both) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict and it is their ''duty'' to defend order, which would decay without counter''action''. Throughout the [[Gathas]], Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions<!-- this is dealt with in the next para-->; and accordingly asceticism is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism. In later Zoroastrianism, this was explained as fleeing from the experiences of life, which was the very purpose that the ''urvan'' (most commonly translated as the 'soul') was sent into the mortal world to collect. The avoidance of any aspect of life, which includes the avoidance of the pleasures of life, is a shirking of the responsibility and duty to oneself, one's ''urvan'', and one's family and social obligations.

Thus, central to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose between the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of ''druj''. Similarly, [[predestination]] is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act to one another. Reward, punishment, happiness and grief all depend on how individuals live their life. 

In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds. Those who do evil have themselves to blame for their ruin. Zoroastrian morality is then to be summed up in the simple phrase, "good thoughts, good words, good deeds" (''Humata'', ''Hukhta'', ''Hvarshta'' in [[Avestan]]), for it is through these that ''asha'' is maintained and ''druj'' is kept in check. 

Through accumulation, several other beliefs were introduced to the religion, that in some instances supersede those expressed in the Gathas. In the late 19th century, the moral and immoral forces came to be represented by ''Spenta Mainyu'' and its Satanic [[antithesis]] ''[[Angra Mainyu]]'', the 'good spirit' and 'evil spirit' emanations of Ahura Mazda respectively. Although the names are old, this opposition is a modern western-influenced development popularized by [[Martin Haug]] in the 1880s, and was in effect a realignment of the precepts of [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), which had invented a ''third'' deity, ''Zurvan'', in order to explain a mention of twinship (''Yasna'' 30.3) between the moral and immoral. Although Zurvanism had died out by the 10th century, the critical question of the "twin brothers" mentioned in ''Yasna'' 30.3 remained, and Haug's explanation provided a convenient  defence against Christian missionaries who disparaged the [[Parsi]]s (Indian Zoroastrians) for their 'dualism'. Haug's concept was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug's theory and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine. 

[[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid era]] (648–330 BCE) Zoroastrianism developed the abstract concepts of heaven, hell, personal and final judgement, all of which are only alluded to in the [[Gathas]]. ''Yasna'' 19 (which has only survived in a [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid era]] (226–650 CE) ''Zend'' commentary on the ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' invocation), prescribes a Path to Judgement known as the ''Chinvat Peretum'' or ''Chinvat Bridge'' (''cf:'' [[Al-Sirat]] in Islam), which all souls had to cross, and judgement (over thoughts, words, deeds performed during a lifetime) was passed as they were doing so. However, the Zoroastrian personal judgement is not final. At the end of time, when evil is finally defeated, all souls will be ultimately reunited with their [[Fravashi]]. Thus, Zoroastrianism can be said to be a universalist religion with respect to salvation.

In addition, and strongly influenced by Babylonian and Akkadian practices, the Achaemenids popularized shrines and temples, hitherto alien forms of worship. In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of [[Mithra]], [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], [[Vahram|Verethregna]] and [[Tishtrya]], all of which, in addition to their original (proto-)Indo-Iranian functions, now also received Perso-Babylonian functions. 

Although the worship of images would eventually fall out of favour (and be replaced by the iconoclastic [[fire temple]]s), the lasting legacy of the Achaemenids was a vast, complex hierarchy of [[Yazata|''Yazata''s]] (modern Zoroastrianism's Angels) that were now not just evident in the religion, but firmly established, not least because the divinities received dedications in the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], thus ensuring that they were frequently invoked. Additionally, the [[Amesha Spenta]], the six originally abstract terms that were regarded as direct emanations or aspects or 'divine sparks' of Ahura Mazda, came to be personified as an archangel retinue. 

Some Zoroastrians believe in the future coming of a [[Messiah]]-like figure known as the [[Peshotan]]. This too is a modern syncretic development, and is frowned upon by more conservative Zoroastrians.

== Zoroastrian precepts ==
[[دوتنه:Ateshkadeh yazd.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Zoroastrian temple of Yazd.]]
Some major Zoroastrian precepts:
* [[Equalism]]: Equality of all, irrespective of [[Gender Egalitarianism|gender]], race, or religion.
* Respect and kindness towards all living things. Condemnation of the oppression of human beings, cruelty against animals and sacrifice of animals.
* [[Environmentalism]]: Nature is central to the practice of Zoroastrianism and many important Zoroastrian annual festivals are in celebration of nature: new year on the first day of spring, the water festival in summer, the autumn festival at the end of the season, and the mid-winter fire festival.
* Hard work and charity: Laziness and sloth are frowned upon. Zoroastrians are encouraged to part with a little of what would otherwise be their own.
* Loyalty and faithfulness to "family, settlement, tribe, and country."

== Other distinguishing characteristics ==
* The symbol of fire: The energy of the creator is represented in Zoroastrianism by fire and the sun which are both enduring, radiant, pure and life sustaining. Zoroastrians usually pray in front of some form of fire (or any source of light). (It is important to note that fire is not worshipped by Zoroastrians, but is used simply as symbol and a point of focus, much like the crucifix in Christianity. For details, see [[Fire temple]])
* Proselytizing and conversion: Parsi Zoroastrians do not [[proselytism|proselytize]]. In recent years, however, Zoroastrian communities in both Iran, Europe and the Americas have been more tolerant towards conversion. While this move has not been supported officially by the priesthood in Mumbai, India, it has been endorsed by the Council of Mobeds in Tehran.
* Inter-faith marriages: As in many other faiths, Zoroastrians are strongly encouraged to marry others of the same faith, but this is not a requirement of the religion itself.
** Some members of the Indian Zoroastrian community (the [[Parsi]]s) contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of gender equality, and may be a remnant of an old legal definition (since overruled) of Parsi. However, to this day, some priests will not perform the Navjote ceremony - i.e. the rites of admission into the religion - for children of mixed-marriages, irrespective of which parent is a non-Parsi. This issue is a matter of great debate within the Parsi community, but with the increasingly global nature of modern society and the dwindling number of Zoroastrians, such opinions are less vociferous than they previously were.
** In Iran, due to continuing discrimination against non-Muslims, inter-faith marriage is not encouraged by the government.
* Death and burial: Religious rituals related to death are all concerned with the person's soul and not the body. Zoroastrians believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Traditionally, Zoroastrians disposed of their dead by leaving them atop open-topped enclosures, called [[Towers of Silence]], or ''Dokhmas''. Vultures and the weather would clean the flesh off the bones, which were then placed into an [[ossuary]] at the center of the Tower. Fire and Earth were considered too sacred for the dead to be placed in them. While this practice is continued in India by some Parsis, it had ended by the beginning of the twentieth century in Iran. In India, burial and cremation are becoming increasingly popular alternatives.

== Adherents ==
Small Zoroastrian communities are found in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], as well as major urban areas in [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and a worldwide diaspora. Zoroastrian communities comprise two main groups of people: those of Indian Zoroastrian background, who are known as [[Parsis]] (or Parsees), and those of Iranian background.

==== In Iran ====
{{main article|Zoroastrians in Iran}}

Communities exist in Tehran, as well as in [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]], where many still speak an Iranian language distinct from [[Persian language|Persian]]. They call their language [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] (not to be confused with the [[Dari (of Afghanistan)|Dari of Afghanistan]]). Their language is also called ''Gabri'' or ''Behdinan'' (literally "Of the Good Religion"). Sometimes their language is named for the cities in which it is spoken, ''Yazdi'' or ''Kermani''. Iranian Zoroastrians were historically derogatorily called ''Gabar'' (roughly translated as 'infidel') by Muslim neighbours. The term is still used but has lost much of its derogatory meaning.

==== In India ====
[[دوتنه:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Parsi]] ''Navjote'' ceremony (rites of admission into the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith)]]
:''Main article: [[Parsi]]s, the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent.''

Subsequent to the fall of the [[Persian Empire]], after which Zoroastrianism was gradually supplanted by Islam, many Zoroastrians fled to other regions in the hope of preserving their religious tradition. Among them were several groups who migrated to [[Gujarat]], on the western shores of the [[Indian subcontinent]], where they finally settled. The descendants of those refugees are today known as the [[Parsi]]s.<!--The year of arrival on the subcontinent cannot be precisely established and Parsi legend and tradition assigns various dates (936 CE, 765 CE and 716 CE) to the event.-->

In contrast to their co-religionists elsewhere, in India the Zoroastrians enjoyed tolerance and even admiration from other religious communities. From the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society, partly due to the divisive strategy of [[British Empire|British colonialism]] which favored certain minorities. As such, Parsis are generally more affluent than other Indians and are stereotypically viewed as among the most Anglicised and "Westernised" of Indian minority groups. They have also played an instrumental role in the economic development of the country over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the [[Tata]], [[Godrej]], and [[Wadia]] families.

As of the census of 2001, the Parsis numbered 69,601, representing approximately 0.006% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of [[Mumbai]] (previously known as Bombay). Due to a low birth rate and high rate of emigration, demographic trends project that by the year 2020 the Parsis will number only about 23,000 or 0.002% of the total population of India. The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labelled a 'tribe'.

==== In Central Asia ====
There is some interest among Iranians, as well as people in various Central Asian countries such as [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]], in their ancient Zoroastrian heritage; some people in these countries take notice of their Zoroastrian past. In fact, [[UNESCO]] (at the instigation of the government of [[Tajikistan]]) declared 2003 a year to celebrate the "3000th Anniversary of Zoroastrian Culture," with special events throughout the world.

==== Demographics ====
In 1996, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated to be "at most 200,000" (Melton, 1996:837). India's 2001 Census found 69,601 [[Parsi]] Zoroastrians. In [[Pakistan]] they number 5000, mostly living in [[Karachi]]. North America is thought to be home to 18,000–25,000 Zoroastrians of both [[Parsi]] and Iranian background. [[Iran|Iran's]] figures of Zoroastrians have ranged widely; the last census (1974) before the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution of 1979]] revealed 21,400 Zoroastrians. 

Few (if any) adherents remain in the [[Central Asia]]n regions that were once considered the traditional stronghold of Zoroastrianism, i.e. [[Bactria]] (see also [[Balkh]]), [[Sogdiana]], [[Margiana]], and other areas closest to Zoroaster's homeland.<!-- homeland/area definition see Boyce, 1975:chap 1. For "closest to Zoroaster's homeland", see Boyce's theory why Mazdaism survived but Zurvanism did not 1957:308-309 -->
