'''Pervez Musharraf''' ({{lang-ur| پرويز مشرف}}); born [[August 11]], [[1943]] ([[Delhi]], [[British India|India]]) is the head of government of [[Pakistan]]. He took power on October 12, 1999 after a  [[coup d'état]] and assumed the title of [[president of Pakistan]] on June 20, 2001, succeeding [[Rafiq Tarar]].
==Family background==
Musharraf's parents came from a middle class background and both were college-educated. His mother, Begum Zehra Musharraf,  majored in [[English Literature]]. She worked for the [[International Labour Organisation]] (ILO) and retired in 1986. Syed Musharraf-ud-Din, Musharraf's father, was a graduate of [[Aligarh University]] in India. He joined Pakistan's Foreign Service in a clerical position and progressed in his career, retiring as a Section Officer in the Foreign Ministry. He spent several years in the capacity of support staff in the Pakistan Embassy in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]] where Musharraf spent part of his childhood and learned to speak fluent [[Turkish language|Turkish]].
Musharraf was born in [[Daryaganj]] in [[Delhi]], India and after the [[independence of Pakistan]], in [[1947]], his family settled in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. General Pervez Musharraf is married to Begum [[Sehba Musharraf]] and has two children. His brother is a medical doctor in [[Chicago]].

==Education==
Musharraf attended [[Saint Patrick's High School, Karachi]] graduating in 1958 before going on to attend [[Forman Christian College]] in Lahore.

===Military training===
In 1961, he joined the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] at [[Kakul]]. A graduate of Command and Staff College, Quetta, and the National Defense College, Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf also studied at the [[Royal College of Defence Studies]], [[United Kingdom]].

===Military career===
Musharraf participated in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] as a [[Company (military unit)|Company]] [[Commander]] in the [[Special Services Group|SSG]] Commando [[Battalion]]. He had the responsibility of commanding [[artillery]] [[regiment]]s and an armored [[division (military)|division]]. In September 1987, heading a newly formed SSG [[Mountain warfare]] unit at Khapalu base (Kashmir) he launched an assault to capture the Indian held posts of Bilafond La [[mountain pass|pass]] in the [[Siachen Glacier]] but was eventually beaten back. [http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&issue_id=3101&article_id=2368659] On promotion to the rank of [[Major General]] on [[January 15]], [[1991]], he was given the command of an [[Division_(military)#Infantry|Infantry Division]] and later of a  Strike [[Corps]] as [[Lieutenant General]] on [[October 21]], [[1995]]. Musharraf was promoted to Army Chief in 1998, when General [[Jehangir Karamat]], resigned. In 1999, he led the Pakistan Army during the famous [[Kargil War]].

==Coup d'état and election==
[[Image:Musharaff addressing nation.jpeg|right|300px]]
===Coup d'état===
Musharraf became ''[[de facto]]'' [[Head of Government]] (using the title ''Chief Executive'' and assuming extensive powers) of [[Pakistan]] following a bloodless [[coup d'état]] on [[12 October]], [[1999]]. That day, Sharif attempted to dismiss Musharraf and install [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] director Khwaja Ziauddin in his place. Musharraf, who was out of the country, boarded a commercial airliner to return to Pakistan. Senior Army generals refused to accept Musharraf's dismissal. Sharif ordered the Karachi airport to prevent  the landing of the airliner, which then circled the skies over Karachi. In a [[coup d'état|coup]], the generals ousted Sharif's administration and took over the airport. The plane landed with only a few minutes of fuel to spare, and Musharraf assumed control of the government. Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was put under house arrest and later exiled. He and other democratic leaders have even been prevented from entering Pakistan. The existing [[President of Pakistan]], [[Rafiq Tarar]], remained in office until June 2001. Musharraf formally made himself President on [[June 20]], [[2001]], just days before his scheduled visit to [[Agra]] for talks with India.

==Referendum held: Supreme Court orders elections==
Shortly after Musharraf's takeover, several people filed court petitions challenging his assumption of power. On [[May 12]], [[2000]], the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ordered Musharraf to hold general elections by [[October 12]], [[2002]]. In an attempt to legitimize his presidency and assure its continuance after the approaching restoration of democracy, he held a [[referendum]] on [[April 30]], [[2002]] to extend his presidential term to five years after the October elections. However, the referendum was [[boycott]]ed by the majority of Pakistani political groupings, which later complained that the elections were heavily [[Rigged election|rigged]], and [[voter turnout]] was 30% or below by most estimates. A few weeks later, Musharraf went on TV and apologized to the nation for "irregularities" in the the referendum.

Musharraf also forcibly removed many of the Supreme Court Justices who had voted against his usurpation of power. These included Justice Taqi Usmani, a world authority on International financial law and Consitutional law. Newspaper editors who were critical of Musharraf, such as the ediotr of the Balochistan Post, have also been exiled.

General elections were held in October, 2002 and a [[plurality]] of the seats in the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] were won by the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML-Q]], a pro-Musharraf party consiting of feudallandlords whose power and hold on politics Musharraf had promised to destroy. However, parties opposed to Musharraf effectively paralyzed the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] for over a year. The deadlock ended in December 2003, when Musharraf made a deal with the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] party, an alliance of islamist radicals with known links to [[Bin Laden]] agreeing to leave the army by [[December 31]], [[2004]]. He subsequently refused to keep his promise. With that party's support, pro-Musharraf legislators were able to muster the two-thirds [[supermajority]] required to pass the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Seventeenth Amendment]], which retroactively legalized Musharraf's 1999 coup and many of his decrees.

==Electoral College victory==
In a [[vote of confidence]] on [[January 1]] [[2004]], Musharraf won 658 out of 1,170 votes in the [[Electoral College of Pakistan]], and according to Article 41(8) of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], was "deemed to be elected" to the office of President until October 2007.

==After [[September 11]] [[2001]]==

===Support for the War on Terror===
Following the [[September 11]], [[2001]] terrorist attacks in the United States, Musharraf sided with the United States against the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Musharraf agreed to give the United States the use of three airbases for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. Secretary of State Colin Powell and other administration officials met with Musharraf. Musharraf's reversal of policy and help to the U.S. military was critical in the U.S. bombing that rapidly overcame the Taliban regime.

===Tensions with India===
On [[December 13]], [[2001]], a group of terrorists
attacked India's Parliament with bombs and guns. India, blaming Pakistan for the attack, mobilized for a potential war. Musharraf rejected as preposterous the claim that Pakistan had anything to do with the attacks.

Intense pressure from Washington followed. The Washington Post (Jim Hoagland, [[January 17]]) said that "the United States extracted promises from
Gen. Musharraf that Pakistan's intelligence service and army will
cease giving food, weapons and other logistical help to infiltrators
who carry out terrorist raids into India and Indian Kashmir. The army will no longer provide mortar fire to cover the terrorists, who have been cut adrift by Musharraf."

===Denouncing extremism===
On [[January 12]], [[2002]], Musharraf gave a landmark speech against Islamic extremism.
Musharraf unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism, including those carried out in the
name of freeing Kashmir's Muslim majority from Indian rule.  He also
pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan
itself.

==Dual-office controversy==

A pro-Musharraf party, the [[PML-Q]], won a [[plurality]] in the elections of October 2002, and formed a majority coalition with independents and allies such as the [[MQM]]. Nevertheless, the opposition parties effectively deadlocked the National Assembly, refusing to accept the legitimacy of Musharraf's authority. In December 2003, as part of a compromise with the main Islamist opposition group, the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], an alliance of islamist radicals including the Jammat Islami whose leaders have known links to [[Bin Laden]], General Musharraf said he would step down as Army Chief by [[January 1]] [[2005]]. He again did not honour his promise. In return, the MMA agreed to support a constitutional amendment that would retroactively legalize Musharraf's coup, and restore some formal [[checks and balances]] to Pakistan's system of government.

In late 2004, however, pro-Musharraf legislators passed a bill allowing Musharraf to keep both offices, and Musharraf announced that he intended to hold on to both.

==Views and perceptions of Musharraf==
===Image of a moderate leader===

==Musharraf's views considered relatively liberal==
Musharraf was raised in a family that is considered liberal by Pakistani standards. The women of the family are unsequestered and seen and photographed in public without veils. His mother worked for the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] and was friends with well-known Pakistani liberals. His daughter is an architect.

Shortly after coming to power, and on numerous occasions afterwards, Musharraf expressed admiration for the secularist reformer of [[Turkey]], [[Kemal Atatürk]], outraging religious radicals in the country. However in Parliament he in alliance with the [[Majil Amal]] an Islamist alliance whose leaders still publicly support the Taliban regime.

At the same time, the conduct and procedure of national elections in Pakistan has been criticised by Human Rights groups within Pakistan, including the world renowned human rights activist, [[Asma Jehangir]].

==Partner in the [[War on Terror]]==
[[Image:Mushbush.jpg|thumb|300px|Musharraf with [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]]]]

Since his involvement as a senior officer of Pakistan's special forces during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], Musharraf has had excellent personal relations with several sections of the US security establishment. 

It is widely believed that Musharraf was coerced by the United States into turning his back on his former allies-the Taliban government of Afghanistan. Certainly his speeches on national television expressed his belief that he 'had no choice' but to act in unison with the United States.

Musharraf's support for the [[United States|USA]] was indispensable in defeating the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] with the ease that it was routed. This was done after his swift and strategically sound decision to cease Pakistan's long-running support of the Taliban. Pakistan cut the Taliban's oil and supply lines, provided intelligence and acted as a logistics support area for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. It has also allowed US forces to operate inside Pakistan and Pakistani forces especially the military controlled Inter Services Agency have been implicated in the use of torture on suspected militants. Musharraf has also launched a major military offensive in the tribal region of Wana, displacing many resident families in the hunt for terrorists and has caused a national insurgency movement made up of disaffected militants and former residents of Wana whose homes were demolished by the army in its heavy bombing campaign.

Musharraf speaks fluent English and has given many interviews and speeches on various US and European TV channels and other media. He is also known for giving contrasting views in his interviews. He has spoken at [[think tank|think tanks]] such as the [[RAND|RAND Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], in [[June 2003]]. His support for the US-led War on Terror has been a cause for dislike by some right-wing Islamic fundamentalist parties in Pakistan. The US's image in Pakistan has suffered ostensibly after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war]] in [[Iraq]] without a [[UN]] resolution. Musharraf has bluntly refused to send any Pakistani troops to Iraq without a UN resolution.


==Assassination attempts==

On [[December 14]], [[2003]], General Musharraf survived an [[assassin]]ation attempt when a powerful bomb went off minutes after his highly-guarded [[convoy]] crossed a bridge in [[Rawalpindi]]. It was the third such attempt during his four-year rule. 11 days later, on [[December 25]], 2003, two [[Suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] tried to assassinate Musharraf, but their [[car bomb]]s failed to kill the president; 16 others nearby died instead. Musharraf escaped with only a cracked windshield on his car. It has been reported that [[Amjad Hussain Farooqi]] is suspected of being the mastermind behind these attempts, and there was an extensive manhunt for him, ending with Farooqi's death.

==Elections during Musharraf's administration==
On [[12 May]] [[2000]], the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ordered Musharraf to hold national elections by [[12 October]] [[2002]], Elections for local governments took place in 2001. Elections for the national and provincial legislatures were held in October 2002, with no party winning a majority. In [[November 2002]], Musharraf handed over certain powers to the newly elected [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. The [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] elected [[Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], who in turn appointed his own cabinet.
[[Image:Musharraf5.jpg|thumb|300px|President Musharraf talks to the world press]]

On [[January 1]], [[2004]] Musharraf won a [[confidence vote]] in the [[Electoral College of Pakistan]], consisting of both houses of [[Parliament]] and the four provincial assemblies which are dominated by the landed elite of the country, most of whom have been given governmental posts under Musharraf. Musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes, a 56% majority, but many opposition and [[Islam]]ic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote. As a result of this vote, according to Article 41(8) of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], Musharraf was "deemed to be elected" to the office of President. His term now extends to 2007. 

Prime Minister Jamali resigned on [[26 June]] [[2004]], and in his place the National Assembly elected [[Shaukat Aziz]], a former Vice President of [[Citibank]] and head of ''Citibank Private Banking''. The new government was mostly supportive of Musharraf, who remained President and Head of State in the new government. Musharraf continues to be the active executive of Pakistan, especially in foreign affairs.

==Nuclear proliferation==

Recently, Musharraf has come under fire in the West after the disclosure of [[nuclear proliferation]] by Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], the [[metallurgy|metallurgist]] known as the father of Pakistan's bomb. Musharraf has denied knowledge of or participation by Pakistan's government or army in this proliferation despite deep domestic criticism for singularly vilifying Khan, a national hero. Musharraf continues to enjoy strong support of the [[White House]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense| Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. AQ Khan has been pardoned in exchange for cooperation in the investigation of his nuclear-proliferation network. The fate of those who were found to have conspired with Khan is yet to be decided.

[[Image:mushvaj.jpg|thumb|300px|Musharraf with [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]], former [[Prime Minister of India]]]]

==Peace overtures with [[India]]==
Musharraf was Chief of Army Staff at the time of Pakistani incursions into the Indian-held disputed territory of [[Kashmir]] ([[Kargil]] sector), in the summer of 1999. After suffering many reverses, the Pakistani Army was ordered to retreat resulting in a defeat. Some reports suggest that Musharraf retreated after huge pressure on the then Pakistani Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] from the American President, who feared the conflict could turn into a nuclear catastrophe. However in a recent book co authored by ex-[[CENTCOM]] Commander in Chief, [[Anthony Zinni]] and [[Tom Clancy]], the former alleges that Musharraf was the one who pushed Sharif to withdraw the Pakistani troops after being caught in a losing scenario.{{ref|Book}} According to an ex-official of the Musharraf government, Hassan Abbas, it was Musharraf who planned the whole operative and sold the idea to Sharif. {{ref|Book2}} The view that Musharraf wanted to attempt the Kargil infiltrations much earlier was also revealed by Former Pakistani PM [[Benazir Bhutto]] in an interview to a leading [[Newspaper|daily]], where he had supposedly boasted that "he would hoist the [[Flag of Pakistan]] atop the [[Srinagar]] Assembly" if his plan was executed {{ref|Bhutto}} As the Kargil incident came just after the [[Lahore Declaration|Lahore Peace Summit]] earlier that year, Musharraf was viewed with mistrust in India.

In the middle of 2004, Musharraf began a series of talks with India to solve the [[Kashmir]] dispute. Both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have the tactical capability to launch nuclear strikes on every single city within each others' borders. The two countries are continuing to aggressively increase their nuclear capabilities by actively producing even more nuclear weapons and perfecting their missile technologies by routinely conducting tests of ever more sophisticated missiles.

Pakistan has publicly stated that it reserves the right to 'exercise its nuclear option' in a large scale war with India. On the other hand India has a 'no first nuclear strike' policy enshrined in its nuclear doctrine. In response Musharraf has instead offered a "no war pact" to India, which India has refused.

==Recent developments==

Musharraf gave an interview to the Washington post in which he said Pakistani women who were the victims of rape treated rape as a moeny making concern and were only intersted in publicity. He subsequently denied making these comments. The Washington Post has made available an audio recording of the interview in which Musharraf can be heard makign these remarks. It can be found here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/audio/2005/09/23/AU2005092301253.html. 

 He denied Mukhtaran Mai, a Pakistani rape victim, the right to travel abroad until pressured to do so. He has also refused to go after the rapists of Dr Shazia, a senior military officer who was allegedly raped by relatives of Musharraf's peers in the army.

Another testing time for his government was a massive earthquake that raked havoc mainly in northern Pakistan. The government has been widely criticised by people both home and abroad for the lack of preparation, however it united people from across Pakistan with government in providing post quake relief. The relief efforts are continuing and so far $5.9 billion has been pledged by the international community, a combination of grants and loans. Of the grants, as of [[29 December]] [[2005]] only about $80 million of a pledged $2.3 billion has materialised. However the quake still did not prove successful to bridge the widening gap between government and opposition parties who still tried to use this catastrophe for hostile criticism of each other. In the meantime, extremist [[jihadi]] groups operating in Pakistan have secured a footing in these areas by offering much needed aid which the government did not deliver.
