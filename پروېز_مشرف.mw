In 1961, he entered the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] at [[Kakul]], graduated 11th in his class and was commissioned in 1964 in the Artillery [[Regiment]] (16(SP) Self Propelled artillery unit now based in Bahawalpur,PK). Later he joined Special Services Group and then was posted to Field Artillery Regiments.

====د هند او پاکستان جګړه====
Musharraf participated in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] as the 2nd [[Lieutenant]] in the 16 (SP) Field Artillery Regiment. His regiment saw action as part of the First Armoured Division’s offensive in the [[Khemkaran]] sector, where a major offensive was planned against the Indian Army.<ref name="Memoirs" /> Despite possessing a quantitative advantage and significant superiority in armor,<ref>[http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/india/assaluttar.html The Battle of Assal Uttar: Pakistan and India 1965]</ref> the 1st armoured division (labelled "pride of the Pakistan Army") suffered a crushing defeat and Khemkaran became known as a graveyard of Pakistan tanks.<ref>[http://www.pakdef.info/pakmilitary/army/tanks/patton.html PakDef.Info]</ref>. By all accounts the vital advance failed at the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]], as Pakistan lost a golden opportunity to make major strategic gains, and was a turning point in the war.<ref>Musharraf’s fiery memoirs By Anwar Kemal, [[Dawn (newspaper)]] October 14, 2006</ref> His regiment was later moved to the Lahore front{{Fact|date=May 2007}} which was seriously threatened by the Indian Army. Later on it was sent to take part in the major battles around Chawinda.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

Later, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] he served as a [[Company (military unit)|Company]] [[Commander]] in the [[Special Service Group|SSG]] Commando [[Battalion]]. Originally scheduled to be flown to [[East Pakistan]] along with other SSG troops, he was redeployed in Punjab as war broke out and all flights over India were cancelled. He later admitted that he "broke down and wept"<ref name="Memoirs" /> when he heard the "disgusting" news of Pakistan's unconditional surrender to India.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060425/asp/nation/story_6142205.asp Musharraf’s 1971, a sob story], [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1502245,prtpage-1.cms Musharraf 'wept' when East Pak fell]</ref> Later he commanded Regiments of Artillery, there after an [[Artillery Brigade]] and then went on to command an [[Division (military)|Infantry Division]]. In September 1987, heading a newly formed SSG at Khapalu base (Kashmir), he launched an unsuccessful assault to capture the Indian held posts of [[Bilafond La]] in [[Siachen Glacier]].<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&issue_id=3101&article_id=2368659 Jamestown Foundation]</ref>

On promotion to the rank of Major General on [[January 15]], [[1991]], he was assigned the command of an Infantry Division. Later, on promotion to Lieutenant General on [[October 21]], [[1995]] he took over command of 1 Corps,the elite strike Corps. In 1998, following the resignation of General Jehangir Karamat, he was personally promoted over other senior officers by Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], as an obedient General and took over as the Chief of Army Staff.

====Role in Kargil Conflict====
{{main|Kargil War}}
From May to July 1999, Pakistan and India were involved in the [[Kargil Conflict]], an armed conflict between the two countries in the Kargil district of [[Kashmir]]. It was planned and executed during General Musharraf's term as Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff under Prime Minister Sharif. The conflict sparked tensions between civic and military branches of government and, ultimately triggered P.M. Sharif's decision to dismiss General Musharraf.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Ex-[[CENTCOM]] Commander [[Anthony Zinni]], and P.M. Sharif, have stated that Musharraf requested that the Prime Minister withdraw Pakistani troops from Kashmir.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Tom Clancy]], Gen. Tony Zinni (Retd) and Tony Koltz | title=Battle Ready | publisher=Grosset & Dunlap | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-399-15176-1}}</ref> Sharif has claimed that Musharraf was solely responsible for the Kargil attacks.<ref>[http://www.weeklyvoice.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1443&Itemid=66 Musharraf Vs.

However, his role in planning the Kargil attacks has been universally criticized by several independent reports for showing "a shocking lack of strategy."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/kashmir/Story/0,2763,726763,00.html

==ولسمشري (2001 - )==
====پوځي کودتا====
{{main|1999 Pakistani coup d'état}}
Musharraf became ''[[de facto]]'' [[Head of Government]] (using the title ''Chief Executive'' and assuming extensive powers) of [[Pakistan]] following a bloodless [[coup d'état]] on [[12 October]] [[1999]]. That day, the constitutional Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] attempted to dismiss Musharraf and install [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) Director Khwaja Ziauddin in his place. Musharraf, who was out of the country, boarded a commercial airliner to return to Pakistan. Senior Army Generals refused to accept Musharraf's dismissal, which was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Sharif ordered the Karachi airport closed to prevent the landing of the airliner, which then circled the skies over Karachi. In the coup, the Generals ousted Sharif's administration and took over the airport. The plane landed with allegedly only a few minutes of fuel to spare, and Musharraf assumed control of the government. Sharif was put under house arrest and later exiled. He and other leaders have subsequently been prevented from entering Pakistan. Reportedly, the disagreement between Musharraf and Sharif centered around the Prime Minister's desire to find a diplomatic resolution to the conflict with India in the [[Kashmir region]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472997.stm BBC profile on Musharraf]</ref>

The existing [[President of Pakistan]], [[Rafiq Tarar]], remained in office until June 2001. Musharraf formally appointed himself President on [[June 20]], [[2001]], just days before his scheduled visit to [[Agra]] for talks with India.

====د ولسمشرۍ ټاکنې====
Shortly after Musharraf's takeover, several people filed court petitions challenging his assumption of power. However he got [[The Oath of Judges Order 2000]] issued. It required the judges to take a fresh oath of office swearing allegiance to military rule. Judges must swear that they will make no decisions against the military rule. Many judges refused and resigned in protest. Subsequently on [[May 12]], [[2000]], the Supreme Court of Pakistan now filled which judges of the General's pleasing and who had now taken oath not to take any decisions against the Military Junta, ordered Musharraf to hold general elections by [[October 12]], [[2002]]. In an attempt to legitimize his presidency and assure its continuance after the approaching restoration of democracy, he held a [[referendum]] on [[April 30]], 2002 to extend his presidential term to five years after the October elections. However, the referendum was [[boycott]]ed by the majority of Pakistani political groupings, which later complained that the elections were heavily [[Rigged election|rigged]], and [[voter turnout]] was 30% or below by most estimates. A few weeks later, Musharraf went on TV and apologized to the nation for "irregularities" in the referendum.
 
General elections were held in October 2002 and a [[plurality]] of the seats in the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] was won by the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML-Q]], a pro-Musharraf party. However, parties opposed to Musharraf effectively paralysed the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] for over a year. 

The deadlock ended in December 2003, when Musharraf made a deal with the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] party, a six-member coalition of Islamic parties, agreeing to leave the army by [[December 31]], [[2004]]. He subsequently refused to keep his promise. With that party's support, pro-Musharraf legislators were able to muster the two-thirds [[supermajority]] required to pass the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Seventeenth Amendment]], which retroactively legalized Musharraf's 1999 coup and many of his decrees.

In an interview in March 2007, Musharraf said that he intends to stay in the office for another five years. The leader of the pro-Musharraf party has also said that Musharraf would be re-elected from the current assemblies and not after the 2007 elections.
<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C03%5C11%5Cstory_11-3-2007_pg7_1 Daily Times - Musharraf tells why he wants another five years]</ref>
<ref>[http://paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?171641 Current assembles to reelect Musharraf]</ref>

====Electoral College vote====
In a [[vote of confidence]] on [[January 1]], 2004, Musharraf won 658 out of 1,170 votes in the [[Electoral College of Pakistan]], and according to Article 41(8) of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], was "deemed to be elected" to the office of President until October 2007.

====Assassination attempts====
On [[December 14]], [[2003]], General Musharraf survived an [[assassination]] attempt when a powerful bomb went off minutes after his highly-guarded [[convoy]] crossed a bridge in [[Rawalpindi]]. Musharraf was apparently saved by a jamming device in his limousine that prevented the remote controlled explosives from blowing up the bridge as his convoy passed over it. It was the third such attempt during his four-year rule. Eleven days later, on [[December 25]], 2003, two [[Suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] tried to assassinate General Musharraf, but their [[car bomb]]s failed to kill the president; 16 others nearby died instead. Musharraf escaped with only a cracked windscreen on his car. Militant [[Amjad Farooqi]] was apparently suspected as being the mastermind behind these attempts, and was killed by Pakistani forces in 2004 after an extensive manhunt. On July 6, 2007, there was another attempted assassination, when an unknown group fired an anti-aircraft gun at Musharraf's plane as it took off from a runway in Rawalpindi.<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/world/458232,pakistan070607.article Shots fired at Musharraf's plane in apparent assassination attempt July 6, 2007] Chicago Sun Tribune</ref> 39 people were arrested, detained and put at an undisclosed location by a joint team of Punjab Police and Pakistan Intelligence Agencies. <ref>{{cite news

===Domestic issues===
====Elections during Musharraf's administration====
On [[12 May]] [[2000]], the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] ordered Musharraf to hold national elections by [[12 October]] [[2002]]; elections for local governments took place in 2001. Elections for the national and provincial legislatures were held in October 2002, with no party winning a majority. In November 2002, Musharraf handed over certain powers to the newly elected [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. The [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] elected [[Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], who in turn appointed his own cabinet.

On [[January 1]], [[2004]] Musharraf won a [[confidence vote]] in the [[Electoral College of Pakistan]], consisting of both houses of Parliament and the four provincial assemblies which are dominated by the landed elite of the country, most of whom have been given governmental posts under Musharraf. Musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes, a 56% majority, but many opposition and [[Islam]]ic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote. As a result of this vote, according to Article 41(8) of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], Musharraf was "deemed to be elected" to the office of President. His term now extends to 2007. 

Prime Minister [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali|Jamali]] was resigned on [[26 June]] 2004, after losing the support of party, the [[PML-Q]]. His resignation was at least partly due to his public differences with the party chairman [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]], and was rumored to have happened at the command of General Pervez Musharraf, although neither man has confirmed this. Jamali had been appointed with the support of Musharraf's and the pro-Musharraf PML(Q). Most PML(Q) parliamentarians formerly belonged to the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] party led by Nawaz Sharif, and most ministers of the cabinet were formerly senior members of other parties, joining the PML(Q) after the elections upon being offered powerful offices. It is believed that Musharraf replaced Jamali due to his poor performance and in his place Musharraf nominated [[Shaukat Aziz]], the minister for finance and a former Joint President of [[Citibank]]<ref>[http://financialeducation.citigroup.com/citigroup/press/1998/data/981013a.htm Citigroup: Global Consumer Business Announces Management Structure]</ref> and head of ''Citibank Private Banking'' as the new prime minister. The talk of Jamali leaving were around days before Jamali went but it was denied as rumour by politicians and even Jamali himself. Musharraf choose Shaukat Aziz due to his successful measures in revitalizing Pakistan's economy as the Finance Minister. The new government is mostly supportive of Musharraf, who remains the President and Head of State in the new government. Musharraf continues to be the active executive of Pakistan, especially in foreign affairs. Although whether he stays the president after he gives up the post of Chief of Army staff is still to be seen.

==== Dual-office controversy ====
A pro-Musharraf party, the [[PML-Q]], won a plurality in the elections of October 2002, and formed a majority coalition with independents and allies such as the [[MQM]]. Nevertheless, the opposition parties effectively deadlocked the National Assembly, refusing to accept the legitimacy of Musharraf's authority. In December 2003, as part of a compromise with the main Islamist opposition group, the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], an alliance of Islamic parties, General Musharraf said he would step down as Army Chief by [[January 1]], [[2005]]. In return, the MMA agreed to support a constitutional amendment that would retroactively legalize Musharraf's coup, and restore some formal [[checks and balances]] to Pakistan's system of government. In late 2004, Musharraf went back on his agreement with the MMA and pro-Musharraf legislators in the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] passed a bill allowing Musharraf to keep both offices.

==== Economy ====
{{Citations missing|section|date=June 2007}}
At the time Musharraf took over the government, Pakistan was regarded as a failed state by many international experts, as it was close to bankrupt. Total foreign exchange reserves were less than one month's import. Investor confidence was at an all-time low. 

The economic reforms by the Musharraf government totally reversed the situation; now the economy is one of the fastest growing [[Economy of Asia|economies in Asia]]. Pakistan foreign exchange reserves now exceed $15 billion, as against less than $1 billion when he took office. The foreign investment in Pakistan in the first 9 months of the 2006-2007 financial year have exceeded $5.0 billion. Per capita income of Pakistan in current dollars has more then doubled in the last 7 years and expected to exceed $1000 by 2008. 

The country's economic growth is now fueled by consumption and export-based growth strategy, and is based on the core-periphery model, focusing on large cities to generate spill over effects in their surrounding areas. In the beginning an expansionary policy was implemented and construction was boosted to support other industries. Doing business is much easier than previous governments and the economy is one of the, if not the most, [[liberal economy|liberal]] in the region. To fuel economic growth, a strategy to reverse [[brain drain]] was initiated, and the percentage of [[GDP]] spent on education was doubled. Investor confidence was built by officials making world tours and meeting business people around the world. The rate of [[privitisation]] was also increased.

Silent progressive revolution in Pakistan is building up as the economy is booming, jobs are being created, trillions of rupees are being spent on huge projects like [[Gwadar port]]. Gwadar port is expected to become transit point for middle eastern oil to [[China]], and more importantly, for transportation of goods from western China to the rest of the world, effectively making Gwadar China's western sea [[port]]. Gwadar is also expected to become a port city that would serve Central Asian countries  for their international trade with outside world, including their export of oil and gas.

====Corruption====
When Musharraf came to power, he claimed that the rampant corruption in the government bureaucracy would be cleaned up.<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1777889.stm BBC]</ref>.  However, although Musharraf stated that a crackdown on corruption would be initiated, many neutral analysts have noted that, even years into his administration, his regime is letting the corrupt go free.<ref name="BBC" />. 

Critics of his administration point to the fact that Pakistan, which was placed at 79 in the ranking of corruption-free countries five years back<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001]</ref> is now ranked at 142<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2006]</ref>, indicating that, according to the Transparency International's list, Pakistan is now one of the most corrupt nations in the world. However a sizeable number of educated individuals are of the view that the high levels of corruption existing previously are gradually subsiding due to rapid economic growth, better renumeration packages for government employees, free press/media and the massive privatization of services sector.

According to a survey by [[Transparency International]], Pakistani public opinion perceives Musharraf's regime as more corrupt than the previous democratic governments led by [[Benazir Bhutto]] and Mr. Sharif.<ref>[http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C09%5C25%5Cstory_25-9-2006_pg3_1 EDITORIAL: Disinformation International?] September 25, 2006, [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]</ref><ref>[http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=323649&sid=SAS&ssid=]</ref>  

There have also been allegations that corrupt [[servicemen]] aren't being prosecuted because of the [[Military Junta|junta's]] clout.<ref>[http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/0505/nat.pakistan.html Bogged Down By Endless Troubles by AYAZ GUL Islamabad] - [[Asiaweek]]</ref> Pakistani media too have alleged that individual corruption of the previous government was replaced by institutionalised corruption of the Pakistan Army, awarding land deeds and a life of luxury to its officers.<ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=29009 George Orwell and Musharraf's book By Aisha Fayyazi Sarwari] November 03, 2006 [[The News]]</ref>. However the government defends it position by terming this as an "incentive" for servicemen to work with dedication, terming land deeds as a no-profit/no-loss investment: members have to pay a compensation for the land throughout their years of service on a monthly basis prior to being alloted land (of equal worth)upon their retirement.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The military terms this policy as an ethically correct practice of rewarding it's members for their services.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

====Suspension and reinstatement of Chief Justice Chaudhry====
{{Current|section|date=June 2007}}
On March 9, 2007, General Pervez Musharraf suspended the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]]. In an interview about the matter given to [[Geo TV]], Musharraf stated that Chaudhry himself wished to meet with him and Musharraf then presented him with evidence related to charges made against Chaudhry for abuse of office. <ref>[http://www.zshare.net/video/1322797bd9d95c/ Video of interview with Geo TV.</ref> Other sources maintain that Chaudhry was summoned by the General at his Army residence in Rawalpindi and asked to explain his position on a list of charges brought against him from several quarters. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6442829.stm Judge row prompts Pakistan democracy questions], BBC, Monday, 12 March 2007, 17:47 GMT.</ref> Chaudhry was demanded to resign, but he refused and was detained. While this was not confirmed by the Affidavit presented by him in Supreme Court, While affidavits by other people in same case has said that it was not true and He(Chief Justice) Has asked to meet the President and was not asked to resign. Meanwhile, another senior judge, Justice [[Javaid Iqbal]], was appointed as the acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Musharraf's moves sparked protests among Pakistani lawyers. On 12 March 2007, lawyers across Pakistan began boycotting all court procedures in protest against the suspension. In the capital Islamabad, and in other cities such as Lahore, Karachi and Quetta, hundreds of lawyers dressed in black suits attended rallies, condemning the suspension as unconstitutional. More than twenty lawyers were injured in clashes with police during the demonstrations in Lahore.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} On 16 March, demonstrations became more widespread, and included protesters outside the legal community.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Slowly the expressions of support for the ousted Chief Justice gathered momentum and by May, protesters and opposition parties took out huge rallies against Musharraf and his tenure as army chief was also challenged in the courts.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/15/top10.htm Musharraf’s tenure as army chief challenged] Dawn </ref><ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C05%5C14%5Cstory_14-5-2007_pg3_1 EDITORIAL: Musharraf’s political options are closing] [[Daily Times]]</ref>
Rallies held by the MQM and other political parties left more than 40 people dead in firefights in the streets of Karachi, and the offices of AAJ TV were caught in the crossfire and sustained damage. Opposition parties have accused the government and Rangers of not doing enough to stop the violence.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Pakistan's Supreme Court on 20 July reinstated Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.  It also dismissed misconduct charges that Musharraf filed against him. <ref>Kamran Haider, "Court reinstates Pakistan judge in blow to Musharraf" "The Star" [of Malaysia] July 20, 2007 http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/20/worldupdates/2007-07-20T193211Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-285778-3&sec=Worldupdates</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therealnews.com/web/index.php?thisdataswitch=0&thisid=346&thisview=item |title=The Real News - Pakistan Supreme Court reinstates chief justice |accessdate=2007-07-21 |format= |work=}}</ref>

====Lal Masjid and its Aftermath====

The standoff between the Pakistani government and the clerics of the [[Lal Masjid]] in Islamabad finally came to a boil on the morning of 8 July 2007 when the official government delegation led by the [[Shujaat Hussain]], declared that the negotiations with the militants holed up in the mosque had failed.

The militants have also held back several hundred students, many of who are young girls using them as human shields. The militants appeared to be well armed. 

After the negotiations failed the troops were given the go ahead to storm the complex. Codenamed ‘[[Operation Silence]]’ the objective of the operation is to capture or kill the militants if they resist. The additional burden of rescuing all the hostage students being used as a human shield by the militants.  

The Lal Masjid issue had put President Musharraf in a tough spot. The battle lines had clearly been drawn and reflected the social strife that plagues Pakistani society today. If one is to be honest this is a fight between secular and fundamental forces in Pakistan. It is a fight between radical extremism and moderation. It is a fight between fundamentalist Pakistan and modern Pakistan. This incident, seemingly localized, reflects the greater struggle that Pakistani society has recently been witnessing. The Lal Masjid issue is only the tip of the iceberg. The entire fate of the Pakistani society hangs in the balance; will Pakistan plunge into the darkness of religious fundamentalism or will the moderate voices prevail?

It is difficult to say who has the upper hand in this social struggle. But for the time being it seems that the moderate forces do have a chance given that the man at the helm is a moderate himself. It was a difficult decision that President Musharraf made when he ordered his troops to storm the Lal Masjid. It was a decision he would rather not have made but was forced to do so. It had become simply unavoidable. What is significant is that President Musharraf who has probably the toughest job in the world in terms of doing a balancing act between placating the hawkish forces within his country and yet maintaining a largely secular outlook, was put on the hot-seat with the Lal Masjid issue. He had to choose and it is heartening to see that he chose to crack down on extremism. However, his decision wasn’t entirely motivated by secular fervor as opposed to cold calculation.

====The National Security Estimate 2007 and the Threat of US Attack on Pakistan ====
President Bush’s top counterterrorism advisers acknowledged on the 17 July 2007  that the strategy for fighting Osama bin Laden’s Al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan had failed. This assessment was released in a new intelligence assessment that requires that more aggressive measures be taken in Pakistan. 

The intelligence report said that terrorist threats facing the [[United States]], concludes that the United States was losing ground on a number of fronts in the fight against [[Al Qaeda]]. 
The report stated that the main reasons for Al Qaeda’s resurgence, was due to the hands-off approach toward the tribal areas by Pakistan’s president, Gen. [[Pervez Musharraf]], who last year brokered a cease-fire with tribal leaders in an attempt to drain support for [[Islamic extremism ]]in the region. 

As a result the US government stated that it may  consider military force if necessary to stem al-Qaida's growing ability to use its hideout in Pakistan to launch terrorist attacks. The President's  Bush homeland security adviser,[[Frances Fragos Townsend]], said the US was committed first and foremost to working with Pakistan's President, General Pervez Musharraf, in his efforts to control militants in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region. But she indicated the US was ready to take additional measures. ''Just because we don't speak about things publicly doesn't mean we're not doing things you talk about,'' Townsend said, when asked in an interview why the US does not conduct special operations and other measures to cripple al-Qaeda. ''Job No 1 is to protect the American people. Incidents like this there are growring concern In the US government that Musharaff is getting unpopular and there are voices in US government that the president Musharaff has to leave the political arena.As a prelude to the use of force [[CNN]] has released a  documentary by [[Nic Robertson]] titled [[Pakistan; The Threat Within]]. The documentary highlights the brewing threat of military action against the [[United States]] and  [[NATO]] forces in [[Afghanistan]].

Democratic presidential candidate Sen.[[ Barack Obama]], in a major foreign policy address, stated that is an attack on Pakistan was required he would be willing to do so. 

The instability of the satiation was further highlighted in the [[International Crisis Group]] report on Pakistan titled [[ Elections, Democracy and Stability In Pakistan]] released on the internet on [[31 July 2007]] that is the country did not have a free and fair elections without military intervention the crisis in Pakistan would further increase and increase the tendency of a US attack on Pakistani soil. The report also suggested to the US government that [[the Generals]] must be given incentives to relinquish power and is these incentives don't work then the US government should impose sanctions to coerce the government towards a peaceful transition towards democracy. .<ref>[ http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4969&l=1]</ref>

====Relations with India====
{{Main|Kargil War}}{{weasel|section}}
Musharraf was Chief of Army Staff at the time of [[Mujahideen]] incursions into India from [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] in the summer of 1999. Although Pakistan claimed that these were Kashmiri freedom fighters, later developments showed that they were Pakistani paramilitary soldiers backing up the separatists on the mountain top. After fierce fighting, Pakistani soldiers were pulled back due to pressure from the international community. Some reports suggest that Musharraf retreated after huge pressure from the former Pakistani Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] from the American President [[Bill Clinton]], who feared the conflict could turn into a nuclear catastrophe.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
<!--[[Image:mushvaj.jpg|thumb|250px|Musharraf with [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]], former [[Prime Minister of India]] at the Agra Summit during 2001]]-->

However, in ''[[Battle Ready]]'', a book co-authored by ex-[[CENTCOM]] Commander in Chief [[Anthony Zinni]] and novelist [[Tom Clancy]], the former alleges that Musharraf was the one who pushed Sharif to withdraw the Pakistani troops after being caught in a losing scenario.<ref>{{cite book | author=Tom Clancy, Gen. Tony Zinni (Retd) and Tony Koltz | title=Battle Ready | publisher=Grosset & Dunlap | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-399-15176-1}}</ref> According to an ex-official of the Musharraf government, Hassan Abbas, it was Musharraf who planned the whole operative and sold the idea to Nawaz Sharif.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hassan Abbas | title=Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, the Army, and America's War on Terror | publisher=M.E.

On [[December 13]], [[2001]], a group of militants attacked [[Parliament of India|India's Parliament]] with bombs and guns. India, who blamed Pakistan for the attack, mobilized for a potential war. Musharraf denied any Pakistani involvement with the attacks. Nonetheless, the United States began to apply diplomatic pressure following the incident. On [[January 17]], the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (Jim Hoagland, [[January 17]]) reported that "the United States extracted promises from Gen. Musharraf that Pakistan's intelligence service and army will cease giving food, weapons and other logistical help to infiltrators who carry out raids into India and [[Indian Occupied Kashmir|Indian-controlled Kashmir]]. The army will no longer provide mortar fire to cover the militants, who have been cut adrift by Musharraf".

In the middle of 2004, Musharraf began a series of talks with India to solve the [[Kashmir dispute]]. As well as discussing the Kashmir dispute, both leaders discussed the following issues: Wullar Barrage and Kishangaga power project, [[Baglihar Dam]] on the [[Chenab]] River being built by India in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], Disputed [[Sir Creek]] estuary at the mouth of the [[Rann of Kutch]], [[Siachin glacier]], Issues of [[Gurdaspur]] and [[Ferozepur]]'s status, Hindu-Muslim Relations, [[Autonomy]] for the [[Sikhs]] in Indian [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Minority group|Minority]] rights, Indian contentions that Pakistan is sponsoring "cross-border" terrorism.

====Support for the War on Terror====
[[Image:BUSHPERVEZ.jpg|thumb|200px|right|President Musharraf and President Bush during a press conference in the White House]]

The two discussed a number of issues, including [[emergency management|earthquake recovery]] and continued [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence cooperation]].
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the [[United States]], Musharraf sided with the United States against the [[Taliban]] government in [[Afghanistan]] after an ultimatum by the United States. Musharraf agreed to give the United States the use of three airbases for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other administration officials met with Musharraf. Musharraf's reversal of policy and help to the U.S. military was necessary in the U.S. bombing that rapidly overcame the Taliban regime. On [[September 19]], [[2001]], Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated while he supported the

====Richard Armitage comments controversy====
[[Image:C 074329582X.jpg|thumb|Cover of the UK edition of ''In the Line of Fire: A Memoir'']]
During a September 24, 2006 interview with [[CBS News]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'' program (interviewed by [[Steve Kroft]]), Musharraf described how then-U.S. Deputy Secretary of State [[Richard Armitage]] had called Musharraf's intelligence director shortly following the September 11, 2001 attacks and threatened military action if Pakistan did not support the U.S.-led War on Terror. According to Musharraf, Armitage warned: "Be prepared to be bombed. Be prepared to go back to the [[Stone Age]]"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5369198.stm US 'threatened to bomb' Pakistan] [[BBC]], [[22 September]], [[2006]]</ref> Furthermore, during an interview with [[Jon Stewart]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on September 26, 2006, Musharraf stated that then-Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] also contacted him with a similar message: "You are with us or against us." Musharraf refused to elaborate further, citing the then-upcoming release of his book, ''[[In the Line of Fire: A Memoir]]'' (ISBN 0-7432-8344-9). Armitage has denied that the U.S. used such harsh words to threaten Pakistan whereas President Bush has refrained from publicly acknowledging the possibility of the exact wordings being used. However, according to the press statement he said that "I was taken aback".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Nuclear proliferation ==
One of the most widely-reported controversies during Musharraf's administration arose as a consequence of the disclosure of [[nuclear proliferation]] by Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], the [[metallurgy|metallurgist]] known as the father of Pakistan's bomb. Musharraf has denied knowledge of or participation by Pakistan's government or army in this proliferation and has faced bitter domestic criticism for singularly vilifying Khan, a former national hero. Musharraf continues to enjoy the strong support of the [[White House]] and former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. AQ Khan has been pardoned in exchange for cooperation in the investigation of his nuclear-proliferation network. However, he is still under house arrest, and is likely to remain so till the end of his days. The fate of those who were found to have conspired with Khan is yet to be decided.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4965566.stm Pakistan nuclear case 'is closed']</ref> 

==Denouncing extremism==
On [[January 12]], [[2002]], Musharraf gave a landmark speech against [[Islamic extremism]]. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism, including those carried out in the name of freeing Kashmir's Muslim majority from Indian rule. He also pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself.

He has also used it to ban funding of [[madrasa]]s and [[mosque]]s from outside the country.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} At the same time as banning foreign funding of Islamic educational institutions, he made it compulsory for them to teach a whole host of additional subjects such as computing. This meant that many had to close due to the halt of funds from Pakistanis working abroad resulting in not being able to teach the additional subjects that he had made compulsory. Musharraf also instituted prohibitions on foreign students' access to studying Islam within Pakistan, an effort which began as an outright ban but was later reduced to restrictions on obtaining visas.

Various think tanks in the United States are of the opinion that Musharraf supports the Taliban and is using the United States just to get funding.  He has fully backed the Islamic Parties and just as his predecessor Army Dictators derives his power from the Mullahs.

==Views of Musharraf==
{{Refimprovesect|date=June 2007}}
Pervez Musharraf has been viewed as a moderate leader, with comparatively liberal and progressive ideas. He has made attempts of economic and social reforms to modernize [[Pakistan]]. He has also expressed admiration for the secular reformer [[Kemal Ataturk]] of Turkey, outraging religious anti-secularists in the country.  Musharraf's policy is often seen as a secularist counterpart to militant Islamo-Facism. Subsequently, Musharraf enjoys support from a sizeable (albeit silent) educated and moderate majority of Pakistan. Under his rule the economy has progressed by multiple factors grossing over $140 Billion worth of GDP from the previous meagre $70 Billion whereas the per capita income has more than doubled. Furthermore, his policies regarding the freedom of press and media have resulted in the mushrooming of a large number of independent TV channels and has empowered the media to a scale never before witnessed in the history of Pakistan. Despite being a military ruler, majority of Pakistanis credit him with empowering a fundamental pillar of democracy: Pakistans media is now regarded as one of the most independent in the region. Musharraf is also regarded as being surprisingly pro-democracy by giving unprecedented freedom to the opposition, by allowing open politics to thrive and empowering people with politics at the grassroots level. According to majority of the educated population, this coupled with the free press would play a crucial role towards creating true democracy even after Musharraf has left power. On a personal level, Musharraf is admired widely for his supreme confidence and the ability to show initiative.
Conversely, he has expressed admiration for right-wing General [[Rahimuddin Khan]], the [[authoritarian]] [[martial law administrator]] of Balochistan throughout the [[1980s]]. It has been alleged by some analysts in the United States that Musharraf has secretly supported the Taliban and the Islamists. His remarks on rape have been highly controversial.  During a tape-recorded, 50-minute interview with the Washington Post, Musharraf said that claiming rape has become a "moneymaking concern" in Pakistan on September 23, 2005. Musharraf later denied saying this to the Post. Here is a recording of the quote in the 12th paragraph of the Sept. 12 story. The remark was made in regards to the case of Mukhtar Mai, an illiterate woman who spoke publicly about having been gang-raped on the orders of a village council in 2002.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/audio/2005/09/23/AU2005092301278.html]
