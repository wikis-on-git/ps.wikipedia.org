'''مغولستان''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: Монгол Улс) is a [[landlocked]] [[country]] located in [[East Asia]].  Mongolia is also sometimes classified as being a part of [[Central Asia]], depending on the definition used.  It is bordered by [[روسيه]] to the north and the [[چين]] to the south.  Its [[capital]] and largest city is [[Ulaanbaatar]].

Mongolia was the center of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the [[13th century]] and was later ruled by [[China]] during the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]] from the end of the [[18th century]] until 1921, when an independent [[government]] was formed with [[Soviet]] assistance. Following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1989, and after the fall of [[communism]] in Mongolia in 1990, Mongolia adopted [[democracy]] via [[electoral politics|elections]].  A new, democratic constitution which was ratified in 1992 officially marked the birth of Mongolia as a democratic country, making it one of the world's youngest democracies. 

At 1,564,116 [[square]] [[km]], Mongolia is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|18th largest]] country in the world. However, the country contains very little [[arable land]] as much of its area is covered by arid and unproductive [[steppes]] with mountains to the north and west and the [[Gobi Desert]] to the south. With a population of little more than 2.8 [[million]], approximately 30 percent of the country's people are [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic.  The predominant religion in Mongolia is [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and the majority of the state's citizens are of the [[Mongol]] [[ethnicity]], though many [[Kazakhs]] and [[Tuvans]] also live in the country, especially in the west. About one-third of the population lives in [[Ulaanbaatar]].

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د مغولستان تاريخ}}
A large number of ethnicities have inhabited Mongolia since prehistoric times. Most of these people were nomads who from time to time formed great confederations that rose to prominence. The first of these, the [[Xiongnu]], were brought together to form a confederation by [[Modu Shanyu]] in [[209 BC]]. They defeated the [[Donghu]], who had previously possessed the [[hegemony]] in eastern Mongolia. The [[Xiongnu]] became the greatest enemy of [[China]] for the following three centuries. The [[Great Wall of China]] was built partly as defence against the [[Xiongnu]]. The Marshal [[Meng Tian]] of the [[Qin Empire]] dispersed more than 300,000 soldiers along the [[Great Wall]] to prevent an expected invasion from the North. It is believed that after their decisive defeat by the Chinese in [[428]]-[[431]], some of the [[Xiongnu]] migrated West to become the [[Huns]]. After the [[Xiongnu]] migrated west, [[Rouran]], a close relative of the [[Mongols]], came to power before being defeated by the [[Gokturks]], who then dominated Mongolia for centuries.

=== Early history ===
[[دوتنه:Premongol.png|thumb|left|220px|[[Eurasia]], circa 1200 CE.]]
During the 7th and 8th centuries, Mongolia was controlled by [[Gokturks]], who were succeeded by the [[ancestors]] of today's [[Uigur]]  and then by the [[Khitan]] and [[Jurchen]]. By the [[10th century]], the country was populated predominantly by [[Mongols]] believed to be a branch of the [[Xianbei]]. During this period the country was divided into numerous [[tribe]]s linked through transient alliances. [[دوتنه:Mongol_Empireaccuratefinal.png|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mongol Empire]] at its greatest extent.]]
In the late 12th Century, a chieftain named [[Temujin]] united the Mongol tribes to the [[Naiman]] and [[Jurchen]] after a long struggle. Starting in 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] and his successors consolidated and expanded the [[Mongol Empire]] into the largest contiguous land [[empire]] in world history. After Ghengis Khan's death, the empire was divided into four kingdoms, or "Khanates." One of these, the "Great Khanate," comprised the Mongol homeland and [[China]], and its emperors were known as the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Its founder, [[Kublai Khan]], set up his centre of administration in present day [[Beijing]]. After more than a century of power, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] was replaced by the [[Ming Dynasty]] in [[1368]]. The Mongol court fled north. The Ming armies pursued and defeated them in Mongolia, but did not conquer Mongolia.

During the next few centuries, Mongolia was split between the [[Oirad]] in the west and the [[Khalkha]] in the east. [[Altan Khan]] united the Mongols briefly in [[1571]]. After failing to defeat the Chinese, he made peace with the [[Ming Dynasty]] and instead attacked [[Tibet]], eventually becoming a convert to [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

During the 17th Century, the [[Manchus]] rose to prominence in the east, and they conquered [[Inner Mongolia]] in 1636 and [[Outer Mongolia]] in 1691. For the next 200 years Mongolia was ruled by the [[Manchus]], whose rulers became the [[Qing Dynasty]]. During this time, the Manchus maintained their control over Mongolia with a series of alliances and intermarriages, as well as military and economic control. Several Emperors of the [[Qing Dynasty]] were born to Mongol mothers.

With the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Mongolia declared independence in 1911. The new country's territory was approximately that of the former Outer Mongolia. After the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, Chinese troops led by [[Xu Shuzheng]] attacked and occupied the capital in 1919, but were expelled by the Soviet [[Red Army]] soon after. In 1924, the [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolian People's Republic]] was proclaimed and was backed by the Soviets.

=== Alignment with Soviet Union ===
{{main article|People's Republic of Mongolia}}
The Mongolian People's Republic was aligned closely with the [[Soviet Union]]. Politicians who demanded a more capitalist course and who dissented against collective prosperity, like Dogsomyn Bodoo or Horloogiyn Dandzan, quickly became unpopular. In 1928, [[Horloogiyn Choybalsan]] rose to power. Under his administration, forced but productive [[collective farming|collectivisation]] was instituted, and the destruction of [[Buddhist]] [[monastery|monasteries]] in 1937 left more than 10,000 insurgent lamas dead.

During the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Soviet-Japanese Border War]] of 1939, the USSR defended Mongolia against [[Japan]] during the [[Battle of Halhin Gol]]. Mongolian forces also took part in the Soviet offensive against Japanese forces in Inner Mongolia in August 1945 (see [[Operation August Storm]]). The threat of Mongolian forces seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced the [[Republic of China]] to recognize Outer Mongolia's independence, provided that a referendum was held. The referendum took place on [[October 20]] [[1945]], with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], both countries recognized each other on [[October 6]], [[1949]].

After Choybalsan died in [[Moscow]] on [[January 26]], [[1952]], [[Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal]] took power. In 1956 and again in 1962, Choybalsan's [[personality cult]] was condemned. Mongolia continued to align itself closely with the Soviet Union, especially after the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the late [[1950s]]. While Tsedenbal was visiting Moscow in August 1984, his severe illness prompted the parliament to announce his retirement and replace him with [[Jambyn Batmonh]].

In 1990, the Communist Party relinquished control over the government without violence. A new constitution was prepared in 1992 that abolished the People's Republic and created a [[Democracy|democratic]] state.

=== 1990 Democratic Revolution ===
{{sectstub}}

== حکومت او سياست ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=مغولستان}}
Until [[June 27]], [[2004]], the predominant party in Mongolia was the ex-communist [[Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]], or MPRP, which was formed by Mongolia's communist leaders after the end of the Cold War. The main opposition party was the [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]] or DP, which controlled a governing coalition from 1996 to 2000.

From 2000 to 2004 MPRP was back in power, but results of the 2004 elections required the establishing of the first ever coalition government in Mongolia between the MPRP and MDC (Motherland Democratic Coalition).

Mongolia's [[president]] has a symbolic role. The current President of Mongolia is [[Nambaryn Enkhbayar]].

=== The Parliament (State Great Hural) ===
Mongolia uses a [[unicameral]] [[parliamentary system]] in which the [[president]] has a symbolic role and the "government" chosen by the legislature exercises executive power. The legislative arm, the [[State Great Khural]], has one chamber with 76 seats and is chaired by the speaker of the house.

On [[January 14]], [[2006]], the parliament's 39 members, mostly MPRP but including 4 Democratic Party members ([[Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan]], [[Narantsatsralt]], [[Mishig Sonompil]], and [[J. Batkhuyag]]), overthrew Democrat [[Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj]]'s grand coalition government. It has been claimed that this violated the [http://www.mongolia-foreign-policy.net/index.php?moduls=1|Mongolian Constitution], as the parliament exceeded its power. The decision to overthrow Elbegdorj's government was based on the MPRP Directing Board's decision, contrary to its three agreements with the Democratic Party. The action has been protested.

Mongolia maintains friendly relations with the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Japan]], the [[Republic of China]], and virtually all countries in the world. It has initiated large foreign investment initiatives and encouraged foreign investment. It supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], or "[[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]," and has sent 200 troops to [[Iraq]].

== جغرافيه او اقليم ==
[[دوتنه:Mg-map.png|thumb|300px|د مغولستان نخشه]]
{{main|د مغولستان جغرافيه}}

The Mongolian heartland consists of relatively flat [[steppe]]s. The southern portion of the country is taken up by the [[Gobi Desert]], while the northern and western portions are mountainous. The highest point in Mongolia is Nayramadlin Orgil (Huyten Orgil) at 4,374&nbsp;m (14,350 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]). [[Uvs Nuur Lake]], shared with [[Tuva Republic]] in the [[Russian Federation]], is a natural [[World Heritage Site]].

Most of the country is hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter, with January averages dropping as low as -30�C (-22�F). The country is also subject to occasional harsh climatic conditions known as ''[[zud]]'' or ''dzud''.  Ulaanbaatar has the coldest average temperature of any national capital in the world.

Mongolia is high, cold, and dry. It has an extreme continental climate with long, cold winters and short summers, during which most of its annual precipitation falls. The country averages 257 cloudless days a year, and it is usually at the center of a region of high atmospheric pressure. Precipitation is highest in the north (average of 20 to 35 centimeters per year) and lowest in the south, which receives 10 to 20 centimeters annually. The extreme south is the Gobi, some regions of which receive no precipitation at all in most years. The name "Gobi" is a Mongol term for a desert, depression, salt marsh, or steppe, but which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support marmots but with enough to support camels. Mongols distinguish Gobi from desert proper, although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian landscape. Gobi rangelands are fragile and are easily destroyed by overgrazing, which results in expansion of the true desert, a stony waste where not even [[Bactrian camel]]s can survive.

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|د مغولستان اقتصاد}}

Mongolia's economy is centered on agriculture and mining. Mongolia has rich mineral resources, and [[copper]], [[coal]], [[molybdenum]], [[tin]], [[tungsten]], and [[gold]] account for a large part of industrial production. In the 1990s, the disappearance of Soviet aid due to the fall of the Soviet Union accounted for the closing of many industrial facilities in Mongolia. Following decades of state-run enterprise, the economy began a transition to  [[capitalism]], occasionally painfully; in 2000-2002, opposition to privatization, as well as droughts and other natural disasters, contributed to a negative GDP growth. However, growth picked up in 2004 and 2005 with increases of 10.6% and 5.5%, respectively, largely due to the high price of commodities (gold and copper).

There are currently over 30,000 independent businesses in Mongolia, chiefly centered around the capital city {{Citation needed}}. The majority of the population outside urban areas participate in subsistence herding; livestock typically consists of cows, sheep, goats, horses, and Bactrian camels. Agricultural crops include wheat, barley, vegetables, and other forage crops. 

GDP per capita in 2005 was $1,900 [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mg.html].  Although GDP has risen steadily since 2002 at the rate of 6.2% in an official 2005 estimate, the state is still working to overcome a sizable trade deficit. A massive ($11 billion) foreign debt to Russia was settled by the Mongolian government in 2004 with a $250 million payment; this reduced value was accepted due to Mongolian hardship and the loss of human lives during the Soviet Era.<ref>[http://www.bizmongolia.mn/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=185 "Gift on a New Year Eve"]. ''Bizmongolia.com'', January 01. 2004</ref> Mongolia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1997, seeking to integrate itself in the Asian regional economies, and now exports [[cashmere]], minerals, and food products to Russia, the United States, China, Japan, Italy, and other countries.

Despite growth, the proportion of the population below the poverty line is estimated to be 36.1% in 2004, and both the unemployment rate and inflation rate are high at 6.7% and 10.9%, respectively [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mg.html]. 

=== Industrial sector ===
Industry currently accounts for 21.4% of GDP, approximately equal to the weight of the agriculture sector (20.4%). These industries include construction and construction materials, mining (coal, copper, molybdenum, fluorspar, tin, tungsten, and gold), oil, food and beverages, processing of animal products, and cashmere and natural fiber manufacturing. The industrial production growth rate is estimated to be 4.1% in 2002.  [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mg.html]

Mongolia has increasingly started to develop its technology industry since the democratic revolution of the early 1990s, and many new technology companies have been founded. Also, some technology companies in nearby countries ([[Korea]], [[China]]) have started to open offices in Mongolia.

=== Service sector ===
{{sectstub}}
After the democratic revolution of the early 1990s, Mongolian domestic production has picked up providing basic food production to its residents through increasing competition among companies. According to the CIA World Factbook, in 2003, the service sector accounted for 58% of the GDP, with 29% of the labor force of 1.488 million involved. 

=== Infrastructure ===

Mongolia has a relatively small and undeveloped infrastructure in terms of roads and electricity. Due to the nomadic nature of some parts of the population, the vast majority of the roadways are unpaved. However, investment from Korea and other countries have helped add more paved roads and electricity access to remote locations in Mongolia. The [[trans-Siberian railway]] passes through Mongolia between [[China]] and [[Russia]]. There are 48 airports throughout the country, including one international airport in [[Ulaanbaatar]], with service to [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and other countries. The air transport company of Mongolia is [[MIAT]].

The petroluem products and electricity used to power the infrastructure are in large part (80%) imported from Russia, which makes Mongolia vulnerable to supply side shocks, illustrating the influence of Mongolia's neighbors on its economy.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Mongolia}}
[[دوتنه:Mongolia-demography.png|thumb|220px|right|Demographics of Mongolia, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
Though the majority of Mongolian citizens are of [[Mongol]] descent there are small populations of [[Kazakh]], [[Tuvan]] and [[Tungus]] peoples. Mongolia's population growth rate is estimated at 1.54% (2000 census). About two-thirds of the total population is under age 30, 36% of whom are under 14. This relatively young and rapidly growing population has, as in many developing countries, placed strains on Mongolia's economy.
According to the [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mg.html CIA World Factbook], 50% of Mongolia's population are Buddhist-Lamaist, which is related to [[Tibetan Buddhism]].  40% are atheist, 6% are Shamanist or Christian, and 4% are Muslim.

Life in sparsely populated Mongolia has become more urbanized. Nearly half of the people live in the capital and in other provincial centers. Seminomadic life still predominates in the countryside where many families stay in villages during the cold winters and live in [[gers]] during the summer, though agricultural communities that are settled year-round are becoming more common. 

Ethnic Mongols account for about 85% of the population and consist of Khalkha and other groups, all distinguished primarily by dialects of the Mongol language. Mongol is an Altaic language--from the [[Altaic Mountains]] of Central [[Asia]], a language family comprising the Turkic, [[Tungusic]], and Mongolic subfamilies--and is related to Turkic ([[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Tatar]] and [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]]), and possibly [[Korea]]n and [[Japan]]ese. The [[Khalkha]] make up 90% of the ethnic Mongol population. The remaining 10% include Durbet Mongols and others in the north and Dariganga Mongols in the east. Turkic speakers (Kazakhs, [[Tuvans]], and [[Uyghur]]s) constitute 7% of Mongolia's population, and the rest are Tungusic-speakers, [[China|Chinese]], and [[Russia]]ns. Most, but not all, Russians left the country following the withdrawal of economic aid and collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The official language of Mongolia is [[Khalkha Mongol]], but there are variety of different dialects across the country.  In the more western parts of the country, where there is more ethnic diversity, primarily due to populations of ethnic [[Tuva]]ns and [[Kazakhs]], the [[Tuvan language]] and [[Kazakh language]], among others, are also spoken.  In the northern parts of the country, [[Russian language]] is frequently spoken among the Russian populations.  Furthermore, the Mongolian government has worked to encourage the learning of [[English language|English]] as a second language by having it replace the teaching of Russian in schools.

=== مذهب ===
{{sectstub}}
[[دوتنه:Lamas Rumtek.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Tibetan Buddhism]] is the most widely practiced religion.]]

Aside from brief periods of [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], various forms of [[shamanism]] have been widely practiced throughout the history of what is now modern day Mongolia, as such beliefs were common among nomadic people in Asian history.  Such beliefs gradually gave way to [[Tibetan Buddhism]], but shamanism has left a mark on Mongolian religious culture.  Indeed, some shamanistic practices and traditions are still practiced in rural areas.

Throughout much of the 20th century, the [[communist]] government ensured that the religious practices of the Mongolian people were largely repressed.  The fall of communism in 1991 allowed for religious practice to once again be made public, and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which had been the predominant religion in the region before the rise of Communism, rose to once again become the most widely practiced religion in Mongolia. The end of religious repression in the 1990s also allowed for other religions, such as [[Christianity]], to spread in the country.

=== زده کړې ===
{{sectstub}}
During much of 1970s and 1980s, the [[communist]] government emphasized large education initiatives, and as a result the [[public school]] system was very powerful and prevalent.  [[Chemistry]], [[Russian language]] and [[mathematics]] were emphasized. After the 1990 democratic revolution, study of different foreign languages start to pick up speed. Mongolia has a very high literacy rate with around 96% able to [[read]] and [[write]]. After the democratic revolution, many private colleges and schools were created, offering wide variety of studies, especially in the [[English language]]. Mongolia has named [[English language|English]] the second official language of Mongolia, replacing [[Russian language|Russian]]. 

Mongolia also has large national universities and colleges such as [[Mongolian National Technical University]] and [[Mongolian National University]] and many other military institutions and satellite colleges throughout the city of [[Ulaanbaatar]].

The culture of Mongolia can be described as [[homogeneous]]. 96% of the Mongolia's [[population]] is Vajrayana [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] in the [[Tibet]]an tradition. The official language, [[Khalkha Mongol]], is spoken by 90% of the population. Mongolia has its own ethnic group, which comprises 85% of the country's population.

Mongolia's population is about 2.6 million. 65% are in the 16-64 age bracket, and about 4% are over 64. HIV/AIDS has not made a significant impact, with only about 16 reported cases in the whole country.

Childbirth is 2.26 per woman, and the increase rate is high. Average life expectancy is 63 years, and the infant mortality rate is at 6%.

The main festival is Revolution Day, also known as [[Naadam]], which celebrates the anniversary of Mongolian independence from China. It is held on July 11.

In Mongolia, the khoomii, or [[throat singing]], style of music is popular, particularly in Western Mongolia.

The ornate symbol in the leftmost bar of the national flag is a Buddhist icon called a '''soyonbo'''. It represents the sun, moon, stars, and heavens per standard cosmologic symbology abstracted from that seen in traditional Tibetan [[thangka]] paintings.

=== Sports and recreation ===

The most famous sports competition is held during the [[Naadam]] festival in the summer for three days and includes [[horse racing]], [[archery]], and [[Mongolian wrestling]]. These three sports are the most widely watched and practiced throughout the country. [[Ski]]ing and other winter sports, many of which were introduced during the communist era, are also common.
