{{main articles|[[Early life of Hugo Chávez]] and [[Military career of Hugo Chávez]]}}
Chávez was born the second son of poor schoolteachers [[Hugo de los Reyes Chávez]] and [[Elena Frías de Chávez]] in [[Sabaneta, Barinas|Sabaneta]], [[Barinas State|Barinas]]. Of mixed  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], [[Africa]]n, and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent, Chávez and his five siblings were raised in a thatched palm leaf house. Later, Chávez and his older brother went to live with paternal grandmother [[Rosa Inés Chávez]] in Sabaneta proper. After elementary school, Chávez relocated to Barinas to attend the Daniel Florencio O'Leary School; he graduated with a science degree.<ref name="GOV_2005">{{Harv|Government of Venezuela|2005}}.</ref>

At the age of seventeen, Chávez enrolled at the [[Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences]]. After graduating in 1975 as a sub-lieutenant with master's degrees in [[military science]] and [[engineering]], Chávez entered military service for several months. He was then allowed to pursue graduate studies in [[political science]] at [[Caracas]]' [[Universidad Simón Bolívar|Simón Bolívar University]], but left without a degree. Over the course of his college years, Chávez and fellow students developed a fervently [[left-wing politics|left]]-[[nationalism|nationalist]] doctrine that they termed "[[Bolivarianism]]", inspired by the [[Pan-Americanism|Pan-Americanist]] philosophies of 19th-century Venezuelan revolutionary [[Simón Bolívar]], the influence of [[Peru]]vian dictator [[Juan Velasco Alvarado|Juan Velasco]], and the teachings of various socialist and communist leaders. Chávez engaged in sporting events and cultural activities during these years as well. Notably, Chávez played both baseball and softball with the ''Criollitos de Venezuela'', progressing with them to the Venezuelan National Baseball Championships in 1969. Chávez also authored numerous poems, stories and theatrical pieces.<ref name="GOV_2005">{{Harv|Government of Venezuela|2005}}.</ref>

Upon completing his studies, Chávez initially entered active-duty military service as a member of a [[counter-insurgency]] battalion stationed in Barinas. Chávez's military career lasted 17 years, during which time he held a variety of post, command, and staff positions, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Chávez also held a series of teaching and staffing positions at the Military Academy of Venezuela, where he was first acknowledged by his peers for his fiery lecturing style and unusually radical critique of Venezuelan government and society.<ref name="Gott_2005b">{{Harv|Gott|2005b}}.</ref> At this time, Chávez established the Bolivarian [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200]] (MBR-200). Afterward, he rose to fill a number of sensitive high-level positions in Caracas and was decorated several times.<ref name="GOV_2005">{{Harv|Government of Venezuela|2005}}.</ref>

== Coup attempt (1992) ==
{{main|1992 Venezuelan coup attempt of Hugo Chávez}}
After an extended period of popular dissatisfaction and economic decline <ref name="Schuyler_2001_10">{{Harv|Schuyler|2001|p=10}}.</ref> under the [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] administration of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]], Chávez made extensive preparations for a military-civilian [[coup d'état]] <ref name="Guillermoprieto_2005">{{Harv|Guillermoprieto|2005}}.</ref> Initially planned for December, Chávez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of [[February 4]], [[1992]]. On that date, five army units under Chávez's command barreled into urban Caracas with the mission of assaulting and overwhelming key military and communications installations throughout the city, including the Miraflores presidential palace, the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport, and the Historical Museum. Chávez's ultimate goal was to intercept and take custody of Pérez before he returned to Miraflores from an overseas trip. 
[[دوتنه:Chavez 1994 AFP 1.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Reporters interview Chávez following his 1994 release from prison. Although the coup for which Chávez was imprisoned failed, it elevated him into the national spotlight.]]

Chávez held the loyalty of some 10% of Venezuela's military forces;<ref name="Gott_2005_64">{{Harv|Gott|2005|p=64}}.</ref> still, numerous betrayals, defections, errors, and other unforeseen circumstances soon left Chávez and a small group of other rebels completely cut off in the Historical Museum, without any means of conveying orders to their network of spies and collaborators spread throughout Venezuela.<ref name="Gott_2005_63">{{Harv|Gott|2005|p=63}}.</ref> Worse, Chávez's allies were unable to broadcast their prerecorded tapes on the national airwaves in which Chávez planned to issue a general call for a mass civilian uprising against Pérez. As the coup unfolded, Pérez eluded capture, and fourteen soldiers were killed, and fifty soldiers and some eighty civilians injured, in the ensuing violence.<ref name="Gott_2005_69">{{Harv|Gott|2005|p=69}}.</ref> Nevertheless, rebel forces in other parts of Venezuela made swift advances and were ultimately able to take control of such large cities as [[Valencia]], [[Maracaibo]], and [[Maracay]] with the help of spontaneous civilian aid. Chávez's forces, however, had failed to take Caracas.<ref name="Gott_2005_66-67">{{Harv|Gott|2005|pp=66-67}}.</ref>

Chávez, alarmed, soon gave himself up to the government. He was then allowed to appear on national television to call for all remaining rebel detachments in Venezuela to cease hostilities. When he did so, Chávez famously quipped on national television that he had only failed "''por ahora''"—"for the moment".<ref name="Gott_2005_67">{{Harv|Gott|2005|p=67}}.</ref> Chávez was immediately catapulted into the national spotlight, with many poor Venezuelans seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and [[kleptocracy]].<ref name="Gott_2005_67">{{Harv|Gott|2005|p=67}}.</ref><ref name="O'Keefe_2005">{{Harv|O'Keefe|2005}}.</ref> Afterwards, Chávez was sent to Yare prison; meanwhile, Pérez, the coup's intended target, was impeached a year later. While in prison, Chávez developed a [[carnosity]] of the eye, which spread to his [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The clarity of his eyesight was slowly corrupted; despite treatments and operations, Chávez's eyesight was permanently weakened.<ref name="Chávez 2005b">{{Harv|Chávez|2005b}}.</ref>

== Political rise (1992–1999) ==
{{main|Venezuelan presidential election, 1998}}
After a two-year imprisonment, Chávez was pardoned by [[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Rafael Caldera]] in 1994. Upon his release, Chávez immediately reconstituted the MBR-200 as the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] (MVR—''Movimiento Quinta República'', with the [[V]] representing the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] five). Later, in 1998, Chávez began to campaign for the presidency. In working to gain the trust of voters, Chávez drafted an agenda that drew heavily on his philosophy of Bolivarianism. Chávez thus campaigned on an anti-[[political corruption|corruption]] and anti-[[poverty]] platform, while pledging to dismantle ''[[puntofijismo]]'', the traditional two-party [[patronage]] system.<ref name="Guillermoprieto_2005">{{Harv|Guillermoprieto|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Wilpert_2003">{{Harv|Wilpert|2003}}.</ref> Controversially, foreign banks — including Spain's [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria]] (BBVA) and [[Banco Santander Central Hispano|Banco Santander]], each the owner of one of Venezuela's largest banks — illicitly funneled millions of dollars into Chávez's campaign.<ref name="Marcano_2005_50">{{Harv|Marcano|2005|p=50}}.</ref><ref name="Toro_2004">{{Harv|Toro|2004}}.</ref>

Another of Chávez' first controversial steps was to invite former military dictator Perez Jimenez for his presidential inauguration. Perez Jimenez finally did not go to Venezuela as there was still a charge against him for murder.

Chávez utilized his [[charismatic authority|charisma]] and flamboyant public speaking style—noted for its abundance of [[colloquialism]]s and aggressive manner—on the campaign trail to win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and [[working class]] following. By May 1998, Chávez's support had risen to 30% in polls, and by August he was registering 39%. Chávez went on to win the [[Carter Center]]-endorsed [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1998|1998 presidential election]] on [[December 6]], [[1998]] with 56.2% of the vote.<ref name="Guillermoprieto_2005">{{Harv|Guillermoprieto|2005}}</ref><ref name="McCoy_Trinkunas_1999_49">{{Harv|McCoy|Trinkunas|1999|p=49}}.</ref>

== Presidency (1999–present) ==
{{main|Presidency of Hugo Chávez}}
Chávez's first presidential inauguration in 1999 led to widespread transformation and turmoil. Venezuelan society under Chávez has seen sweeping and radical shifts in social policy, moving away from the government officially embracing a [[free market]] economy and [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reform principles and towards quasi-socialist [[income redistribution]] and [[social welfare]] programs. Chávez has just as radically upended Venezuela's traditional foreign policy. Instead of continuing Venezuela's past support for U.S. and European strategic interests, Chávez has promoted alternative development and integration paradigms for the [[Third World|Global South]].
[[دوتنه:HugoChavez1823.jpeg|thumb|left|225px|Chávez holds up a miniature copy of the 1999 [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan Constitution]] at the 2005 [[World Social Forum]] held in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]].]]

Chávez's reforms have drawn both critical acclaim and bitter condemnation. He has alienated some upper and middle class Venezuelans, who have reported political repression and human rights violations under his rule. The controversy surrounding Chávez's policies spawned a transitory 2002 overthrow of Chávez, a 2004 recall attempt, and rumors and allegations regarding foreign conspiracies to overthrow Chávez via additional military coups, assassination attempts, and even military invasions. Nevertheless, Chávez remains a powerful figure in modern politics and a focal point for growing international resistance to the [[Washington Consensus]] and [[Foreign relations of the United States|United States foreign policy]].

=== 1999 ===
Chávez was sworn in as president on [[February 2]], [[1999]]. Among his first acts was the launching of [[Plan Bolivar 2000]], which included road building, housing construction, and mass [[vaccination]].<ref name="Harnecker_2003">{{Harv|Harnecker|2003}}.</ref> Chávez also halted planned [[privatization]]s of, among others, the national social security system, aluminum industry holdings, and the oil sector.<ref name="Ellner_2005">{{Harv|Ellner|2005}}.</ref> Nevertheless, Chávez also sought [[foreign direct investment]] to prevent chronic [[capital flight]] and monetary [[inflation]]. Chávez also reduced oil extraction, seeking to gain more revenues from the resulting higher oil prices and lobbying [[OPEC]] to do likewise. Chávez also attempted renegotiation of decades-old agreements with Philips Petroleum and [[ExxonMobil]]<ref name="CCR_2006">{{Harv|Center for Cooperative Research|2006}},</ref> seeking to gain more royalties. He also overhauled the formerly lax tax collection and [[financial audit|auditing]] system — especially regarding major corporations and landholders — by increasing its fairness and efficiency.

Responding to repeated blockage of his movement's legislation by anti-Chávez opposition members of the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]], Chávez scheduled two fresh national elections for July 1999, including a referendum for and elections to fill a new constitutional assembly. The Constitutional Assembly was created when the referendum passed with a 71.78% "yes" vote, while the pro-Chávez ''Polo Patriotico'' ("Patriotic Pole") won 95% (120 out of the total 131) of its seats. In August 1999, the Constitutional Assembly's "Judicial Emergency Committee" declared a "legislative emergency" whereby a seven-member committee conducted the National Assembly's functions; meanwhile, the National Assembly was prohibited from holding meetings.<ref name="Mcgirk_27Dec1999">{{Harv|Mcgirk|1999}}.</ref> The Constitutional Assembly drafted the [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 Venezuelan Constitution]], which included an increase in the presidential term from five to six years, a new presidential two-term limit, and a new provision for presidential [[recall election]]s, expanded presidential powers (including the power to dissolve the National Assembly), conversion of the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] National Assembly into a weakened [[unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature, merit-based appointments of judges, and creation of the Public Defender, an office authorized to regulate the activities of the presidency and the National Assembly. Chávez styled the new Public Defender as guardian of the government's "moral branch", tasked with defending public and moral interests. In December 1999, the new constitution was approved in a nationwide election with a 71.78% "yes" vote.

=== 2000–2001 ===
{{main|Venezuelan presidential election, 2000}}
Elections for the new unicameral National Assembly were held on [[July 30]], [[2000]]. During this same election, Chávez himself stood for reelection. Chávez's coalition garnered a commanding two-thirds majority of seats in the National Assembly while Chávez [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2000|was reelected]] with 60% of the votes. The [[Carter Center]] monitored the 2000 presidential election; their report on that election stated that, due to lack of transparency, CNE partiality, and political pressure from the Chávez government that resulted in unconstitutionally early elections, it was unable to validate the official CNE results.<ref name="McCoy_Neuman_2001_71-72">{{Harv|McCoy|Neuman|2001|pp=71-72}}.</ref> Later, on [[December 3]], [[2000]], local elections and a referendum were held. The referendum, backed by Chávez, proposed a law that would force Venezuela's labor unions to hold state-monitored elections.  The referendum was widely condemned by international labor organizations—including the [[International Labour Organization]] — as undue government interference in internal union matters; these organizations threatened to apply [[international sanctions|sanctions]] on Venezuela.<ref name="McCoy_Neuman_2001_73">{{Harv|McCoy|Neuman|2001|p=73}}.</ref>

After the May and July 2000 elections, Chávez backed the passage of the "[[enabling act|Enabling Act]]" by the National Assembly. This act allowed Chávez to [[rule by decree]] for one year. In November 2001, shortly before the Enabling Act was set to expire, Chávez enacted a set of 49 decrees. These included the Hydrocarbons Law and the Land Law, which are detailed below. [[Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce|Fedecámaras]], a national business federation, opposed the new laws and called for a general business [[strike action|strike]] on [[December 10]], [[2001]]. The strike failed to significantly impact Chávez's policies, however. By the end of the first three years of his presidency, Chávez's main policy concerns had successfully challenged the Venezuelan oligarchy's control over Venezuela's land, and introduced reforms aimed at improving the social welfare of the population by lowering infant mortality rates, introducing land reform, and implementing a cursory government-funded free [[healthcare system]] and education up to university level.<ref name="CCR_2006">{{Harv|Center for Cooperative Research|2006}}.</ref> By December of 2001, Chávez's capital-control policies had reduced inflation from 40% to 12% while generating 4% economic growth. His administration also reported an increase in primary school enrollment by one million students.<ref name="CCR_2006">{{Harv|Center for Cooperative Research|2006}}.</ref>

=== 2002 ===
{{main|Venezuelan coup attempt of 2002}}
On [[April 11]], [[2002]], some 500,000 anti-Chávez demonstrators marched to [[Miraflores presidential palace|Miraflores]] and clashed with pro-Chávez demonstrators there. Alarmed, Chávez commandeered the airwaves in the early afternoon, asking protesters to return to their homes, playing pre-recorded speeches, and attempting a blackout of coverage on the violence. Then, army commander-in-chief Lucas Rincón Romero reported in a nationwide broadcast that Chávez had resigned from the presidency. Chávez was then held at a military base while coup leaders appointed [[Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce|Fedecámaras]] president [[Pedro Carmona]] as interim president. Carmona's first decree reversed all of the major social and economic policies that comprised Chávez's "Bolivarian Revolution", including loosening Chávez's credit controls and ending his oil price quotas by raising production back to pre-Chávez levels. Carmona also dissolved both the National Assembly and the Venezuelan judiciary, while reverting the nation's name back to ''República de Venezuela''. Pro-Chávez demonstrations then erupted across Caracas. In response, pro-Chávez troops led a counter-coup and freed Chávez from captivity.<ref name="Gott_2005_234-236">{{Harv|Gott|2005|pp=234-236}}.</ref> 
[[دوتنه:Chavezsurvivescoup.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Chávez makes a dramatic return to power on [[April 13]], [[2002]] following a [[Venezuelan coup attempt of 2002|two-day coup d'état]].]]

Chávez resumed as president on the night of [[April 13]], [[2002]] and initiated several investigations whose results supported Chávez's assertions that the coup was U.S.-sponsored.<ref name="Vulliamy_21Apr2002">{{Harv|Vulliamy|2002}}.</ref><ref name="CCR_2006">{{Harv|Center for Cooperative Research|2006}}.</ref> Chávez also replaced the upper echelons of the military command and boosted benefits for veterans and started new civilian-military development programs. Chávez, seeking more funds for social programs, moved in late 2002 to bring [[Petróleos de Venezuela|PDVSA]] under greater government control. In response, for two months following [[December 2]], [[2002]], resistant PDVSA managers and many workers attempted to halt oil extraction and export. Resulting hydrocarbon shortages and loss of oil revenues put pressure on Chávez's government. Chávez answered by sacking PDVSA's management together with some 18,000 workers, resulting in a production rebound over subsequent months.

=== 2003–2004 ===
{{main|Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004}}
In 2003, Chávez created [[Mission Guaicaipuro]] ([[October 12]], [[2003]]), [[Mission Robinson]] (July 2003), [[Mission Sucre]] (late 2003), and [[Mission Ribas]] (November 2003). In July 2004, speaking to 50,000 formerly illiterate Mission Robinson beneficiaries, Chávez stated that "it was truly a world record: in a year, we have graduated 1,250,000 Venezuelans". Additionally, the inflation rate eased from 31% (2002) to 27% (2003). In contrast, setbacks included a [[Putative Venezuelan coup of 2004|putative 2004 coup attempt]], whose significance stirred controversy.<ref name="EP_2004">{{Harv|El Pais|2004}}.</ref>

=== 2004–present ===
After his referendum victory, Chávez used Venezuela's increasing oil revenues — from rises in world oil prices — to focus on expanding social programs. Economic growth also picked up markedly, reaching double-digit growth in 2004 and a projected 8% growth rate for 2005. In late March 2005, the Chávez government criminalized broadcast [[libel]] and [[slander]] directed against public officials, including prison sentences of up to 40 months for serious cases. Yet, when asked if he would ever impose such penalties, Chávez stated that "I don't care if they [the private media] call me names.... As [[Don Quixote]] said, 'If the dogs are barking, it is because we are working.'"<ref name="BBC_Talking_Point_23Oct2005">{{Harv|BBC Talking Point|2005}}.</ref> Chávez also expanded social programs via new Missions: [[Mission Vuelta al Campo]], phases II and III of [[Mission Barrio Adentro]], and [[Mission Miranda]].

Chávez's foreign policy included [[humanitarian aid]], construction projects, and other agreements with [[Argentina]]'s [[Nestor Kirchner]], [[China]]'s [[Hu Jintao]], [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]], and [[Iran]]'s [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. On [[March 4]], [[2005]], Chávez publicly declared that the U.S.-backed [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) was "dead". Chávez also stated his desire for the establishment of a Latin American analogue of [[NATO]]. At Chávez's direction, the military also began shifting armaments procurements to non-U.S. sources, including Brazil, China, Russia, and Spain. Meanwhile, Chávez ordered all active-duty U.S. soldiers to leave Venezuela. In 2005, he created the 1.5 million-strong Mission Miranda "military reserve" program.<ref name="Wagner_25Apr2005">{{Harv|Wagner|2005b}}.</ref> In October 2005, Chávez banished the "[[New Tribes Mission]]" from the country, accusing it of "imperialist infiltration" and collaboration with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].<ref name="Alford_14Oct2005">{{Harv|Alford|2005}}.</ref> Chávez's government also gave Amazonian indigenous peoples inalienable titles to 6,800 km&sup2; of lands and launched [[Mission Guaicaipuro]].

== Political impact ==
=== Labor ===
Chávez has had a combative relationship with the nation's largest [[trade union]] confederation, the [[Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela]] (CTV), which is historically aligned with the [[Democratic Action|Acción Democrática]] party. During the December 2000 local elections, Chávez placed a referendum measure on the ballot that would mandate state-monitored elections within unions. The measure, which was condemned by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) as undue interference in internal union matters, passed by a large margin on a very low electoral turnout. In the ensuing CTV elections, [[Carlos Ortega]] declared his victory and remained in office as CTV president, while ''Chavista'' (pro-Chávez) candidates declared fraud.

The ''Unión Nacional de los Trabajadores'' (UNT — "National Union of Workers"), a new pro-Chávez union federation, formed in response, and has been growing in membership; it seeks to ultimately supplant the CTV. Several ''Chavista'' unions have withdrawn from the CTV because of their strident anti-Chávez activism, and have instead affiliated with the UNT. In 2003, Chávez chose to send UNT, rather than CTV, representatives to an annual ILO meeting.

At the request of its workers, Chávez [[nationalization|nationalized]] Venepal, a formerly closed paper and cardboard manufacturing firm, on [[January 19]], [[2005]]. Workers had occupied the factory floor and restarted production, but following a failed deal with management and amidst management threats to liquidate the firm's equipment, Chávez ordered the nationalization, extended a line of credit to the workers, and ordered that the Venezuelan educational missions purchase more paper products from the company. <!--This paragraph, and the section in general, needs clarifying and expansion. Merely listing names and terms with minimal descriptions does not tell new readers the information they need, nor does it set proper context; for example, what's the significance of the nationalization of Venepal? -->

=== Economy ===
{{main|Bolivarian Missions}}
Venezuela is a major producer of oil products, which remain the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. Chávez has gained a reputation as a price hawk in [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries|OPEC]] by pushing for stringent enforcement of production quotas and higher target oil prices. He has also attempted to broaden Venezuela's customer base, striking joint exploration deals with other developing countries, including [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[China]] and [[India]]. Record oil prices have meant more funding for social programs, but have left the economy increasingly dependent on both the Chávez government and the oil sector; the private sector's role has correspondingly diminished. Despite the high government income, official unemployment figures have remained above 11%.<ref name="VA_20Jul2005">{{Harv|Venezuela Analysis|2005a}}.</ref>
[[دوتنه:Chavez in Arab SouthAmerica Summit.jpeg|thumb|left|225px|Chavéz attends the Arab-South America Summit held on [[May 5]], [[2005]] in [[Brasília]], [[Brazil]]. He is flanked by [[Qatar]]i Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Prime Minister [[Najib Mikati]] ''(Agência Brasil)''.]]

Chávez has redirected the focus of [[Petróleos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil company, by bringing it more closely under the direction of the Energy Ministry. He has also attempted to repatriate more oil funds to Venezuela by raising royalty percentages on joint extraction contracts that are payable to Venezuela. Chávez has also explored the liquidation of some or all of the assets belonging to PDVSA's U.S.-based subsidiary, [[CITGO]]. The oil ministry has been successful in restructuring CITGO's profit structure,<ref name="Ramirez_2005">{{Harv|Ramirez|2005}}.</ref> resulting in large increases in dividends and income taxes from PDVSA. In 2005, CITGO announced the largest dividend payment to PDVSA in over a decade, $400 million. Yet despite massive efforts to increase production, daily oil production is still well short of the levels attained under the previous administration.

Chávez's domestic policy is embodied by the [[Bolivarian Missions]], a series of [[social justice]] programs that have radically altered the economic and cultural landscape of Venezuela. Although recent economic activity under Chávez has been robust under these programs,<ref name="Latin Business Chronicle 2005">{{Harv|Latin Business Chronicle|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Weisbrot_2005">{{Harv|Weisbrot|2005}}.</ref> per-capita [[gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2004 has dropped around 1% from 1999 levels.<ref name="CIA 2005">{{Harv|Central Intelligence Agency|2005}}.</ref><ref name="CIA_1999">{{Harv|Central Intelligence Agency|1999}}.</ref> However, as of September 2005, there have also been significant drops since 1999 in unemployment<ref name="VA_2005">{{Harv|Venezuela Analysis|2005b}}.</ref> and in the government's definition of "poverty",<ref name="Venezuela Analysis 14 Oct 2005">{{Harv|Venezuela Analysis|2005}}.</ref> and there have been marked improvements in national health indicators between 1998 and 2005.<ref name="CIA 1998">{{Harv|Central Intelligence Agency|1998}}.</ref><ref name="CIA 2005">{{Harv|Central Intelligence Agency|2005}}.</ref>

=== Foreign affairs ===
{{main|Foreign policy of Hugo Chávez}}
Chávez has refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his "oil diplomacy".<ref name="Economist_2005">{{Harv|Economist|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Wagner_01Feb2005">{{Harv|Wagner|2005}}.</ref> Examples include [[PetroCaribe]], Petrosur, and [[Telesur]]. Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries have also played a major role in his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba,<ref name="Macbeth_2005">{{Harv|Macbeth|2005}}.</ref> funding an approximately $300 million ''ex gratia'' oil pipeline built to provide discounted natural gas to Colombia,<ref name="El Tiempo_25Nov2005">{{Harv|El Tiempo|2005}}.</ref> and initiating barter arrangements that, among other things, exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash-strapped Argentina's meat and dairy products. Additionally, Chávez worked closely with other Latin American leaders following the 1997 [[Summit of the Americas]] in many areas — especially energy integration — and championed the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] decision to adopt the Anti-Corruption Convention. Chávez's government also participates in the [[United Nations]] Friends groups for [[Haiti]], and is pursuing efforts to join and engage the [[Mercosur]] trade bloc to expand the hemisphere's trade integration prospects. Abroad, Chávez denounces both [[neocolonialism]] and [[neoliberalism]], including U.S. foreign policy regarding Iraq, Haiti, and the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]; meanwhile, he had severed military ties with the U.S. Chávez's has also lobbied OPEC producers to decrease production ceilings. Pursuing this goal, Chávez made a ten-day tour of OPEC countries; he thus became the first [[head of state]] to meet [[Saddam Hussein]] since the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="CNN 10 Aug 2000">{{Harv|CNN|2000}}.</ref>
[[دوتنه:Kircher Chavez.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Chávez and Argentine President [[Néstor Kirchner]] discuss energy and trade integration projects for South America. They met on [[November 21]], [[2005]] in [[Venezuela]] as a gesture of mutual solidarity in their opposition to the [[Washington Consensus]] and the [[FTAA]] proposal ''(Office of the Argentine Presidency)''.]]

After [[Hurricane Katrina]] battered the U.S. in late 2005, Chávez's administration was the first government to offer aid to its "North American brothers", offering to donate tons of food, water, mobile hospital units, medical specialists, power generators, and one million barrels of petroleum. Additionally, he proposed to sell 66,000 barrels of steeply discounted heating fuel directly to affected poor communities. The Bush administration refused this aid.<ref name="Martin_02Sep2005">{{Harv|Martin|2005}}.</ref> Later, in November 2005, officials in [[Massachusetts]] signed an agreement with Venezuela to provide heating oil at a 40% discount to low income families via [[CITGO]], a PDSVA subsidiary.<ref name="BBC_2005d">{{Harv|BBC News|2005d}}.</ref> Chávez has stated that such aid comprises "a strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage" and that "[i]t is a card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest country in the world, the United States."<ref name="blum_22Nov2005">{{Harv|Blum|2005}}.</ref> Nevertheless, Venezuela's foreign affairs are also often driven by Chávez's rhetoric, with insults directed against [[George W. Bush]] (who he labelled a ''[[pendejo]]'' ("jerk")), [[Condoleezza Rice]] (a "complete illiterate" with regards to comprehending Latin America.<ref name="Ministerio de Comunicación e Información 1999">{{Harv|Ministerio de Comunicación e Información|1999}}.</ref><ref name="Diehl_2005">{{Harv|Diehl|2005}}.</ref><ref name="People's_Daily_12Jan2004">{{Harv|People's Daily|2004}}.</ref>), and [[Vicente Fox]] (who was "bleeding from his wounds" and was warned not to "mess" with him<ref name="BBC_14Nov2005">{{Harv|BBC News|2005c}}.</ref>). The latter comments resulted in the severing of diplomatic ties between Mexico and Venezuela.

== Media treatment ==
{{main|Media representation of Hugo Chávez}}
Even before the April 2002 coup, many owners, managers, and commentators working for the five major private mainstream television networks and largest mainstream newspapers had stated their opposition to Chávez's policies. These media outlets have accused the Chávez administration of intimidating their journalists using specially-dispatched gangs. Chávez in turn alleges that the owners of these networks have primary allegiance not to Venezuela but to the United States, and that they seek the advancement of [[neoliberalism]] via corporate [[propaganda model|propaganda]].

Throughout his presidency, Chávez has hosted the live talk show known as ''[[Aló, Presidente!]]'' ("Hello, President!").<ref name="Lakshmanan_2005">{{Harv|Lakshmanan|2005}}.</ref> The show broadcasts in varying formats on [[Venezolana de Televisión]] (VTV—Venezuelan State Television) each Sunday at 11:00 AM. The show, which lasts for hours, features Chávez addressing topics of the day, taking phone calls and live questions from both the studio and broadcast audience, and touring locations where government social welfare programs are active. Additionally, on [[July 25]], [[2005]], Chávez inaugurated [[Telesur]], a proposed pan-American homologue of [[Al-Jazeera]] that seeks to challenge the present domination of Latin American television news by United States-based [[CNN en Español]] and [[Univision]]. Chávez's media policies have contributed to elevated tensions between the United States and Venezuela.<ref name="Wilpert_2005b">{{Harv|Wilpert|2005b}}.</ref>

== Bolivarianism ==
[[دوتنه:ChavezPeace.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Chávez delivers a speech on [[Bolivarianism]] to hundreds of thousands of ''[[chavista]]s'' along [[Caracas]]'s  Avenida Bolívar on [[May 16]], [[2004]]. Chávez political philosophy mostly developed during his days as a student and cadet.]]

Chávez's principles draw heavily from those of [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Ezequiel Zamora]], [[Simón Rodríguez]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[Federico Brito Figueroa]], [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Che Guevara]], and [[Salvador Allende]]. Later in life, Chávez stated that [[democratic socialism]] ([[socialism]] that emphasizes grassroots democratic participation) as key to his politics, working through such local vehicles as [[Bolivarian Circles]] and ''[[chavista]]'' support.<ref name="Sanchez_2003">{{Harv|Sanchez|2003}}.</ref><ref name="burke_30Jul2003">{{Harv|Burke|2003}}.</ref> At speeches at the 2005 [[World Social Forum]] and the 4th Summit on the Social Debt, Chávez declared democratic socialism as integral to Bolivarianism, proclaiming that humanity must embrace "a new type of socialism, a [[humanism|humanist]] one, which puts humans, and not machines or the state, ahead of everything."<ref name="Sojo_2005">{{Harv|Sojo|2005}}.</ref> The central points of Chávez's Bolivarianism are:<ref name="Wilpert_27Aug2003">{{Harv|Wilpert|2003a}}.</ref><ref name="Wilpert_2003">{{Harv|Wilpert|2003}}.</ref>

{{main|Criticism of Hugo Chávez}}
Chávez is a deeply disputed personality, both in Venezuela and abroad. His most steadfast domestic opponents state that Chávez is a dangerous [[militarism|militarist]] and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] revolutionary who poses a fundamental threat to Venezuelan democracy. The opposition also reports that both poverty and unemployment figures under Chávez have not seen significant improvements and that official corruption under his government continues to be rampant,<ref name="Jorquera_2005">{{Harv|Jorquera|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Parma_2005b">{{Harv|Parma|2005b}}.</ref> and point to the 1% drop in Venezuela's per-capita [[gross domestic product|GDP]] under Chávez. Opposition figures also cite the many public hospitals that lack even basic medicine and hygenic supplies, while others describe Chávez as a demagogue and his supporters as a personality cult, intended to help Chávez achieve power and adulation. For example, Chávez critics question the motives behind the Bolivarian Missions' regular cash and in-kind payments to the millions of poor Venezuelans enrolling in their social programs. They worry that receiving benefits from many Missions simultaneously will corrupt their work ethic and predispose them to support Chávez. However, the particular claims about the inefficacy of government programs that have eradicated poverty, illiteracy and ill health are also made specifically through media owned by the very upper class of Venezuela, and are strongly disputed by the lower classes who are the recipients of these government initiatives and constitute the bulk of the Chavista movement.

The opposition has also claimed that the Chávez government has engaged in extensive electoral fraud, especially during the 2000 and 2004 elections, and has reported that many anti-Chávez activists are detained as [[political prisoner]]s.<ref name="Boyd_04Jul2005">{{Harv|Boyd|2005}}.</ref> More sympathetic criticisms arise from reports that Chávez is not fulfilling his major campaign pledges with respect to labor and land reform.<ref name="Fuentes_26Sep2005">{{Harv|Fuentes|2005}}.</ref><ref name="marquez_05Apr2005">{{Harv|Márquez|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Parma_20Oct2005">{{Harv|Parma|2005a}}.</ref> Many claim that the beaureaucratic setup Chávez inherited has strongly corrupted roots, and are subversive or inefficient elements in the programs for social change. Abroad, sources in the Western mainstream news media have reported that Chávez is a confrontational [[ideology|ideologue]]<ref name="Sanchez 25 Aug 2005">{{Harv|Sanchez|2005}}.</ref> who willingly harbors, funds, and trains [[terrorism|terrorists]] in Venezuela and [[insurgency|insurgents]] abroad.<ref name="Robinson_2003">{{Harv|Robinson|2003}}.</ref><ref name="FAIR_2005">{{Harv|Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|2005}}.</ref>

As evidenced by the title caption, the pair is often reported by Western media as comprising a threat to hemispheric stability and security.]]

The human rights organizations [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] have documented human rights violations under Chávez.<ref name="AI_2005">{{Harv|Amnesty International|2005}}.</ref><ref name="HRW_2005">{{Harv|Human Rights Watch|2005}}.</ref> Scores of deaths and hundreds of injuries inflicted during both opposition and pro-Chávez demonstrations have resulted in little investigative action taken on the part of Chávez. These organizations have also made allegations of ill treatment of detainees, [[torture]], and [[censorship]] by the police and military. However, there is also much repression of lower class Chávez supporters and even social workers, and the local police act on behalf of the local mayors, many of whom are wealthy anti-Chavistas, rather than the central government. The government is currently attempting to nationalize police to eliminate local corruption. Meanwhile, relatives of victims who were killed in the April 11, 2002 clashes have filed a case against Chávez and others at the [[International Criminal Court]], stating that Chávez is legally complicit in [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. A decision on the case has not been reached because of his position as acting President. 

Chávez has also made controversial statements. In January 2006, he stated that “[t]he world is for all of us, then, but it so happens that a minority, the descendants of the same ones that crucified Christ, the descendants of the same ones that kicked Bolívar out of here and also crucified him in their own way over there in Santa Marta, in Colombia. A minority has taken possession all of the wealth of the world...”<ref name="Wiesenthal_2006">{{Harv|Wiesenthal|2006}}.</ref> The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] omitted the reference to Bolívar without ellipsis, stated that Chávez was referring to [[Jew]]s, and denounced the remarks as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] by way of his allusions to wealth. Meanwhile, the [[American Jewish Committee]], the [[American Jewish Congress]], and the Confederation of Jewish Associations of Venezuela all defended Chávez, stating that he was speaking not of Jews, but of South America's white oligarchy. Why Chávez would refer to this oligarchy as the killers of Christ is unclear, and is not addressed by any of these groups; but would seem to be a reference to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] government, whose soldiers were directly involved in the torture and execution of Christ, and from which most western European nations are descended. <ref name="Perelman_2006">{{Harv|Perelman|2006}}.</ref>

== Personal life ==
[[دوتنه:Chavezninas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chávez and his three daughters, Rosa Virginia, María Gabriela and Rosa Inés.]]
{{main|Personal life of Hugo Chávez}}
Hugo Chávez has been married twice. He first married [[Nancy Colmenares]], a woman from a poor family originating in Chávez's own hometown of Sabaneta. Chávez and Colmenares remained married for eighteen years, during which time they had three children: Rosa Virginia, María Gabriela, and Hugo Rafael. They separated soon after Chávez's 1992 coup attempt, but have remained good friends since then.<ref name="La Semana 2000">{{Harv|La Semana|2000}}.</ref> During his first marriage, Chávez also had an affair with young historian [[Herma Marksman]]; they had a relationship which lasted nine years.<ref name="Guillermoprieto_2005">{{Harv|Guillermoprieto|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Byrne_2005">{{Harv|Byrne|2005}}.</ref> At present, Chávez is separated from his second wife, journalist [[Marisabel Rodríguez de Chávez]]. Chávez had another daughter, Rosa Inés, through that marriage, in addition to a son-in-law, Raúl "Raúlito" Alfonzo.  Chávez also has one granddaughter, Gabriela.<ref name="Palast_2005">{{Harv|Palast|2005}}.</ref>

Chávez is of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] extraction, and is currently a practicing Christian. Nevertheless, he has had a series of bitter disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic clergy and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church hierarchies.<ref name="Kozloff_2005">{{Harv|Kozloff|2005}}.</ref><ref name="Morsbach_2006">{{Harv|Morsbach|2006}}.</ref> Although he has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, Chávez has over the course of his presidency become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of [[Jesus]]' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his leftist views:

:{|style="border:1px; border: none; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
|"He [Jesus] accompanied me in difficult times, in crucial moments. So Jesus Christ is no doubt a historical figure — he was someone who rebelled, an anti-imperialist guy. He confronted the Roman Empire.... Because who might think that Jesus was a capitalist?  No. Judas was the capitalist, for taking the coins! Christ was a revolutionary. He confronted the religious hierarchies. He confronted the economic power of the time. He preferred death in the defense of his [[humanism|humanistic]] ideals, who fostered change.... He is our Jesus Christ."<ref name="Chávez 2005b">{{Harv|Chávez|2005b}}.</ref>
