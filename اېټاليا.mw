'''اټاليا''', چې په رسمي چارو کې '''د اټاليا جمهوريت''' ([[اټاليايي]]: ''Italia'', [[نړېوال Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/i'talia/}} يا ''Repubblica Italiana'', [[نړېوال فونېټيک ابېڅې|IPA]]: {{IPA|/re'pubblika ita'ljana/}}), is a country in [[southern Europe]]. It comprises the boot-shaped [[Italian peninsula]], the [[Po River]] valley, and two large islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], and shares its northern [[alps|alpine]] boundary with [[فرانسه]], [[سويس]], [[اطريش]] and [[سلووېنيا]]. The independent countries of [[سان مارينو]] and the [[واټيکان ښار]] are [[enclave]]s within Italian territory.

For more than 3,000 years Italy witnessed many migrations and invasions from [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Celt]]ic, [[Frankish]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greek]], [[Saracens]], [[Norman]], and the French [[Angevin]], and [[Lombard]] peoples. Italy was also home to many well-known and influential civilisations, including the [[Etruscans]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and the [[ancient Rome|Romans]].

Italy is sometimes called ''Belpaese'' (Italian for ''beautiful country'') by its inhabitants, due to the beauty and variety of its landscapes and for its world's largest artistic patrimony; the country is home to the greatest number of [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Sites (40 until [[January 1]] [[2006]]).

Presently, Italy is a highly developed country with the 6th highest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2004, a member of [[G8]] and a founding member of what is now the [[European Union]] signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957.

Inhabitants of Italy are referred to as ''Italians'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Italiani''). There exist several theories concerning the origin of the name ''Italia'', but the most widely believed [[etymology]] is that it is derived from the ancient Greek word ''italos'' (bull).

== تاريخ ==
{{main|د اټاليا تاريخ}}

Italy has influenced the cultural and social development of the whole Mediterranean area, deeply influencing [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] as well. Important cultures and civilizations have existed there since prehistoric times. After [[Magna Graecia]], the [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] civilization and especially the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]] that dominated this part of the world for many centuries, Italy was central to European science and art during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].

Modern Italy became a nation-state belatedly — on [[March 17]] [[1861]], when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the [[Savoy]] dynasty, which ruled over [[Sardinia]] and [[Piedmont]]. The architects of Italian unification were [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]], the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], a general and national hero. [[Rome]] itself remained for a little less than a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] only on [[September 20]] [[1870]]. The [[Vatican City|Vatican]] is now an independent enclave surrounded by [[Rome]].

== سياست ==
{{main|د اټاليا سياست}}
[[دوتنه:Italy.CarloAzeglioCiampi.01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], President of the Italian Republic since 1999.]]
The 1948 [[Constitution of Italy]] established a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] (''Parlamento''), consisting of a [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Camera dei Deputati'') and a [[Italian Senate|Senate]] (''Senato della Repubblica''), a separate [[judiciary]], and an [[executive branch]] composed of a Council of Ministers ([[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]) (''Consiglio dei ministri''), headed by the [[Prime Minister of Italy|prime minister]] (''Presidente del consiglio dei ministri''). The [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]] (''Presidente della Repubblica'') is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (''fiducia'') of both houses.

The houses of [[parliament]] are popularly and directly elected by a mixed majoritarian<!-- this was changed, please update--> and proportional representation system. Under 1993 [[legislation]], Italy has single-member districts for 75% of the seats in parliament; the remaining 25% of seats are allotted on a proportional basis.
The Chamber of Deputies has officially 630 members (''de facto'', 619 only after the 2001 elections). In addition to 315 senators, elected members, the Senate includes former presidents and several other persons (no more than 5) appointed for life by the President of the Republic according to special constitutional provisions. Both houses are elected for a maximum of 5 years, but either may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term. [[Legislative]] bills may originate in either house and must be passed by a majority in both. The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later [[statute]]s. A constitutional court, the ''Corte Costituzionale'', passes on the constitutionality of laws, and is a post-[[World War II]] innovation.

All Italian citizens older than 18 can vote. To vote for the senate, the voter must be at least 25.

== Regions ==
{{main|Regions of Italy}}
[[دوتنه:It-map.png|thumb|Map of Italy]]

Italy is subdivided into 20 regions (''regioni'', singular ''regione''). Five of these regions enjoy a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on some of their specific local matters, and are marked by an *:
* [[Abruzzo]] (with capital [[L'Aquila]])
* [[Aosta Valley]]*, ''Valle d'Aosta / Vallée d'Aoste'' ([[Aosta]])
* [[Apulia]], ''Puglia'' ([[Bari]])
* [[Basilicata]] ([[Potenza]])
* [[Calabria]] ([[Catanzaro]])
* [[Campania]] ([[Naples]], ''Napoli'')
* [[Emilia-Romagna]] ([[Bologna]])
* [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]* ([[Trieste]]) 	 
* [[Latium]], ''Lazio'' ([[Rome]], ''Roma'')
* [[Liguria]] ([[Genoa]], ''Genova'')
* [[Lombardy]] ''Lombardia'' ([[Milan]], ''Milano'')
* [[Marche]] ([[Ancona]])
* [[Molise]] ([[Campobasso]])
* [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], ''Piemonte'' ([[Turin]], ''Torino'')
* [[Sardinia]]*, ''Sardegna'' ([[Cagliari]])
* [[Sicily]]*, ''Sicilia'' ([[Palermo]])
* [[Trentino-Alto Adige]]*, ''Trentino-Alto Adige / Südtirol'' ([[Trento]])
* [[Tuscany]], ''Toscana'' ([[Florence]] ''Firenze'')
* [[Umbria]] ([[Perugia]])
* [[Veneto]] ([[Venice]], ''Venezia'')

All regions except the Aosta Valley are further subdivided into two or more [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]].

== جغرافيه ==
{{main|د اټاليا جغرافيه}}

Italy consists predominantly of a large [[peninsula]] (the [[Italian peninsula]]) with a distinctive boot shape that extends into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], where together with its two main islands [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] it creates distinct bodies of water, such as the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the north-east, the [[Ionian Sea]] to the south-east, the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the south-west and finally the [[Ligurian Sea]] to the north-west.

The [[Apennine mountains]] form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the [[Alps]], the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north.
Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the [[Po River]]--which is Italy's biggest river--and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, [[Apennine]]s and [[Dolomites]].

Other well-known rivers include the [[Tiber]], [[Adige]] and [[Arno]].

Its highest point is [[Mont Blanc]] (''Monte Bianco'') at 4,810&nbsp;[[metre]]s  <!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM -->(15,781 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]), but Italy is more typically associated with two famous [[volcano]]es: the currently dormant [[Vesuvius]] near [[Naples]] and the very active [[Etna]] on [[Sicily]].

[[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] are the two major [[island]]s of Italy ([[List of islands of Italy|comprehensive list]]).

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Italy}}

Italy is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. The country has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 193 persons per square kilometre<!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --> (499/[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]). Indigenous minority groups are small. For a country of 58.4 million people, Italy has a smaller number of migrants compared to France and Germany. 

Since the beginning of Roman civilization, important ethnic groups like [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] settlers, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Celt]]ic invaders and plunderers, and Norman colonisers have all left important impressions on the people today. However, they have all been absorbed in a homogeneous [[Italian people|Italian ethnic group]].

The number of immigrants or foreign residents in Italy have steadily increased to reach 2,402,157, according to the latest figures (1/2005) of [[ISTAT]]. They currently make up a little more than 4 % of the official total population. According to these statistics, the largest foreign minorities are [[Albanians]] (316,659), [[Moroccan]] (294,945), [[Romanian people|Romanian]] (248,849{{rf|1|Romanian}}), [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] (111,712), and Ukrainian (93,441). Remaining groups include those who are Tunisian, Macedonians, Serbians, and Filipinos etc.

== مذهب ==
Roman Catholicism is by far the most popular religion in the country. According to estimates by (CIA World Fact Book 2005, Italian polls, Adherents.com, BBCNews and others), it is safe to conclude that 87% of the Italian population self-identify as [[Roman Catholic]], whereas around 13% identify with either other religions or none at all. Italy also has some important pilgrimages and famous Roman Catholic churches, cathedrals and sites. According to many other books (Reference) surveys (from Gallup, Christian Science Monitor, and others) Italy can claim above 40% weekly church attendance rate. [[دوتنه:St peters vat distance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Vatican City|Vatican]]]]

The second largest Christian group in Italy are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] with some 400,000 [2] active members, and are growing annually. There are few Protestant denominations in Italy, mostly Waldensians. Recent immigration from the [[North Africa]] has led to an increasing number of Muslims, but has cooled off due to larger immigration from Eastern Europe. The Muslim population currently stands at 825,000[3] (legal immigrants) or 1.4% of the population, lower than many Western European nations. Around 30,000 Jews, and 30,000 Buddhists live in Italy.

== اقتصاد ==
{{main|د اټاليا اقتصاد}}

A member of the G8 group of leading industrialised countries, it ranked as the sixth- largest economy in the world in 2004, behind the United States, Japan, Germany, UK, and France. According to the OECD, in 2004 Italy was the world's sixth-largest exporter of manufactured goods. This [[capitalism|capitalistic]] economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed [[agriculture|agricultural]] south (with 20% unemployment). 

Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates. Italy joined the [[Euro]] from its conception in 1999.

Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive [[pension]] system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from [[labor union|labour unions]].

== کلتور/فرهڼ ==
''See the separate article: [[د اټاليا کلتور/فرهڼ]].''

== Languages ==
{{main|Languages of Italy}}
The official language of Italy is [[Italian language|Standard Italian]] - a direct descendant of [[Latin]] (some 75% of Italian words are of Latin origin).

When Italy was unified, in 1861, Italian existed mainly as a [[literary language]], and was spoken by less than 3% of the population. Different languages were spoken throughout Italian peninsula, many of which were [[romance languages]] which had developed in every region, due to political fregmentation of Italy{{rf|2|dialects}}. 
Indeed, each historical region of Italy had its own so-called "dialect" (with "dialect" usually meaning, improperly, a non-Italian [[romance language]]), with variants existing at the township-level. 


Massimo d'Azeglio, one of Cavour's ministers, is said to have stated, following Italian unification, that having created Italy, all that remained was to create Italians. Given the high number of languages spoken throughout the peninsula, it was quickly established that 'proper' or 'standard' Italian would be based on the [[Tuscan dialect|Florentine dialect]] spoken in most of [[Tuscany]] (given that it was the first region to produce authors such as [[Dante Alighieri]], who between 1308 and 1321 wrote the ''[[Divina Commedia]]''). A national education system was established - leading to a decrease in variation in the languages spoken throughout the country over time. It was not until the 1960s, with the advent of the state television broadcaster, [[RAI]], that Italian truly became broadly-known and quite standardised.

Today, Italian is fully comprehensible to all throughout the country, but regional variations in the form of accents and vowel emphasis persist. In addition, particular dialects have become cherished beacons of regional variation and are becoming recently more protected (especially the Neapolitan dialect which is extensively used for the singing of popular folk-songs).

Apart from standard Italian, regional variations and "dialects", a number of truly separate languages do exist. In the north, the province of [[South Tyrol]] (''Südtirol'' in German, ''Alto Adige'' in Italian) is almost entirely [[German language|German]]-speaking; the area was awarded to Italy following the First World War and her defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Pockets of German speakers also persist in other north-eastern Italian regions - a remnant of the old Austrian influence on this area of Italy. In total some 300,000 or so Italians speak German as their first language and indeed identify themselves as ethnic Austrians. Some 120,000 or so people live in the [[Aosta Valley]] region, where a [[Franco-Provençal]] dialect very similar to French called ''[[Patois]]'' is spoken. About 80,000 [[Slovenian language|Slovene]]-speakers live in the north-eastern region of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] near the border with Slovenia. Some 40,000 [[Ladin]]-speakers (Ladin is a [[Rhaetian languages|Rhaetian language]] spoken in the [[Dolomites|Dolomite]] mountains) also live in the [[Trentino-South Tyrol]] region and in the [[Veneto]] region. A very large community of some 700,000 people in [[Friuli]] speak [[Friulian]] - another [[Rhaetian languages|Rhaetian language]]. In the [[Molise]] region of central-south Italy some 4,000 people (the [[Molise Croats]]) speak [[Serbo-Croatian]] - these are the descendants of a group of people who migrated from the Balkans in the Middle Ages. Scattered across Southern Italy are a number of some 30,000 [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers - considered to be the last surviving traces of the region's Greek heritage (Ancient Greek colonists reached Southern Italy and Sicily about 1500 BC), they speak a Greek dialect, [[Griko]]. Some 15,000 [[Catalan language|Catalan]] speakers reside around the area of [[Alghero]] in the north-west corner of [[Sardinia]] - believed to be the result of a migration of a large group of Catalans from [[Barcelona]] in ages past. Around 100,000 (the [[Arbëreshë]]) in Southern Italy and in central [[Sicily]] speak [[Albanian language|Albanian]] - the result of past migrations. Finally, the largest group of non-Italian speakers (some 1.6 million people) are the ones who speak [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] - a romance language which evolved quite independently from Italian. The arrival of immigrants has generated a plethora of new languages, including [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]],[[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and others. Even today, variations in local accents allow people from one town to distinguish people from a neighbouring town which may be only a few miles away. There is a growing population of Jews and Muslims in Italy, many of whom speak Hebrew and Arabic, respectively.

== Notes ==
{{ent|1|Romanian}} According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37.2% of 2.8 million immigrants in that country [http://www.evz.ro/eveniment/?news_id=201813] but it is unclear how the estimate was made, and therefore whether it should be taken seriously or not.
