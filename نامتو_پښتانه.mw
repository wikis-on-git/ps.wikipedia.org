'''[[:en:Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]''' (also Pakhtuns), '''Pathans''' or '''ethnic Afghans''' are people that form one ethnic group, which is made up of approximately 42 million individuals living in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as in certain major cities of India and western parts of Iran. The Pashtuns (''Pash-tunes'') usually speak their native Pashto language, but many of them also use Urdu, Hindi, Persian, English, and other languages of the region for their daily communication purposes. The word ''Pathan'' is usually applied to individuals who reside outside their native land and have mixed with the Indian culture.
