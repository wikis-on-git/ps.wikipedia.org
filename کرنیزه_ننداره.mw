An '''agricultural show''' is a public event showcasing the equipment, animals, sports and recreation associated with [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. The largest comprise a '''livestock show''' (a judged event or display in which [[selective breeding|breeding stock]] is exhibited), a [[trade fair]], competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of [[farmer]]s, [[animal fancy|animal fanciers]], [[cowboy]]s and [[zoologist]]s may be displayed. The terms ''agricultural show'' and ''livestock show'' are sometimes used synonymously.

A '''show''' is the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] term for an annual country [[fair]]. 

==Overview== 
In [[Australia]], the show is an important part of cultural life. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to the all-encompassing '''Royal Shows''' in state capitals, which may run for up to two weeks and combine many elements of an [[amusement park]] with those of an agricultural show. Although increasingly under pressure due to finances and insurance concerns, all main towns have a Show Society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena.

A distinctive feature of Australian shows is the [[showbag]], a themed carry bag of commercial goods.

Competitions commonly included in shows include:
*[[Campdrafting]]
*[[Cooking]]
*[[Stud (animal)|Stud]] and commercial [[livestock]]
*[[Jam]]s and [[preserves]]
*[[Photography]]
*[[Wood chopping]]
*[[Sheaf toss]]ing
*[[Demolition Derby]]
*[[Show jumping]]
*[[Tent pegging]]
*[[Wine]]
*[[Rodeo]]
*[[Arts and crafts]]
*[[Horse show]]
*[[Dog show]]s, including [[sheepdog trial]]s
*[[Cat show]]s

==Field days==
Related to a show is the "[[field day]]", with elements of a [[trade show]] for machinery, equipment and skills required for broadacre farming. Field days typically do not involve livestock, showbags or [[sideshow]]s, but may include events such as [[ploughing]] competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. In some communities in northern England Field Days (or [[Club Days]]) have lost their agricultural character and have become community celebrations.
