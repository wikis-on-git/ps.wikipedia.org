'''جاپان''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 日本, '''Nihon''' or '''Nippon''') is an [[East Asia]]n island [[country]] located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], east of [[China]] and [[Korea]], stretching from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] in the south. It is composed of over 3,000 islands, the largest of which are [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]], [[Honshū]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]]. Most of Japan's islands are mountainous, and many are [[volcano|volcanic]]; the highest peak is [[Mount Fuji]].

The written [[history of Japan]] begins with brief appearances in [[History of China|Chinese history]] texts from the first century CE. However, archaeological research indicates that people were living on the islands of Japan as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic|upper paleolithic]] period. Japanese history has had alternating periods of long isolation punctuated by radical, sometimes revolutionary, influence from the outside world. Its culture today is a mixture of such outside influences and [[Japanese culture|traditional culture]]. 

Japan has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second largest economy]], one of the world's [[G8|leading industrialized nations]] and is member of the [[G8]], [[G4]], [[APEC]] nations and a major economic [[global power]] as sixth largest [[export]]er and [[import]]er. It is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and an elected parliament, called the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], which is one of the oldest legislative bodies in [[Asia]]. Despite its rugged terrain, Japan is one of the most populous and most densely populated countries in the world. Greater [[Tokyo]], with over 30 million residents, is the largest metropolitan area in the world.

The [[kanji|characters]] that make up [[Names of Japan|Japan's name]] literally mean "Land of the Rising Sun", a name that comes from the country's eastward position relative to China.

{{main|د جاپان تاريخ}}

===Pre-history===
{{د جاپان تاريخ}}
[[Archeology|Archaeological]] research indicates that the earliest inhabitants of the [[Japanese Archipelago]] migrated over [[land bridge]]s from [[Northeast Asia]] about 30,000 years ago. Other evidence also suggests that there may have been some migration by sea from [[Southeast Asia]] during a period of general migration toward the [[Pacific Ocean]]. 
[[Image:MiddleJomonVessel.JPG|thumb|left|140px|A Middle [[Jomon]] vessel (3000 to 2000 BC)]]

The first signs of civilization appeared around [[10th millennium BC|10,000 BC]] with the [[Jomon|Jōmon]] culture, characterized by a [[mesolithic]] to [[neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle of pit dwelling and a rudimentary form of [[agriculture]]. [[Weaving]] was still unknown and clothes were often made of [[bark]]. Around that time, however, the Jomon people started to make [[clay]] vessels, [[decorated]] with patterns made by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks (Jōmon means "patterns of plaited cord"). This led to the introduction of the earliest known [[pottery]] in the world.

Many believe that the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], an indigenous people found mostly on the northern island of [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]], are descended from the Jomon and thus represent descendants of the first inhabitants of Japan.

The start of the [[Yayoi]] period around [[300 BC]] marked the influx of new practices such as [[rice]] farming, [[shamanism]] and [[iron]] and [[bronze]]-making brought by migrants from [[Korea]], and most likely [[China]].<ref>"[http://www.bookrags.com/history/worldhistory/yayoi-period-ema-06/ Yayoi Period History Summary]," BookRags.com; Jared Diamond, "[http://www2.gol.com/users/hsmr/Content/East%20Asia/Japan/History/roots.html Japanese Roots]," ''Discover'' 19:6 (June 1998); Thayer Watkins, "[http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/japanorigin.htm The Genetic Origins of the Japanese]"; "[http://cache.britannica.com/eb/article-8481 Shinto - History to 1900]," ''Encyclopædia Britannica''; "[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-23121?query=Yayoi&ct=%20 The Yayoi period (c. 250 BC–c. AD 250)]," ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref> These formed the basic elements of traditional Japanese [[culture]], still seen today. As the population increased and society became more complex, they began to weave cloth, live in permanent farming villages, construct buildings of wood and stone, accumulate wealth through landownership and the storage of grain, and develop distinct social classes.

The ensuing [[Kofun era]], beginning around [[250|AD 250]] and named after the giant burial mounds that were popular at the time, saw the establishment of strong military states centered around powerful clan leaders. The [[Yamato period|Yamato Court]], concentrated in the [[Asuka]] region, suppressed the surrounding clans and acquired agricultural lands, increasing their power. Based upon the Chinese model, they then developed a central administrative and imperial court system and society was organized into occupation groups: farmers, fishermen, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.

===Classical era===
Japan first appeared in written history in 57 AD with the following mention in the [[Eastern Han]] Chronicles of China: "Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] (in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], "Wo" or "''dwarf state''"). Formed from more than one hundred countries, they come and pay tribute frequently." The beginning of historical writing in Japan culminated in the early 8th century with the massive chronicles, [[Kojiki]] (The Record of Ancient Matters, 712) and [[Nihon Shoki]] (Chronicles of Japan, 720). These chronicles give a much different and more legendary tale of Japan's beginnings in which the people are descendants of the gods themselves.

According to the myths contained in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Japan was founded in 660 BC by the ancestral [[Emperor Jimmu]], a direct descendant of the [[Shinto]] deity [[Amaterasu]], or the Sun Goddess. The myths also claim that Jimmu started a line of emperors that remains unbroken to this day. However, historians believe the first emperor who actually existed was [[Emperor Ojin|Emperor Ōjin]], though the date of his reign is uncertain. In any event, for most of Japan's history, the real political power has been in the hands of the [[Sessho and Kampaku|court nobility]], the [[shogun]]s, the military and, more recently, the prime minister.

Starting with the [[Taika Reform Edicts]] of 645, Japanese intensified the adoption of [[Chinese culture|Chinese cultural]] practices and reorganized the government and the penal code in accordance with the Chinese administrative structure (the [[Ritsuryo]] state) of the time. This paved the way for the dominance of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy in Japan until the 19th century.

The use of the word ''Nihon'' (日本) for the emerging state first appeared around the end of the 7th century.  

[[Image:TodaijiDaibutsu0224.jpg|thumb|160px|The Great [[Buddha]] at [[Todaiji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], originally cast in 752]]

The [[Nara period]] of the 8th century marked the first emergence of a strong Japanese state, centered around an imperial court in the city of [[Heijo Palace|Heijo-kyo]] (now [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The imperial court then moved briefly to [[Nagaoka]], and then to Heian-kyō (now [[Kyoto]]). 

A distinctly indigenous culture emerged during the [[Heian period]] which lasted for nearly four centuries. After absorbing so much from the mainland over several centuries, the Japanese began to experience a growing sense of self-confidence and appreciation of their own land and heritage. The [[Japanese art|arts]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]] flourished and, in the early 11th century, [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]] wrote the world's first known novel called ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Although trade expeditions and Buddhist pilgrimages continued, the court decided to discontinue official relations with China.<ref>"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/heia/hd_heia.htm Heian Period]," Metropolitan Museum of Art.</ref> The [[Fujiwara clan]]'s regency regime dominated politics during this period.

===Medieval era===
[[Image:Satsuma-samurai-during-boshin-war-period.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Samurai of the [[Satsuma]] clan, during the [[Boshin War]] period, circa 1867. Photograph by [[Felice Beato]]]]
Japan's [[medieval]] era was characterized by the emergence of a ruling class of [[warrior]]s, the [[buke]] or more commonly known in the West as the [[samurai]] and [[bushi]]. In the year 1185, following the defeat of the rival Taira clan, general [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was declared Seii-tai [[Shogun]] and established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, another warrior clan, the [[Hojo clan|Hojo]], came to rule as regents for the [[shogun]]s. The [[Kamakura shogunate]] managed to repel [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, with assistance from a storm that the Japanese interpreted as divine intervention, and named  [[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]] (Divine Wind). The shogunate lasted another fifty years. Its successor, the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] failed in the management of [[Daimyo]]. Vassals rebelled against their liege lords and peasants rebelled against their superiors. This led to the "Warring States" or [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] period.

During the 16th century, traders and [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[Portugal]] reached Japan for the first time, initiating the ''[[Nanban trade period|Nanban]]'' ("southern barbarian") period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established greater control over the warring states of Japan. Nobunaga died in a treacherous attack by one of his generals whom he had humiliated earlier. Hideyoshi, one of Nobunaga's other generals, avenged his master's death, defeating other rivals and completing the reunification of the country. Hideyoshi launched [[Seven-Year War]]. But [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] China came to Korea's aid and after several defeats and following Hideyoshi's death, Japanese troops were quickly withdrawn in 1598.

[[Image:Map of Japan by Keampfer.jpg|thumb|240px|Map of Japan, end of the 17th century.]]

Ieyasu then dominated the political scene and defeated a coalition of rival clans. He was eventually declared shogun and worked to consolidate the hold of his clan on Japan, setting up the [[Bakuhan taisei]] feudal system and implementing [[Sankin-kotai]] to ensure the loyalty of the vassal lords. After Ieyasu, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] began to pursue the ''[[Sakoku]]'' ("closed country") policy of isolation. Lasting for two and a half centuries, this during a time of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]], often considered to be the height of Japan's medieval culture. The study of Western sciences, known as ''[[Rangaku]]'', continued during this period through contacts with the [[Dutch]] enclave at [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]].

===Modern era===
====Meiji Restoration====
{{main article|Meiji Restoration}}
[[Image:FukuzawaYukichi.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Fukuzawa Yukichi]], c.1860.]]
[[Image:Japanese_Empire2.png|thumb|200px|The Empire of Japan encompassed most of East and Southeast Asia at its height, in 1942]]
On [[March 31]], [[1854]], [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] and the "[[Black Ships]]" of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the West with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. The [[Boshin War]] of 1867 to 1868 led to the resignation of the shogunate, and the [[Meiji Restoration]] established a government centered around the emperor. One of the main figures that helped bring change was [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] who wrote "[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]", encouraging Japan to disassociate itself from China and Korea and modernize through [[Westernization]].

====Imperial Japan====
{{main article|Imperial Japan}}
During the [[Meiji period]], Japan adopted numerous Western institutions, including a modern government, legal system, and military. These reforms helped transform the [[Empire of Japan]] into a world power, defeating [[China]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894-1895) and [[Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905). The Russo-Japanese war is important because it was the first time that an Asian country had defeated a European imperial power. By 1910, Japan controlled [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]]. 

[[Image:Yamatotrials.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], the largest [[battleship]] in history, in 1941.]]
The early 20th century saw a brief period of "[[Taisho democracy]]" overshadowed by the rise of [[Japanese expansionism]]. [[World War I]] enabled Japan, which fought on the side of the victorious [[Allies]], to expand its influence in Asia, and its territorial holdings in the Pacific. In 1936, however, Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], joining Germany and Italy to form the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] alliance. Japan invaded [[China]], occupying [[Manchuria]] in 1931, and continued its expansion into China in 1937, starting the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945), which lasted until the end of [[World War II]]. In 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States naval base]] in [[Pearl Harbor]] and declared war on the Allies, bringing the United States into the war. Japan then invaded and occupied [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and U.S. colonies that now make up the present-day countries of [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]].

[[Image:nagasakibomb.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[atomic bomb]]ing of [[Nagasaki]].]]
After a long campaign in the Pacific Ocean, Japan lost many of its initial territorial gains, and American forces moved close enough to begin [[strategic bombing]] of Tokyo, [[Osaka]], and other major cities including the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]]s of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], killing about 214,000 people, mostly civilians. The Japanese eventually agreed to an [[surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender to the Allies]] on [[August 15]], [[1945]] ([[V-J Day]]). The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]] was convened on [[May 3]][[1946]] to prosecute [[Japanese war crimes]], including atrocities like the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Emperor [[Hirohito]], however, was given immunity and retained his title.

====Modern Japan====
The war cost millions of lives in Japan and other countries, especially in [[East Asia]], and left much of the country's industries and infrastructure destroyed. Official [[Occupied Japan|American occupation]] lasted until 1952, although [[United States Forces Japan|U.S. forces]] still retain important bases in Japan, especially in [[Okinawa]]. In 1947, Japan adopted a new [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]], seeking international cooperation and emphasizing human rights and democratic practices.

After the occupation, under a program of aggressive industrial development and U.S. assistance, Japan achieved spectacular growth to become the second largest economy in the world. Despite a major [[stock market crash]] in 1990 and the resulting [[recession]] from which the country is recovering gradually, Japan remains a global economic power today and is now bidding for a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]].

[[Image:The Diet.jpg|thumb|240|The [[Parliament]] sits in joint session.]]
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Japan}}
In academic studies, Japan is generally considered a [[constitutional monarchy]], based largely upon the British system with strong influences from European continental [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Germany and France. For example, in 1896 the Japanese government established ''Minpo'', the [[Civil Code]], on the French model. With post-World War II modifications, the code remains in effect in present-day Japan.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043364?hook=6804 "Japanese Civil Code"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 14 May 2006.</ref>

===Parliament===
The [[Constitution of Japan]] states that the nation's "highest organ of state power" is its bicameral [[parliament]], the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]] (''Kokkai''). The Diet consists of a [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] (Lower House or ''Shūgi-in'') containing 480 seats, elected by popular vote every 4 years or when dissolved, and a [[House of Councillors]] (Upper House or ''Sangi-in'') of 242 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal adult (over 20 years old) [[suffrage]], with a [[secret ballot]] for all elective offices.

The [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] is composed of a [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] and ministers of state, and is responsible to the Diet. The Prime Minister must be a member of the [[Diet]], and is designated by his colleagues. The Prime Minister has the power to appoint and remove ministers, a majority of whom must be Diet members. The [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) has been in power since 1955, except for a short-lived [[coalition government]] formed from its opposition parties in 1993; the largest opposition party is the liberal-socialist [[Democratic Party of Japan]].

===The Imperial household===
The [[Imperial Household of Japan]] is headed by the Emperor of Japan. The Constitution of Japan defines the [[emperor]] to be "the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people". He performs ceremonial duties and holds no real power; not even emergency [[reserve power]]s. Power is mainly held by the Prime Minister, and other elected members of the [[Diet]]. Sovereignty is vested in the [[Japanese people]] by the constitution. Though his official status is disputed, on diplomatic occasions the emperor tends to behave (with widespread public support, it should be noted) as though he were a [[head of state]]. As of 2006, Japan is the only country in the world with an emperor.

==Foreign relations and military==
{{main articles|[[Foreign relations of Japan]] and [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Military of Japan]]}}
[[Image:koizumi with bush.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] and [[U.S.]] President [[George W. Bush]] meet at the White House.]]
<!--[[Image:JapanTokyoNijubashi.jpg|thumb|The [[Kokyo|Imperial Palace]] in Tokyo is the primary residence of the emperor]]-->
Japan maintains close economic and military ties with its key ally, the [[United States]], and the [[Japanese-American relations|US-Japan security alliance]] serves as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. Japan is a member state of the [[United Nations]] and currently serving as a non-permanent [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] member. It is also one of the "[[G4 nations]]" seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.

As a major economic power, Japan is a member of the [[G8]]. It is also a member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], a part of the "[[ASEAN]] plus three" group, and a participant in the [[East Asia Summit]]. The country is a leader in [[international aid]] and development efforts, donating 0.19% of its [[Gross National Income]] in 2004.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/3/35389786.pdf Net Official Development Assistance In 2004], Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 11 April 2005. Retrieved 14 May 2006. {{PDFlink}}</ref>

Japan's relationship with its neighbors, however, can be described as tenuous at best. It currently has territorial disputes with [[Russia]] over the [[Kuril Island conflict|Kuril Islands]], with [[South Korea]] over [[Dokdo]] (Takeshima), with the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) over the [[Senkaku Islands]] (Diaoyutai Islands), and with the People's Republic of China over the status of [[Okinotori]]. These disputes are in part about the control of marine and natural resources, such as possible reserves of [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]]. 

In recent years, Japan has had an ongoing dispute with [[North Korea]] over its [[North Korean abductions of Japanese|abduction of Japanese citizens]] and [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]].

Japan's military is restricted by [[Article 9]] of the [[Constitution of Japan]] that states that, "The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." Thus, Japan's current constitution prohibits the use of military force to wage war against other countries. 

Japan's military is primarily consisted of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]], the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]], and the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]]. Its military budget is estimated to be the sixth largest in the world at around $48 billion per year. The forces have been recently used [[peacekeeping]] operations and [[Deployment of Japanese troops to Iraq|Japan's recent deployment of non-combat troops to Iraq]] marked the first overseas use of its military since [[World War II]].

[[Image:Satellite image of Japan in May 2003.jpg||thumb|right|200px|Satellite image of Japan]]
{{main|Geography of Japan}}

Japan, a country of [[island]]s, extends along the eastern or [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Asia]]. The main islands, running from north to south, are [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshū|Honshu]] (or the mainland), [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]]. [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]] in the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu]] archipelago is over 600 kilometers (375&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) to the southwest of Kyushu. In addition, about 3,000 smaller islands may be counted in the full extent of the [[archipelago]].

Japan is the 19th [[list of countries by population density|most densely populated country]] in the world. About 70 to 80 percent of the country is forested, [[mountain]]ous <ref>http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566679/Japan.html "Japan," Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2006
http://encarta.msn.com © 1997-2006 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved.</ref><ref>http://www.worldinfozone.com/country.php?country=Japan "Japan Information", © 1997 - 2006 World InfoZone Ltd</ref>,and unsuitable for [[Agriculture|agricultural]], [[Industry|industrial]], or residential use, due to the generally steep elevations, climate, and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground, and heavy rain. This has resulted in an extremely high population density in the habitable zones that are mainly located in coastal areas.

Its location on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], at the juncture of three tectonic plates, gives Japan frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times each century. The most recent major quakes include the [[2004 Chuetsu Earthquake]] and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin Earthquake]] of [[1995]]. [[Onsen|Hot springs]] are numerous, and have been developed as resorts.

The climate of Japan is predominantly [[temperate]] but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones:

*[[Hokkaido]]: The northernmost zone has a temperate climate with long, cold winters and cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snow banks in the winter.
*[[Sea of Japan]]: On Honshu's west coast, the northwest wind in the wintertime brings heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures, due to the [[Föhn wind]] phenomenon.
*[[Chuo-kochi|Central Highlands]]: A typical inland climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night. Precipitation is light.
*[[Inland Sea|Seto Inland Sea]]: The mountains of the [[Chugoku region|Chugoku]] and [[Shikoku]] regions shelter the region from the seasonal winds, bringing mild weather throughout the year.
*Pacific Ocean: The east coast experiences cold winters with little snowfall and hot, humid summers due to the southeast seasonal wind.
*[[Ryukyu Islands|Southwest Islands]]: The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. [[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are common.

The main [[Monsoon|rainy season]] begins in early May in Okinawa, and the stationary rain front responsible for this gradually works its way north until it dissipates in northern Japan before reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early [[autumn]], [[typhoon]]s often bring heavy rain.

Japan is home to nine forest [[Ecoregions of Japan|ecoregions]] which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] in the Ryukyu and Bonin islands, to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to [[temperate coniferous forests]] in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.

The prefectures are further subdivided into [[cities of Japan|cities]], [[towns of Japan|towns]] and [[villages of Japan|villages]]. The nomenclature is different in the [[Tokyo City|former city of Tokyo]], which is divided into 23 cities known as the [[23 special wards|special wards]] (the part of Tokyo outside the 23 special wards uses the nationwide terminology for cities, towns, and villages). Cities (including special wards of Tokyo), towns, and villages have elected officials. In addition, major cities are divided into [[wards of Japan|wards]]. These wards, however, are not corporate entities. 

Japan is currently undergoing administrative [[Merger and dissolution of municipalities of Japan|reorganization]] by merging many of the cities, towns, and villages with each other. This process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions, and is expected to cut administrative costs.<ref>http://siteresources.worldbank.org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/WBI/Resources/wbi37175.pdf Mabuchi, Masaru, "Municipal Amalgamation in Japan," World Bank, 2001.</ref> The Japanese government is also considering a plan by which several groups of prefectures would merge, creating a sub-national administrative division system consisting of 9, 11, or 13 states, and giving the states more local autonomy than the current prefectures enjoy.<ref>http://www.nira.go.jp/publ/seiken/ev18n10/ev18n10-s.html "''Doshusei'' Regional System," National Association for Research Advancement</ref>

{{main|Economy of Japan}}

Japan is a major economic [[global power]] with [[free-market economy]]. Government-industry cooperation, a strong [[work ethic]], mastery of [[High tech|high technology]], and a comparatively small [[Defense budget of Japan|defense allocation]] have helped Japan advance with extraordinary speed to become one of the largest economies in the world. For three decades, overall real economic growth [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|had been spectacular]]: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html</ref> Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s largely due to the after-effects of over-investment during the late 1980s and domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Government efforts to revive economic growth have met with little success and were further hampered in 2000 to 2001 by the slowing of the global economy.<ref>http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html "Japan Economy", CIA World Factbook</ref> 

However, the economy saw signs of strong recovery in 2005. GDP growth for the year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rate of the US and European Union during the same period.<ref>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HC02Dh01.html</ref> Unlike previous recovery trends, domestic consumption has been the dominant factor in leading the growth. Hence, the Japanese government predicts that recovery will continue in 2006. 

Distinguishing characteristics of the Japanese economy include the cooperation of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks in closely-knit groups called [[keiretsu]]; the powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shunto|shuntō]]''; cozy relations with government bureaucrats, and the guarantee of lifetime employment (''shushin koyo'') in big corporations and highly [[labour union|unionized]] [[blue-collar]] factories. Recently, Japanese companies have begun to abandon some of these norms in an attempt to increase profitability.

The current government of [[Junichiro Koizumi]] has enacted or attempted to pass (sometimes with failure) major privatization and foreign-investment laws intended to help stimulate Japan's dormant economy. Although the effectiveness of these laws is still ambiguous, the economy has begun to respond, but Japan's aging population is expected to place further strain on growth in the near future.<ref>"[http://www.btinternet.com/~pae_news/review/issue23.htm Japan, Refutation of Neoliberalism]", ''Post-Autistic Economics Network'', 5 January 2004. Retrieved 14 May 2006.</ref>

[[heterodox economics|Heterodox economists]] tend to claim that Japan is far stronger economically than is usually appreciated [http://www.btinternet.com/~pae_news/review/issue23.htm]. Some mainstream economists acknowledge that Japan, which unlike most other Western countries has maintained its industrial base, and has vast capital reserves, currently has a strong economic outlook.

===Exports===
[[Image:Tokyoskyline.jpg|360px|right|thumbnail|Tokyo is Japan's financial center]]
Exporting of goods is an essential part of the Japanese economy. Its main export partners are: [[US]] 22.7%, [[China]] 13.1%, [[South Korea]] 7.8%, [[Taiwan]] 7.4%, [[Hong Kong]] 6.3% (as of 2004)

Japan's main exports:

===Industrial sector===
Japan is among world's largest and technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronic equipment, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical, textiles, and processed foods and is home to some of the largest and most well-known [[multinational corporation]]s and commercial [[brand]]s. It's also one of the leading research nations in these sectors.

Japan holds a very large market share in [[high-technology]] industries such as [[semiconductor]]s, industrial chemicals, machine tools, [[media]] and (in recent years) [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]]. [[Construction]] has long been one of Japan's largest industries, with the help of multi-billion-dollar government contracts in the civil sector. These industries make Japan a major economic [[global power]]. [[Robot|Robotics]] constitutes a key long-term economic strength. There are very few, or if any countries in the world that matches Japan in production of [[high technology]] electronic products. Main power of Japan in the industrial sector are [[automobile]] (machinery) and electronics sectors.

====Automobile====
[[Image:GS-523_lg.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Japanese car]]
Japan hold's large share in automobile and electrical machinery manufactering with home to some of the large automobile manufacturers such as [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], [[Honda|Honda Motor Company]], [[Nissan|Nissan Motor Company]], [[Suzuki|Suzuki Motor Corporation]], [[Mazda|Mazda Motor Corporation]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], [[Komatsu|Komatsu, Ltd.]], [[Hitachi|Hitachi Heavy Industries]], [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi Motors Corporation]], [[Yamaha Corporation]], [[Isuzu| Isuzu Motors, Ltd.]]. Some of these companies crossover to different sectors such as [[electronics]] to produce electronic equipment as some of them being a part of [[keiretsu]]. Japan's automobiles are generally known for their [[quality]], durability, [[fuel]] efficiency and more [[feature]]s with relatively cheaper price than other competitors.

====Electronics====
[[Image:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|right|150px|thumbnail|[[ASIMO]] [[robot]] at [[Expo 2005]] in Japan.]]
Japan is among the leading, largest and technologically advanced producers of [[semiconductor]] (electronics) and holds a very large market share in the [[world]] with home to companies such as, most of them are [[multinational corporation]]s. Japan's electronic products are known for their [[quality]], durability and technological sophistication. Some of Japan's electronics companies are, some of them crossing over to automobile and finance sectors as being a part of [[keiretsu]] are [[Sharp Corporation]], [[Yamaha Corporation]], [[Sony Corporation]], [[Matsushita|Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,Ltd.]], [[NEC Corporation]], [[Toshiba Corporation]], [[Nintendo|Nintendo Company Limited]], [[Epson|Seiko Epson Corporation]], [[JVC|JVC Ltd.]], [[Bridgestone|Bridgestone Corporation]], [[Casio|Casio Computer Co., Ltd.]], [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd]], [[Fujitsu|Fujtisu Ltd.]], [[Olympus Corporation]], [[Korg|Korg Corporation]], [[Sanyo|Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd]], [[Roland Corporation]], and [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi Electronics, Ltd.]], [[Nikon Corporation]] and [[Canon Inc.]] with many of them [[household name]] in the electronics sector. {{seealso|List of Japanese companies}}

===Science and technology===
[[Image:JAXAlogo.gif|180px|left|thumb|[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]].]]
Japan is a leading nation in scientific research and the production of innovative technological products. Some of the most important industrial contributions include [[chemical]]s, [[electronics]], [[entertainment]], and [[optics]]. It is also one of the leading nations in [[health care]] and [[medicine|medical]] research. 

Japan is making headway into [[aerospace]] research and exploration. It has its own [[aerospace]] exploration agency, [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] that was founded in [[October 1]], [[2003]] and is involved in many missions and projects and a possible independent [[manned mission]] to the [[moon]] having shifted some of its focus away from [[international]] efforts beginning [[2005]].

===Service sector===
[[Image:Tokyo stock exchange.gif|thumb|right|[[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] is the second largest in the world by monetary volume.]] 

Japan's service sector accounts for about three-fourths of its total economic output. [[Bank|Banking]], [[insurance]], [[real estate]], [[Retailer|retail]]ing, [[transportation in Japan|transportation]], and [[telecommunication]]s are all major industries such as [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group|Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.]], [[Toyota|Toyota Financial Group, Inc.]], [[Nomura Group|Nomura Group, Inc.]], [[Mizuho Financial Group|Mizihu Financial Group, Inc.]], [[Japan Post]], [[All Nippon Airways|All Nippon Airways Co.,Ltd.]], [[NTT DoCoMo|Nippon Tel & Tel (NTT DoCoMo)]] counting as one of the largest companies in the world. The [[Junichiro Koizumi|Koizumi]] government is attempting to privatize [[Japan Post and Postal Services Agency|Japan Post]], [[The Tokyo Electric Power Company]], one of the country's largest providers of savings and insurance services by 2007.

===Agricultural sector===
{{main|Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan}}
[[Image:Suburban_Rice_Fields.jpg|thumb|Suburban rice fields.]]
Japan uses a system of terrace farming to build in a small area due to lack of available land. Japanese agriculture has one of the world's highest levels of productivity per unit area. Japan's small [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. 

Imported [[rice]], the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 490% and restricted to a quota of only 7.2% of average rice consumption in between 1968 and 1988 Imports beyond the quota are unrestricted in legal terms, but subject to a 341 yen per kilogram tariff. This tariff is now estimated at 490%, but the rate will soar to a massive 778% under new calculation rules to be introduced as part of the [[Doha Round]].<ref>"http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=2378"</ref> Although Japan is usually self-sufficient in rice (except for its use in making rice crackers and processed foods), the country must import about 50% <ref>"http://www.skillclear.co.uk/japan/default.asp"</ref> of its requirements of other [[Cereal|grain]] and fodder crops, and relies on imports for most of its supply of [[meat]]. 

Japan maintains one of the world's largest [[fishing]] fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch <ref>"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html#Econ"</ref>, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in [[fish]] stocks such as [[tuna]].<ref>"http://www.atimes.com/oceania/AH31Ah01.html"</ref> Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial [[whaling in Japan|whaling]].<ref>"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4118990.stm"</ref>

===Infrastructure===
Japan is unique in that its [[electric power transmission]] runs at different [[frequency|frequencies]] in  different parts of the country - 50 [[Hertz|Hz]] in Tokyo and elsewhere east of the [[Fuji River]], 60 Hz in Osaka and other parts west. It has 1,177,278 [[km]] paved roadways, 173 [[airport]]s, and 23,577 [[km]] [[railway]]s as of 2004.

==Society==
===Demographics===
[[Image:Shibuya tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Shibuya Crossing is one of the largest pedestrian crossings and shopping areas.]]  
{{mainarticle|Demographics of Japan}}

Japanese society is [[Linguistics|linguistically]], though not ethnically, homogeneous with small populations of primarily [[Ryukyuans]] (1.5 million), North and South [[Koreans]] (0.6 million), [[China|Chinese]] and [[Taiwan]]ese (0.5 million), [[Philippines|Filipino]]s (0.5 million), and [[Brazil]]ians (250,000). Japan has indigenous minority groups such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuans]], and social minority group like ''[[burakumin]]''. Japanese [[citizenship]] is conferred ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and monolingual Japanese-speaking minorities often reside in Japan for generations under permanent residency status without acquiring citizenship in their country of birth. About 99% of the population speaks [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as their first language.

Japan has the highest [[life expectancy]] in the world: 85.2 years for women and 78.3 years for men in 2002.<ref>[http://unstats.un.org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYB2003/Table04.pdf Vital statistics summary and expectation of life at birth: 1999-2003], United Nations Statistics Division. Retrieved 14 May 2006. {{PDFlink}}</ref> However, the Japanese population is rapidly aging, the effect of [[Post-WW2 baby boom|a postwar baby boom]] followed by a decrease in births in the latter part of the 20th century. In 2004, about 19.5% of the population was over the age of 65.<ref>"http://www.stat.go.jp/English/data/handbook/c02cont.htm"</ref> The changes in the demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in the workforce population and increases in the cost of social securities like the [[pension|public pension plan]].

Retrieved 14 May 2006.</ref> [[Immigration]] and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a possible solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Immigration, however, is not publicly popular as recent increased [[crime]] rates are often attributed to foreigners living in Japan.

===مذهب===
[[Image:Itsukushima torii angle.jpg|thumb|185px|A [[torii]] at [[Itsukushima Shrine]]. [[Shinto]] is [[folk religion|native religion]] of Japan]]
{{main articles|[[Religion in Japan]]}} 

The Japanese people's concern towards religion is mostly related to [[mythology]], [[traditions]], and neighborhood activities rather than the source of morality or the guideline for one's life, for which sometimes [[Confucianism]], or even [[Taoism]], tends to serve as the basis for the moral code. When asked to identify their religion, most (84%) would profess to believe both [[Shintoism]] and [[Buddhism]] according to the [[CIA World Factbook]]. This is for simple reasons; like their family has belonged to some sect of Buddhism or to avoid contention with religious foreigners. Nonetheless, most of the people are not [[atheist]]s, and the tendency is often identified with [[syncretism]], [[secularism]], and even [[irreligion]]. This results in a variety of practices such as parents and children celebrating [[Shinto]] rituals, students praying before exams, couples holding a wedding at a [[Christian]] church and funerals being held at [[Buddhist]] temples. A minority profess to [[Christianity]] (0.7%) and other religions (4.7%) like [[shamanism]], [[Islam]], and [[Hinduism in Japan|Hinduism]]. Also, since the mid-19th century, many religious sects called ''shinkoshukyo'', and later ''[[shinshukyo]]'', emerged.

===Education===
[[image:Tokyo University Akamon 2004-11-16.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Akamon'' (Red Gate) at the [[University of Tokyo]].]] 
{{main|Education in Japan}}
Compulsory education was introduced into Japan in 1872 as one result of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Since 1947, compulsory education consists of [[elementary school]] and [[middle school]], which lasts for 9 years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior [[high school]], and 96% of high school graduates attend a [[university]], [[junior college]], trade school, or other post-secondary institution.

===Public health===
{{main article|Health care in Japan}}   
In Japan, healthcare services are provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice. 

===ژبې===
{{main|Japanese language}}
[[Image:Nihongo.png|right|80px|thumb|日本語 (Japanese language)]]

The [[Japanese language]] is an [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] language distinguished by a system of [[Japanese honorifics|honorifics]] reflecting the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]   nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary which indicate the relative status of speaker and listener. There is no consensus on what, if any, relationship Japanese has with other languages, but scholars continue to [[Japanese language classification|research]] the issue.

Japanese incorporates many foreign elements. Much as [[English language|English]] has borrowed learned vocabulary from [[Latin language|Latin]], Japanese has borrowed or derived significant amounts of vocabulary from [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. When foreign words are written in Japanese, they are usually done so in a separate alphabet called [[katakana]]. Japanese also has extensive borrowings from  [[English language|English]]. The [[Japanese writing system|writing system]] uses [[kanji]] ([[Chinese character]]s) and two sets of [[kana]] ([[syllabary|syllabaries]] based on simplified forms of Chinese characters), as well as the [[Roman alphabet]] and [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]. 

Japan's official language is Japanese, and about 99% of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. The [[Ryukyuan languages]], the other member of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic language family]], are spoken in [[Okinawa]], but few children are learning these languages now. [[Ainu language|Ainu]], the language of the indigenous minority, is moribund, with only a few elderly [[First language|native speakers]] remaining in [[Hokkaido]]. Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English.

Japanese [[culture]] has evolved greatly over the years, from the country's original [[Jomon]] culture to its contemporary hybrid culture, which combines influences from [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]].

Historically, [[China]] has been the most influential starting with the development of the [[Yayoi]] culture from around 300&nbsp;BC and culminating with the introduction of rice farming, ceremonial burial, pottery, painting, writing, poetry, etiquette, the [[Chinese written language|Chinese writing system]], and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] by the 7th century AD. 

[[Image:Cowboy bebop01.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Anime]] is popular in Japan and certain degree around the world.]]
Beginning in the Heian period, Japan developed a distinct culture of its own. [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written in the early 11th century, is the world's first known novel. Japanese civilization flourished during this time and a refined sensibility and interest in the arts began to set in. Traditional [[Japanese Art|Japanese arts]] include: [[Japanese crafts|crafts]] ([[ikebana]], [[origami]], [[ukiyo-e]], [[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]], [[Lacquer|lacquerware]], [[Japanese pottery|pottery]]), performances ([[bunraku]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[rakugo]]), traditions ([[List of Japanese games|games]], [[onsen]], [[sento]], [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[budo]], [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], [[Japanese garden|gardens]], [[Katana|swords]]), and [[Cuisine of Japan|cuisine]] ([[donburi]], [[mochi]], [[ramen]], [[sushi]], [[tempura]], [[udon]]). Short Poetic ([[haiku]] , [[Tanka]])

From the mid-19th [[century]] onward, Western influence prevailed, with American influence becoming especially predominant following the end of [[World War II]]. This influence is apparent in Japan's contemporary popular culture, which combines Asian, European, and, 1950-onward, American influences. 

Today, Japan is a major [[exporter]] of its own [[popular culture]], which has gained popularity around the world, particularly in other East Asian countries and some areas of the United States. Many Japanese have also achieved international acclaim in [[fashion]], [[Cinema of Japan|film]], [[Japanese literature|literature]], [[Japanese television programs|television]], and [[Music of Japan|music]]. Two Japanese writers have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Emerging and growing trends in Japanese culture include some of the highest-quality [[video game]]s and [[game console]]s, as well as a wide variety of [[graphic novels]] ([[manga]]) and [[animated films]] ([[anime]]) with distinctive artistic styles imitated the world over. As a result, many aspects of Japanese popular culture have attracted many devotees in Europe and North America.

===Sports and recreation===
[[Image:JapanSumoMatch.jpg|thumb|[[Sumo]] is a traditional Japanese sport]]
{{main|Sports in Japan}}

[[Sumo]] is considered Japan's [[national sport]] and is one of its most popular. In the 8th century AD, [[Emperor Shomu]] (724-749) held lavish tournaments where the best wrestlers in the country competed before hundreds. Professional sumo can trace its roots back to the Edo period as a form of sporting entertainment. Today, six major tournaments are held every year in Japan, each one lasting 15 days. Three are held in Tokyo (January, May, and September) and one each in Osaka (March), Nagoya (July), and Fukuoka (November). The highest rank for a wrestler in sumo is ''[[yokozuna]].''

Beginning in the 12th century, Japan developed traditional [[martial arts]] known as [[budo]], which were popular among the warrior class. These include [[judo]], [[karate]], [[kendo]], and others. Judo has been recognized as an official event in the [[Olympic Games]] since the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo. It is also one of the four main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally today.

After the Meiji Restoration, various kinds of Western sports were introduced into Japan. [[Baseball]] arrived in 1872 and during the 1870s, [[Athletics|track and field]] events, [[football]], [[rugby]], and [[ice skating]] were introduced. In 1911, an [[Austria]]n gave [[skiing]] instruction to the Japanese army. In those days, Western sports were played by few people, but through the educational system they spread throughout the country. Western sports were initially stressed as a form of mental discipline, but Japanese have now come to enjoy them as recreational activities.<ref>http://web-japan.org/factsheet/sports/index.html</ref>

Today, baseball is the most popular spectator sport in Japan, followed by (in no particular order) football, rugby, [[golf]], [[badminton]], [[table tennis]], [[car racing]], and [[fishing]]. [[Automobile]] racing is also popular in Japan with [[Super GT]] sports car series and [[Formula Nippon]] formula racing.

Japanese board games include a form of chess, known as [[shogi]]. [[Go]] is also widely popular in the country.  

Each year, Japan observes the second Monday in October as a national holiday called [[Health and Sports Day]]. The date, originally October 10, commemorates the opening day of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo. Other major sporting events that Japan has hosted include the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo, Hokkaido|Sapporo]] and the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]]. It also co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] with [[South Korea]].
