The '''Philippines''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pilipinas''), officially the '''Republic of the Philippines''' (''Republika ng Pilipinas''), is an [[island nation]] located in the [[Malay archipelago]] in [[Southeast Asia]], with [[Manila]] as its capital. It comprises 7,107 islands called the Philippine Archipelago, with a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers or 116,000 square miles.

The people of the Philippines are called Filipinos.  Most Filipinos are descended from the indigenous [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian-speaking peoples]], but there are also some Filipinos of mixed descent, known as mestizos, through intermarriage with the Chinese, Spanish or other nationalities.

The country was named "Las Islas Felipenas" by [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] after [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]]. A Spanish colonial rule through [[Mexico]] began in 1565 and lasted for about three centuries until the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896.  The United States gained possession of the Philippines after the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898 and ruled the country for about five decades. Philippine culture has many affinities with the [[Western world|West]].  [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion, and [[English]] is an official language, along with [[Tagalog]].

The Philippines is a significant source of migrant workers; there are over 9 million [[overseas Filipinos]] and their remittances exceed $12 billion a year, an amount that forms a significant portion of the Philippines' [[gross national product]]. Moreover, the country exports more than one million of its nationals abroad annually through its overseas employment program.

{{main|History of the Philippines}}
[[Archeology|Archeological]] and [[paleontology|paleontological]] evidence suggests that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' existed in [[Palawan]] about 50,000 years ago. An [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]-speaking people settled in the Philippines and maintained a maritime trading network with the rest of Southeast Asia as early as 5,000 B.C.E.  

[[Ferdinand Magellan]] (Fernando Magallanes in Spanish) was the first European to visit the archipelago, arriving in [[1521]]. [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] arrived in [[1565]] and formed the first Spanish settlements, and paved the way for colonization. Roman Catholic missionaries converted most of the inhabitants. In the next 300 years, the Spanish military fought off various local indigenous revolts and various external colonial challenges. Such challenges came from the British, Chinese, Dutch, French, Japanese, and Portuguese. The most significant loss for Spain was the temporary occupation of the capital by the British during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The Philippines was ruled as a territory of [[New Spain]] from 1565 to 1821, before it was administered directly from Spain. [[Manila Galleon]] began in the late 16th century. The Philippines opened itself to world trade on [[September 6]], [[1834]]. A propaganda movement began in the Spanish mainland, which included [[José Rizal]]. This was done in order to inform the government of the injustices of the administration in the Philippines as well as the abuses of the friars. In the 1880s and the 1890s, the propagandists clamored for political and social reforms, which included demands for greater representation in Spain. Unable to gain the reforms, Rizal returned to the country, and pushed for the reforms locally. Rizal was subsequently arrested, tried, and executed for sedition on [[December 30]], [[1896]]. Earlier that year, the [[Katipunan]], led by [[Andrés Bonifacio]] already started a revolution, which was eventually continued by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], who established a revolutionary government, although the Spanish governor general [[Fernando Primo de Rivera]] proclaimed the revolution was over in May 17, 1897. 

The [[Spanish-American War]] began in [[1898]] and reached the Philippines when Commodore [[George Dewey]] defeated the Spanish squadron at the [[Battle of Manila Bay|Manila Bay]]. Aguinaldo declared the independence of the Philippines on [[June 12]], [[1898]], and was proclaimed head of state. Spain ceded the Philippines, together with [[Cuba]], [[Guam]] and [[Puerto Rico]] to the United States. By 1899, the [[Philippine-American War]] ensued between the two, which continued the violence of the previous years. That war ended when Aguinaldo was captured by American troops on [[March 23]], [[1901]]. The colonial administration of the Americans introduced democracy in the Philippines. The status was turned into that of a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|commonwealth]] in [[1935]], which provided for more self-governance. Plans for independence in the next decade were underway, although this was interrupted by [[World War II]], when [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] invaded the country. Independence was granted on [[July 4]], [[1946]].

Since 1946, the newly independent Philippine state has faced some economic and political instability. There were also various rebel groups. The Philippines took part in the [[Korean War]] as an ally of South Korea and the United States. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rise of student activism. By this time, [[Ferdinand Marcos]] was elected president. This period was marred by civil unrest. Disbarred from seeking a third term, Marcos declared martial law on [[September 21]], [[1972]], and ruled the country by decree, and extended both his power and tenure by force. His authoritarian rule became marred with unmitigated, pervasive corruption, cronyism and despotism. In 1981, martial law was lifted, but Marcos remained as president after an [[Philippine general election, 1981|election in 1981]].

Opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was assassinated on [[August 21]], [[1983]] upon returning from exile. In January 1986, Marcos allowed for [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|"snap" elections]], after large protests. The election was believed to be fraudulent, and resulted in a standoff between military mutineers and the military loyalists. Protesters supported the mutineers, and was accompanied by resignations of prominent cabinet officials. [[Corazon Aquino]], the recognized winner of the snap election, took over government, and drafted a new constitution, after the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]]. Marcos, his family, and along with some of his allies were exiled to Hawaii.

The return of democracy and government reforms after the events of 1986 was hampered by massive national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, a communist insurgency, and a Muslim separatist movement. The economy improved during the administration of [[Fidel V. Ramos]], who was elected in 1992. However, the economic improvements were negated at the onset of the [[East Asian financial crisis]] in 1997. The [[2001 EDSA Revolution]] led to the downfall of the following president, [[Joseph Estrada]]. The current administration of president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] has been hounded by allegations of corruption and [[Hello Garci scandal|election rigging]].

The government of the Philippines is organized as a [[President|presidential]]-[[Unitary state|unitary]] [[republic]], where the [[President of the Philippines|President]] functions as [[head of state]], the [[head of government]], and the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of the Philippines|armed forces]]. The president is elected by popular vote to a 6-year term, during which he or she appoints and presides over the [[cabinet]] of secretaries.

The [[bicameral]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] comprises the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]; members of the former are elected at large and those of the latter by geographical district. The 24 senators serve 6-year terms, with half retiring every three years, while the House of Representatives comprises 250 members serving 3-year terms.

The [[judiciary|judicial]] branch of government is headed by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], with a [[Chief Justice]] as its head and 14 associate justices, all appointed by the President from nominations submitted by the [[Judicial and Bar Council]]. Other courts include the Court of Appeals, the Regional Trial Courts and the Metropolitan Trial Courts.

[[دوتنه:Vp2flofficial.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Noli de Castro, the current Vice President.]]
As of June 2006 President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is hoping to get agreement to amend the constitution to a [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] under a [[federal republic|federal]] setting similar to the German constitution. The country would be split into "states" with each one having a local legislature responsibility for certain functions. Included in the amendments are plans to remove/ease the current ban on foreign ownership of property, land and commercial organizations in the Philippines.  Plans have been announced to decentralize government by moving departments from Manila to the provinces, such as the Department of Tourism to Cebú City, the Department of Foreign Affairs to Angeles City, and the Department of Agrarian Reform to Iloílo City.

The Philippines is a founding and active member of the [[United Nations]] since its inception on [[October 24]] [[1945]] and is a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). The Philippines is also a member of the [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS), an active player in the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), the [[Latin Union]] and a member of the [[Group of 24]]. The country is a [[major non-NATO ally]] of the U.S., but also a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The Philippines, along with the nation of [[Malta]], is one of two nations in the world where all civil marriages are for life, because civil divorce is banned.

The Philippines is currently in a dispute with [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Malaysia]] over the [[Petroleum|oil]]- and [[natural gas]]-rich [[Spratly Islands]] and [[Scarborough Shoal]], and with Malaysia over [[Sabah]]. The Sultan of [[Sulu]], who received Sabah as a gift in 1703 having helped the Sultan of [[Brunei]] defeat a rebellion, has given the Philippine Government power to reclaim his lost territory. To this day, the [[Sultan of Sulu]]'s family receives "rental" payments for Sabah from the Malaysian government.

{{main|Subdivisions of the Philippines}}
[[دوتنه:Ph regions and provinces.png|250px|thumb|Provinces and regions of the Philippines]]
The Philippines is divided into a hierarchy of local government units (LGUs) with the 79 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] as the primary unit. Provinces are further subdivided into [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] and [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], which are in turn composed of [[barangay]]s. The barangay is the smallest local government unit.

The Philippines is divided into 17 regions with all provinces grouped into one of 16 [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]] for administrative convenience. The [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] however, is divided into four special districts.

Most government offices establish regional offices to serve the constituent provinces. The regions themselves do not possess a separate local government, with the exception of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].

On [[July 24]], [[2006]], the [[State of the Nation Address]] of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Arroyo]]<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/news/default.asp?i=15725 2006 State of the Nation Address of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo : Philippines : Gov.Ph :] – State of the Nation Address of President Arroyo</ref> announced the proposal to create 5 economic [[Super regions of the Philippines|super regions]] in order to concentrate on the economic strengths in a specific area.

{{main|Geography of the Philippines}}
[[دوتنه:Ph physical map.png|250px|thumb|right|Geography of the Philippines]]
The Philippines constitutes an [[archipelago]] of 7,107 islands with a total land area of approximately 300,000 [[square kilometre]]s (116,000&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]). It lies between 116° 40' and 126° 34' E. longitude, and 4° 40' and 21° 10' N. latitude, and borders the [[Philippine Sea]] on the east, on the [[South China Sea]] the west, and the [[Celebes Sea]] on the south. The island of [[Borneo]] lies a few hundred kilometers southwest and [[Taiwan]] directly north. The [[Moluccas]] and [[Sulawesi]] are to the south, and [[Palau]] is to the east beyond the [[Philippine Sea]].

The islands are commonly divided into three island groups: [[Luzon]] (Regions I to V, NCR and CAR), [[Visayas]] (VI to VIII), and [[Mindanao]] (IX to XIII and ARMM). The busy port of [[Manila]], on [[Luzon]], is the national [[capital]] and second largest [[city]] after its suburb [[Quezon City]].

The local [[climate]] is hot, humid, and tropical. The average yearly temperature is around 26.5°[[Celsius|C]] (79.7°[[Fahrenheit|F]]). There are three recognized seasons: ''Tag-init'' or ''Tag-araw'' (the hot season or summer from March to May), ''Tag-ulan'' (the rainy season from June to November), and ''Taglamig'' (the cold season from December to February). The southwest [[monsoon]] (May-October) is known as the "habagat" and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon (November-April) as the "amihan".

Most of the mountainous islands used to be covered in [[tropical rainforest]] and are volcanic in origin. The highest point is [[Mount Apo]] on Mindanao at 2,954 metres (9,692 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). There are many active [[volcano]]s such as [[Mayon Volcano]], [[Mount Pinatubo]], and [[Taal Volcano]]. The country also lies within the [[typhoon]] belt of the Western Pacific and about 19 typhoons strike per year.

Lying on the northwestern fringes of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], the Philippines experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activities. Some 20 [[earthquake]]s are registered daily in the Philippines, though most are too weak to be felt. The last great earthquake was the [[1990 Luzon earthquake]]

The longest river is the [[Cagayan River]] of northern Luzon. The nearly circular [[Manila Bay]], is connected to the [[Laguna de Bay]] by means of the [[Pasig River]]. [[Subic Bay]], the [[Davao Gulf]] and the [[Moro Gulf]] are some of the important bays. Transversing the [[San Juanico Strait]] is the [[San Juanico Bridge]], that connects the islands of [[Samar (island)|Samar]] and [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]].

{{main|Economy of the Philippines}}

The Philippines is a [[developing country]] with an agricultural base, light industry, and service-sector economy.  The Philippines has one of the most vibrant [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO) industries in Asia.  Numerous [[call centers]] and BPO firms have infused momentum into the Philippine market, generating thousands of jobs, including [[Fortune 500]] companies. 

The resiliency of the Philippine economy due to low foreign inflows and an agriculture-based economy allowed it to snap back from international crises as evidenced by 3 percent growth in 1999 and accelerated to 4 percent in 2000.  By 2004, the Philippine economy catapulted to over 6 percent growth after the [[East Asian financial crisis]] of the late 1990s. 

Government initiatives are designed to match the pace of development in the [[newly industrialized countries]] (NICs) of [[East Asia]]. Economic strategies are implemented to manage a public debt comprising 93 percent of the GDP. This priority manifests as a budget allocation set higher than the budget for education and defense combined. The Philippine middle class is essential to economic prosperity. Although proportionately smaller, the Philippine middle class is scheduled to grow.

Strategies for streamlining the economy include improvements of [[infrastructure]], more efficient [[tax]] systems to bolster government revenues, furthering deregulation and [[privatisation]] of the economy, and increasing trade integration within the region and across the world.

On November 1, 2005, a newly expanded [[value added tax]] (E-VAT) law was instituted as a measure to bridle the rising foreign debt and to improve government services such as education, healthcare, social security, and transportation. As of 2006, The Philippines' economic prosperity also depends in large part on how well its two biggest trading partners' economies perform: the U.S. and Japan.

The Philippines is a member of the [[Asian Development Bank]], [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], and other international economic associations, such as the [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Colombo Plan]], and the [[Group of 77|G-77]].

In 2005, the [[Philippine peso]] was said to be Asia's best-performing currency.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rp.html Philippines] [[CIA World Factbook]]. Accessed August 23, 2006</ref> The Philippines' 1st quarter GDP growth was within the government's programmed growth of 5.5% buoyed by the rebound of the agriculture sector and a strong service sector performance however, the economy is still vulnerable to high world oil prices and political instability. There are few promising developments though: one is the strong fiscal performance that the government has put in place; another is the mining boom, which will help generate additional revenues and additional jobs but may permanently damage the environment. The country’s export rose by more than 15 percent in January-April this year, while investments increased by $2 billion over that of the same four-month period last year.

Despite the growing economy, the Philippines will have to address several chronic problems in the future. Income inequality remains persistent; about 30 million people lived on less than $2 per day in 2005. China and India have emerged as major economic competitors, siphoning away investors who would otherwise have invested in the Philippines, particularly telecom companies. Regional development is also somewhat uneven, with the main island Luzon and Metro Manila gaining most of the new economic growth at the expense of the other regions.

{{main|Demographics of the Philippines|Filipino people}} 

The Philippines is the world's 12th most populous country, with a population of over 89 million as of 2006<ref>[http://www.census.gov.ph/data/sectordata/popprojtab.html National Statistics Office — Population Projections]</ref>. Roughly two-thirds reside on the island of [[Luzon]]. Manila, the capital, is the eleventh most populous metropolitan area in the world. The literacy rate was 92.5% in 2003<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf United Nations Human Development Report 2005, p.259]</ref>, and about equal for males and females<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rp.html#People CIA World Factbook - Updated July 20 2006]</ref>. Life expectancy is 69.91 years, with 72.28 years for females and 66.44 years for males. Population growth per year is about 1.92 percent, with 26.3 births per 1,000 people. In the 100 years since the 1903 Census, the population has grown by a factor of eleven. This represents a much faster rate of growth than other countries in the region (Indonesia has grown five-fold over the same period).

{{main|Ethnic groups of the Philippines}}

The people of the Philippines are called [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. Most Filipinos are descended from the various [[Austronesian]]-speaking [[migrants]] who arrived in successive waves over a thousand years ago from [[Southeast Asia]]. These ethnic Filipinos are divided into various [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups, the three most numerous being the Visayans, Tagalogs, and the Ilocanos.  They are genetically closely related to the [[Taiwanese aborigines]], [[Malay people|Malays]] of [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], and the [[Polynesia]]ns.  The [[Negritos]] or [[Aeta]]s are the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines, and number less than 30,000 people (0.03 percent).

[[Filipino mestizo]]s, or persons of mixed indigenous heritage and Spanish or other foreign ancestry form a tiny but economically and politically important minority. A [[Stanford University]] ''small-in'' study, concluded that about 3.6 percent of all Filipinos have some [[European]] genes.

Other significant minorities include the [[Filipino Chinese|ethnic Chinese]], the [[Americans in the Philippines|Americans]], and the [[South Asians in the Philippines|South Asians]].

{{main|Languages of the Philippines}}

More than 170 languages are spoken in the country, almost all of them belonging to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Western Malayo-Polynesian language]] group of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. According to the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], heavily based on Tagalog, and [[English language|English]] are both the official languages. 

The twelve major regional languages are auxiliary languages of their respective regions, each with over one million speakers: [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]], [[Bikol language|Bikol]], [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]], [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]], and [[Tausug language|Tausug]].

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are used as auxiliary languages. The [[Spanish in the Philippines|use of Spanish in the Philippines]] as the original official language of the country has declined, only a small proportion of the population speaks it.

The [[Min Nan]] [[Identification of the varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialect]] is widely spoken by the country's Chinese minority.

{{main|Religion in the Philippines}}
[[دوتنه:Ci mla cathedral.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manila Cathedral]]

The Philippines is the third-largest Christian nation, after the [[The United States of America|United States]] and [[Brazil]].{{fact}} About 92 percent of all Filipinos are Christians: 83 percent belong to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], 2 percent belong to the [[Philippine Independent Church]], and 10 percent belong to various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations. Although Christianity is a major force in the culture of the Filipinos, a small minority practices [[animism]] with indigenous traditions and rituals.

Approximately 5 percent of Filipinos are [[Muslim]] and live primarily in parts of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu archipelago]]. Most lowland Muslim Filipinos practice normative Islam, although the practices of some Mindanao's hill tribe Muslims reflect a fusion with animism. The Muslims have resisted conquest and conversion for centuries by the Spanish and the Americans. Various Muslim groups have been waging a decades-long armed campaign against the Philippine government for political self-determination. In addition, 10 Muslim groups, mainly of Mindanao and Sulu, comprise about 4% of Muslims in the country.

There are also small populations of [[Buddhism in the Philippines|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism in the Philippines|Hindus]], and [[Jews in the Philippines|Jews]].

{{main|Culture of the Philippines}}
[[دوتنه:jeepney.jpg|240px|thumb|A Philippine Jeepney]]

Filipino culture is largely a blend of the indigenous traditions of the Philippines, with the Hispanic and [[Culture of the United States of America|American]] cultures.  It has also been significantly influenced by [[China|Chinese]], [[Indonesia]]n and [[India]]n cultures.

The [[Hispanic]] influences in Filipino culture are largely derived from the [[culture of Spain]] and Mexico as a result of over three centuries of [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial rule through Mexico City. These Hispanic influences are most evident in [[Roman Catholic Church]] religious festivals. [[Filipinos]] hold major festivities known as barrio [[Festival|fiestas]] to commemorate their patron [[saints]]. The most obvious Hispanic legacy, however, is the prevalence of [[Catálogo Alfabético de Apellidos|Spanish surnames among Filipinos]]. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial decree for the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of the [[Iberian naming customs|Spanish naming system]] on the inhabitants of the Philippines. A Spanish surname in the Phillipines doesn't denote a Hispanic heritage.

The [[China|Chinese]] influences in Filipino culture are most evident in Filipino cuisine. The prevalence of noodles, known locally as ''mami'', are a testament of the Chinese cuisine. Other Chinese influences include linguistic borrowings and the occasional Chinese derived surnames.

The use of English within the Philippines is America's most obvious legacy. The most commonly played and arguably the national sport in the Philippines is [[basketball]]. Indeed, there is a wide emulation of other American cultural trends, such as the love of [[fast-food]]; many street corners boast fast-food outlets. Aside from the American commercial giants such as [[McDonald's]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Burger King]], [[KFC]], and [[Shakey's]], local fast-food chains have also sprung up, including [[Jollibee]], [[Greenwich Pizza]], and [[Chowking]]. Filipinos listen to American music, watch American movies, and admire American actors and actresses, although Asian trends and culture have begun making inroads to the locals.

In spite of this, [[Indigenous people|native]] moral codes, respect of family, veneration of elders, and friendliness, all remain intact. Filipinos honor national heroes whose works and deeds contributed to the shaping of the Filipino nation. [[José Rizal]] is the most celebrated ''ilustrado'', a Spanish-speaking reformist visionary whose writings contributed greatly in nurturing a sense of national identity and awareness. His novels ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' originally written in Spanish, are required readings for Filipino students, and provide vignettes of colonial life under the Spanish rule. They give a sense of Filipino identity and historical continuity. Ninoy Aquino, the charismatic leader against the Marcos dictatorship, is a highly revered martyr of the People Power revolution.
