The '''Republic of Côte d'Ivoire''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA: pronunciation]]: /kot divwa/ or /kot divwar/; commonly called '''Ivory Coast''' in [[English language|English]]; see below about [[#The_name|the name]]) is a country in [[West Africa]]. It borders [[لايبېريا]] and [[ګونې]] to the west, [[مالي]] and [[بورکينا فاسو]] to the north, [[ګانا]] to the east, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to the south. One of the most prosperous of the tropical West African states, its economic development has been undermined by political turmoil spawned by official corruption and refusal to adopt needed reforms.

== تاريخ==
{{main|History of Côte d'Ivoire}}

Little is known about Côte d'Ivoire before the arrival of [[Europe]]an [[ships]] in the [[1460s]]. The major [[ethnic group]]s came relatively recently from neighbouring areas: the [[Kru]] people came from [[Liberia]] around [[1600]]; the [[Senoufo]] and [[Lobi]] moved southward from [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]]; in the [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century|19th]] centuries the [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] people, including the [[Baoulé]], migrated from [[Ghana]] into the eastern area of the country, and the [[Malinké]] from [[Guinea]] into the northwest.

Compared to neighbouring Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire suffered little from the [[slave trade]]. European slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast with better harbours. France took an interest in the [[1840s]], enticing local chiefs to grant French commercial traders a monopoly along the coast. Thereafter, the French built naval bases to keep out non-French traders and began a systematic conquest of the interior. They accomplished this only after a long war in the [[1890s]] against [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] forces, mostly from Gambia. [[Guerrilla warfare]] by the Baoulé and other eastern groups continued until [[1917]].

France's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. [[Coffee]], [[cocoa]] and [[palm oil]] crops were soon planted along the coast. Côte d'Ivoire stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of 'settlers'; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, the French and [[English people|English]] were largely bureaucrats. As a result, a third of the cocoa, coffee and [[banana]] [[plantation]]s were in the hands of French citizens and a hated forced-labour system became the backbone of the economy.

The son of a Baoulé chief, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] was to become Côte d'Ivoire's father of independence. In [[1944]] he formed the country's first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Annoyed that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris. A year later the French abolished forced labour. As Houphouët-Boigny grew fonder of money and power, and became more ingratiated with the French, he gradually dropped the more radical stance of his youth. France reciprocated by making him the first African to become a minister in a European government.

At the time of Côte d'Ivoire's independence in [[1960]], the country was easily French West Africa's most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region's total exports. When Houphouët-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices to further stimulate production. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting Côte d'Ivoire into third place in total output behind [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]]. By [[1979]] the country was the world's leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa's leading exporter of [[pineapples]] and palm oil. Behind the scenes, it was French technicians who had masterminded the programme, which was often referred to as the 'Ivoirian miracle'. In the rest of Africa, Europeans were driven out following independence; but in Côte d'Ivoire, they poured in. The French community grew from 10,000 to 50,000, most of them teachers and advisers. For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10% - the highest of Africa's non-oil exporting countries.

Politically, Houphouët-Boigny ruled with an iron hand. The press was not free, and only one political party was tolerated. Houphouët-Boigny was also Africa's number one producer of 'show' projects. So many millions of dollars were spent transforming his village, [[Yamoussoukro]], into the new capital that it became the butt of jokes. But by the early [[1980s]], the world recession and a local drought sent shockwaves through the Ivoirian economy. Thanks also to the overcutting of [[timber]] and collapsing [[sugar]] prices, the country's external debt increased threefold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan. The miracle was over.

In [[1990]], hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting institutional corruption. The unrest forced the government to support multiparty democracy. Houphouët-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in [[1993]]. He favoured [[Henri Konan Bédié]] as his successor.

In October [[1995]], Bédié overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, sending several hundred opposition supporters to jail. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt.

Unlike Houphouët-Boigny, who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to Ivorian nationality wide-open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedié emphasized the concept of "Ivority" ([[Ivoirité]]) to exclude his rival [[Alassane Ouattara]], having only one parent of Ivory Coast nationality, to run for future presidential election. As people originating from [[Burkina Faso]] are a large part of the Ivorian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivorian nationality, and relationship between various ethnic groups became strained.

Similarly, Bédié excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late [[1999]], a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General [[Robert Guéi]] in power. Bédié fled into exile in France. The coup had reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for austerity and openly campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.

A presidential election was held in [[October 2000]] in which [[Laurent Gbagbo]] vied with Guéi, but it was neither peaceful nor democratic. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Guéi's attempt to rig the election led to a public uprising, resulting in around 180 deaths and his swift replacement by the election's likely winner, Gbagbo. [[Alassane Ouattara]], was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court, due to his Burkinabé nationality. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country's [[Muslim]] north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.

On [[September 19]], [[2002]], troops mutinied and gained control of the north. In Abidjan, rebels seized the gendarmerie, and former president Guéi was murdered with fifteen persons in his home.  Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the French embassy.  What exactly happened that night is disputed; some report the events as a military coup attempt, but other sources report that opponents were executed by pro-Gbagbo [[death squad]]s and that the rebellion was an unplanned reaction.     

An early ceasefire with the rebels, who had the full backing of the northern populace (mostly of Burkinabé origin), proved short-lived and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.

In [[January 2003]], President Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a 'government of national unity'. Curfews were lifted and French troops cleaned up the lawless western border of the country. But the central problems remained, and neither side achieved its goals.

Since then, the unity government has proven extremely unstable. In [[March 2004]], 120 people were killed in an opposition rally. A later report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed, relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.

== سياست==
{{main|Politics of Côte d'Ivoire}}

The official capital since 1983 is Yamoussouk; however, Abidjan remains the administrative center.  Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan.  The population continues to suffer because of an on-going civil war.  International human rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive non-combatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child alimony among workers in cocoa production.

Since the incident on September 19, 2002 (refer to the history section), a civil war broke out, and the north part of the country has been seized by the rebels, the New Forces (FN). A new presidential election was expected to be held in January, 2005. However, this new election could not be held on time due to delay in the preparation.

== Administrative Divisions ==
{{main articles|[[Regions of Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Departments of Côte d'Ivoire]]}} 

Côte d'Ivoire is divided into 19 [[region]]s (''régions''), which are further divided into 58 [[department]]s (''départements'').

== جغرافيه==
[[Image:Côte d'Ivoire Map.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Map Of Côte d'Ivoire]]
{{main|Geography of Côte d'Ivoire}}

Côte d'Ivoire is a country of western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. It borders [[Liberia]] and [[Guinea]] in the west, [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] in the north, [[Ghana]] in the east, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] ([[Atlantic Ocean]]) in the south.

== اقتصاد==
{{main|Economy of Côte d'Ivoire}}

Maintaining  close ties to France since independence in [[1960]], diversification of agriculture for export, and encouragement of foreign investment has made C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African states.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Côte d'Ivoire}}

76% of the population are considered Ivorians. They belong to different peoples, which linguistically are summarized under the language groups of Kwa, Kru, Mande, and Gur. 

Since Cote d'Ivoire has established itself as one of the most successful west African nations, about 20% of the population consists of workers from neighbouring Liberia, Burkina Faso and Guinea. This fact has created steadily increasing tension in recent years, especially since most of these workers are [[Muslims]] while the native-born population is largely [[Christian]] (primarily [[Catholic Church in Cote d'Ivoire|Roman Catholic]]) and [[animist]]. 4% of the population is of non-African ancestry.  Many are [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Spain|Spanish]] citizens, as well as Protestant missionaries of American and Canadian background. In November 2004, around 10,000 French and other foreign nationals evacuated Cote d'Ivoire due to attacks from pro-government youth militias.

==The name==
===تاريخ===
The country was originally known in [[English language|English]] as ''Ivory Coast'', and corresponding translations in other languages: ''Elfenbeinküste'' in [[German language|German]], ''Costa de Marfil'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Costa do Marfim'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Ivoorkust'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and so on. In October [[1985]] the government requested that the country be known as Côte d'Ivoire in every language. In fact, according to national law, the name of the country cannot be translated from French. Of course, this law can only apply within the country itself.

===Usage===
Despite the Ivorian government's ruling, "Ivory Coast" (sometimes "the Ivory Coast") is still the most commonly used name in English. Governments, however, use "Côte d'Ivoire" for diplomatic reasons. Journalistic [[style guide]]s usually (but not always) recommend "Ivory Coast":

*''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's [http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,5817,184827,00.html Style Guide] says: "Ivory Coast, not "the Ivory Coast" or "Côte D'Ivoire"; its nationals are '''Ivorians'''"
*The [[BBC]] usually uses "Ivory Coast" both in news reports and on its page about the country [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/country_profiles/1043014.stm].
*''[[The Economist]]'' newsmagazine's [http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=805717 Style Guide] says "'''Côte d'Ivoire''' not '''Ivory Coast'''".
*The [[United States Department of State]] uses "Côte d'Ivoire" in formal documents, but uses "Ivory Coast" in many general references, speeches and briefing documents [http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/2005/43552.htm]. 
*''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' uses "Côte d'Ivoire".
*[[ABC News]], ''[[The Times]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'' and [[SABC]] all use "Ivory Coast" either exclusively or predominantly.
